0,Ben W,6h ago,The best movie of all time,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
1,Aidan B,3d ago,"It provides groundbreaking CGI and is a well-acted film, however, the extremely generic story and mediocre plot end up bogging this film down. I think Cameron does a good job in directing this film, and the idea and worldbuilding was very well, however, the execution is poor as it just feels way more generic than it should have been. The acting is well though, and the CGI is phenomenal. There were also several plot holes, though I do hold hope that the planned sequel does expand well upon this film and better explains a lot of the things that occur. Overall, an entertaining film, just not one of Cameron's best works due to its lacking story.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
2,Rob T,"Nov 11, 2021","I didn't watch this in 3D but I did watch this on a big screen (not some 65"" TV) so I admit the visuals are quality but I'm guessing the 3D adds a lot more to the visuals. The story itself is unique, though there are some occasional scratch-your-head moments. I may be in the minority but it felt a bit weird to root for the romantic inter-species relationship. Still, overall a fairly decent piece of entertainment.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
3,Jon S,"Nov 10, 2021","Spectacular 3D visuals. Everything else (plot, character, dialogue, acting, pacing) was middling to bad.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
4,Michael P,"Oct 24, 2021","Unfortunately, this movie just hasn't aged well over the years. While the visuals are stunning (Pandora's flora and fauna) where built really well, great lighting, great photography work and the human portion of the dialogue isn't bad either, I just can't get past two big things in this movie a) the dialogue of the Na'vi - I mean, that is the best they could come up with? and b) the story arc - the movie is basically a mashup of Dances w/ Wolves, FernGully, and Pocahontas. Sure it isn't a complete 1 for 1, but for someone who had a lot of time to work on the story line, this is the best James C could come up with? (Dances w/ Wolves in Outer Space?) The technological concepts are good, but the story overtime, it just gets worse everytime I watch it. I cringe when I hear the Na'vi rally cry, its just culturally...well, insensitive. In this regard, the Na'vi language isn't original...of course, its a unique language completely made up (Frommer took inspiration from the Maori language)....and I guess that is my problem here. The vocal range is human, the language is based off a human language, the pitch and frequency of the spoken language is human. It just doesn't make a lot of sense...think about it, we share 98.8% of our DNA with chimpanzees, 70% of our DNA with zebrafish, and 60% of our DNA with bananas, and we sound NOTHING ALIKE! ;-) We travel to another fictional part of the universe and the Na'vi just happen to sound like one of our Polynesian languages hear on earth? If they are in the process of are being unoriginal, they could have at least given the Na'vi a proper Haka War Cry.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
5,Shane B,"Oct 20, 2021","When you take away the CGI and 3D effects, the movie itself isn't great. Go to a planetarium, you'll save some time. Dud!",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
6,Andrew M,"Oct 08, 2021","The world of Avatar is absolutely stunning. The visuals are remarkable, The Na'vi culture is very rich and Zoe Saldana does an amazing job in this film. A lot of hard work was put into this movie and it shows.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
7,Robb D,"Sep 09, 2021","What Avatar lacks in originality, it easily makes up for with stunning visuals and some amazing action. Cameron is a genius with a camera and his mastery is on full display to anyone who can view this beautiful film in the best HD resolution possible. 9/10",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
8,Eric P,"Aug 28, 2021",Here is a film that is truly amazing! The visual effects in this were one of a kind that were special and effective. The music and the scenes in Avatar gave me emotional feelings where I almost teared up. The action sequences in this film are amazing as well. One could argue that this movie is just Dances with Wolves knock-off with a hint of science fiction but the positives outweigh the negatives. James Cameron did a very phenomenal job directing this film.,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
9,Jordan H,"Aug 24, 2021",Cookie cutter plot. Saw it for the novelty of new 3D in 2009. No need to ever watch it again.,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews

16,Robert P,"Jul 23, 2021","The most expensive film to make, and currently it holds the biggest gross returns in history, I can only say this is the ultimate sci-fi adventure you can see to date!",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
17,"Jul 18, 2021","Probably the best Disney movie I've ever seen, ahead of it's time, watched it in theaters back then with 3d glasses and it blew any 3d movie out the water",FLAG THIS REVIEW,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
18,Dean S,"Jul 17, 2021",Saw in the movies in 3D so that was fun. But the story itself was pretty cheesy. I'm glad James Cameron stopped this nonsense and is now focusing on the epic story of Alita the Battle Angel.,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
19,Joe D,"Jul 11, 2021","To me this is the most perfect blockbuster of all. Love Sam Worthington's empty cup, I find his everyman acting compelling, Saldana may be the most beautiful woman on the planet with her trademark perfect posture, and Sigourney adds class with extra to spare wherever she goes. The planet Pandora remains the real star, and the revelation that we're the bad guys and the spiritual tree-huggers were right all along, I find genuinely touching every time. First class and I can't wait for more of Cameron's magic touch.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
20,Jimmy W,"Jul 10, 2021","The fact that this movie can make the most money of all time and also gain a following of hive-minded morons to defend it says more about the state of society than it does the movie itself. For a movie that's meant to make a point about abusive use of the environment, they sure seem to indulge in the use of massive amounts of expensive technology that no doubt utilized way more than its fair share of natural resources. Oh well, at least you can pretend to be vindicated by the box office numbers.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
21,Goudkuil E,"Jun 29, 2021","Apart from the visuals everything feels uninspired and thrown together using a old cliche of an outsider seeing what's wrong with what he's people have been doing falling in love then whiching sides. The acting is ok, the dialogue is kinda rough. The movie is padded with a lot of nice scenique views with no real narrative meaning.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
22,Antonio D,"Jun 15, 2021","o filme possui uma fotografia muito bela e, mesmo o filme sendo de 2009 não conseguimos encontrar defeitos em relação a montagem e fotografia, a história é satisfatória e é um reflexo do que sabemos que aconteceu no inicio da colonização",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
23,Tyler W,"Jun 11, 2021","The visuals were revolutionary for the time. But story matters and to the extent this film had a plot, it was borrowed from FernGully and Dances with Wolves.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
24,Noah H,"Jun 08, 2021","Great film through and through. The plot is excellent and engaging, and the character development is of a very high standard. Although it is a very long film, every scene adds to the atmosphere. Definitely worth watching - you won't regret it!",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
25,Erick F,"May 28, 2021","Filme perfeito. Edição, imagens, efeitos, narrativa, roteiro, atuações, planos de sequências. Incrivelmente extraordinário, te transporta para a incrível realidade de Pandora, e faz você de lá nunca mais querer voltar. Película completamente por múltiplas razões.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
26,Nathan t,"May 28, 2021","Avatar is an American science fiction film, directed by James Cameron and released in 2009. In this film we can find many guess like Sam Worthington or Sigourney Weaver. They portray Jake Sully and Dr. Grace Augustine. The main character Jake Sully try to understand how does a new specie live in Pandora. The film is about the probably future of humanity. The humans have deleted all the ressources of the earth, so they try to visit others planets for maybe find minerals. During this film we are on Pandora, a moon of a new planet. Human species can live in the Pandora's atmosphere, but scientist found a possibility to go discover all the planet. Take control of humanoids who live in Pandora. So we follow Jake Sully and Dr. Grace Augustin who will try to make contact with Eywa the chief of this new population. When I watched this movie for the first time the plot convinced me, because it is unpredictable and highly absorbing. There are many unexpected during all the movie. I must talk to you about the special effects. This movie is, for me, the most staggering film of the last 10 years. All jungle and humanoids made with special effects, the colors and the mood are very special. Each flowers or trees are detailed. It is perfectly stunning. The photography also is breathtaking, colors enable to convince all the viewers. There different cinematography techniques which give a beautiful introduction and transitions during the movie. Actors, portrayed, a human character but also a humanoid character, they must keep the same attitude and the same mouvements when they represented creatures. Each actor is natural and it's likeable to see. To sum up, I can say that this movie must be watch by everybody. With all work to make the special effects and the script, this movie seem prefect.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
27,Jasper S,"May 27, 2021","De wereld van avatar roept bij mij vooral emoties van verwondering op. De wereld is zo wonder schoon en goed uitgewerkt. Je kan de hele film 2 keer kijken 1 keer voor de film zelf en de tweede keer voor de visuals. Het best voor deze film is om hem in de bioscoop te bekijken. Daar in die donkere bioscoop waar niks uitmaakt behalve de film worden bijna alle zintuigen geprikkeld. De dolby atmos surround sound zorgt ervoor dat jou oren alles meekrijgen wat er om jou heen gebeurt. Van het kogelschot rechts voor naar het fluitende vogeltje links achter. Het grote doek zorgt ervoor data jou hele gezicht veld word opgenomen door deze adem benemende film. Je voelt misschien niks fysiek op je huid neerkomen maar als jij kippenvel krijgt van de film merk jij dat heus. Het jammere is dat je de film niet kan ruiken of proeven wat zou dat een beleving zijn. Dan zou er bijna geen verschil meer zitten tussen film en realiteit. Deze wereld bevind zich in het universum met de aarde. De wereld zelf bevind zich echter op een andere planeet binnen dit universum. De wereld lijkt erg op de aarde met het aantal gewassen die overal staan alleen is alles een stuk groter. James Cameron is de regisseur en schrijver van de film. Dus de wereld is in zijn hoofd gemaakt. De mensen die de wereld daadwerkelijk gemaakt hebben zoals jij het in de bioscoop mag zien is gemaakt door een groep van meer dan 1000 mensen een gigantische computer server en een groot budget. Filmen begon in april 2007. Dat betekent natuurlijk niet dat deze film toen al af was want hij was pas in december 2009 te zien in de bioscopen. Avatar is een box office film gedirigeerd en geschreven door James Cameron die zich afspeelt op een andere planeet. De boodschap van avatar is dat je zuinig moet zijn op je grondstoffen. En je zuinig moet zijn op de planeet waarop je woont. De doelgroep van Avatar is iedereen die van films houd vooral van een beetje science fiction. Er zit niet perse een leeftijd grens aan de film je moet alleen wel 13 zijn om de film te kunnen zien. Het verhaal van de wereld is dat de aarde niet meer goed bewoonbaar is en de mensen van de aarde naar een andere planeet gaan om daar grondstoffen te verkrijgen om rijk te worden. De hoofdrolspeler is een man die geen functionaliteit meer heeft in zijn benen en naar de planeet komt voor onderzoek. Hij gaat zichzelf over zetten in een lichaam van de inboorlingen waarin hij ook weer kan lopen. Het conflict van het verhaal is tussen mens/machine en inboorling/natuur. De inboorlingen houden namelijk van hun wereld en behandelen de wereld met de respect dat die nodig heeft en de mensen komen alles kapot maken. De hoofdrol speler zorgt ervoor dat er een connectie gelegd word tussen mens en inboorling maar stapt uiteindelijk over naar de kant van de inboorlingen om hun te helpen mens te verslaan. De characters Bestaan uit mensen, mensen in machines, Na'vi (inboorling), en meerdere dieren. In de wereld waar de mensen komen is alles een stuk groter dus de mensen maken exoskeletons om een kans te hebben. De Na'vi aan de andere kant zijn zo in toon met de natuur dat is een vlecht hebben waarmee ze een band kunnen maken met dieren. De sferen die in het verhaal komen zijn heel wissel valig door de film heen. In het begin is het vooral leuk dat je alles kan ontdekken en sta je achter de mensen. Als de hoofdpersoon met zijn lichaam van een na'vi het kamp van de na'vi binnen komt is er vooral liefde. Daarna sta je achter de na'vi en is er vooral verdriet over de destructie van de mensen. Maar op het eind is het euforie door de overwinning van de na'vi. Een hele achtbaan aan sferen dus De film word foto realistisch vorm gegeven op een 2d doek. Ook 3d als je de bioscoop extra betaald en je een bril opdoet. Het thema van de wereld is natuur en duurzaamheid.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews

36,"Apr 27, 2021","The main film of the year 2009 is «Avatar» by James Cameron, the producer of such films as «Terminator», «Titanic», «The Strangers». This film ranks with above-mentioned world-famous films and probably belongs to the science-fiction genre. The action of the film is set on the planet Pandora in the year of 3000. The plot is rather simple: the super hero Avatar is to save the alien planet and to fulfill this mission he struggles with a lot of difficulties. The main character, Jack Sally, is a disabled navy who has just come back from the war. The film starts with the scene when he is invited to take part in a secret expedition to the planet, inhabited by weird creatures. Thus, he becomes the part of the programme called Avatar. Being turned into a a three-metre giant with blue skin, he is sent to the planet with the help of special «drivers» that link his mind to the mind of Avatar. What impressed me most is the spectacular world of aliens that we, the audience, see through the eyes of the main character. The special effects and 3D technologies enhance the impression of the bright and colourful world in contrast to the human one, which is grey and dying. The plot of the film is fast-moving with some amusing episodes. For those who are indifferent to the computer graphics, there is another storyline that is love of «the dream worker» to a beautiful female alien, who, being hostile and suspicious at first, falls in love with him. Such love is forbidden and as a result the pair is chased by the aliens. Happily, they managed to escape in the end. To my mind, the brillant acting of Sam Worthingdon, who is starring in the film, is above all expectations. To sum up, I can say that the film «Avatar» is that kind of film that takes us to a special world beyond imagination. More than that, it is the film that you want to watch over and over again. Definitely, the new film by Cameron couldn't be missed.",SHOW MORE,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews

This is one movie that Just HAD to be seen in 3D! Loved it! Great action, special effects and a powerful story. The story has similarities from both Fern Gully and Dances with Wolves. I was blown away!! James Cameron did a great Job of creating this new world of Pandora and the Navi and the Beautiful creatures of this world. The cast such as leads Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana also did a tremendous job!

It's what I expected to see, after they've invested over $ 350 million doing it. And it's definitely what I was hoping to see to dramatically close a franchise that, in my opinion, should take a break so as not to saturate the genre.

59,Alex T,"Nov 16, 2021","I've always liked Marvel comics and followed the movies somewhat as a result, never really following the MCU, but due to movies like Endgame I feel like I'm really falling out with the fanbase. My view of Endgame is its just overrated beyond belief, I think the premise is okay in the sense that it ties all the previous movies up and includes many of the characters but its bad in the way in how destructive it is, disabling any kind of meaningful progression in the franchise. I feel in this way, the deaths in this film and the one before it are hollow where they have little meaning due to them being resurrected in a spinoff or in canon. Admittedly the special effects are impressive and the sheer scope of the movie is as well but is undermined by a destructive and substance-less story in addition to the its copious runtime. I'm sorry Marvel, you've lost me on this one.",Avengers: Endgame,Avengers: Endgame - Movie Reviews
60,Aidan B,"Nov 16, 2021","A fine film that, in my eyes, feels very overrated. The comedy feels more forced, the story is just constant fan-service, and the final fight scene feels more cringe than epic due to the goofiness of some of the choices they made (ie all the Avengers running in a line). While the beginning and ending was admittedly great, and the acting is still as good as ever, ""Avengers: Endgame"" just fails to hold a light to some of the far better installments in the MCU. While I still found the film to be mostly enjoyable, I was able to find enough glaring flaws during my rewatch to bring the score down.",Avengers: Endgame,Avengers: Endgame - Movie Reviews
61,Vito N,"Nov 15, 2021","After much thought I have come to the conclusion that this is my Favorite Movie of All Time. It's 3 hours long, and it's all worth it. There's so much to talk about this film whether it's the drama between Cap and his final fight, Tony and coming to peace with his father, or Thor realizing that it's him that makes the lighting and not the lightning that makes him. The action is the best it's ever been, the CGI is world class as always, and the performances from the entire ensemble cast is as good as it'll ever be. Is it a perfect film? Heck no, but it's as close to perfect as you could ever get, and it comes pretty damn close.

This classic movie has revolutionary CGI for its time, with the classic story of star-crossed-lovers transitioned to the Titanic perfectly, this film remains one of Cameron's best works ever put on the big screen.

85,Money G,"Nov 09, 2021","CMON! I was expecting more from the characters. I grew up in America and this is a movie commonly referenced in conversation. Sadly, it is a reflection of American taste and depth more than it is a beautiful movie. James Cameron extends greater consideration towards budget, set design, a panning camera, and scope of grandeur and disaster than what I identify as the real conflict worth tears. Not one person survived with a Third Class ticket. The rich negotiate, offer leverage, hide in spacious lifeboats and Rose survives instead of Jack. This is an accurate story but should be received as a tragedy instead of a romance. What lines of memorable dialogue are there? They pass the plot along, the ship must sink. There are memorable visuals, the set is magnificent, and the scene where voices stop and are frozen is excellent. However, unlike the iceberg, there is not enough depth.",Titanic,Titanic - Movie Reviews

100,Romina R,"Aug 30, 2021","There is a trend happening more now than ever where people hate on classic films for the sake of hating because they are classic films and loved by the majority of the public. As I start this ""Re-watching and Re-visiting films"" series, I will be repeating this many times. I do not quite get people's issue and ""beef"" (to put it less sophisticated) with Titanic. Is it one of the best movies of all time? Not quite. Is it a really well-done film that stays in our minds years and years after seeing it for the first time and if it is playing on a TV channel, you put it on? Why, yes. I understand the bother with a ""pointless"" love story plot line for dramatization but what's funny is that it works with the strong performances and magical chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet. But what I want to focus on in Titanic is the little scenes. There are many scenes where the tears uncontrollably fall down your face. Towards more the last section of the film where the boat officially sunk down, there is a shot from sky above of all the passengers screaming and flapping around the water. Up close, it is suffocating hysteria and from afar, it is just one sound in the middle of the gigantic ocean. People being left to die (as there are themes being shown of the lower class being purposely cast aside and the rich prioritized) and people coming to terms this might be their last breath on earth. Playing with camera angles intensifies a small scene for a viewer and makes that small scene stand out in a 3 hour movie.",Titanic,Titanic - Movie Reviews
101,JOHN U,"Aug 29, 2021","Shmaltzy, overly long, ridiculously well crafted and disarmingly heartfelt this movie is just larger than life. I think it's pacing problems are best summed up by the very first scene where Bill Paxton's character essentially does the same gag twice with the exact same reaction from his crewmember. Everything that is done in the present day in this film is essentially useless and definitely provides the most unnecessary though not the only element that makes this movie as grandiose as it is. I was ok with it all, but it made the film seem redundant in a lot of places. Do the present-day scenes add to the film? Yes, but only incidentally, it does put us in the frame of mind of the impending tragedy in a very delicate way and makes for a very meaningful and lovely ending scene but all of that was accomplishable in much less time-consuming ways. After all, the love story is the heart of the film, it would have been perfectly acceptable to keep it to just that. What happens on the Titanic is what really sets this movie apart. At it's core this is a romance and that's what gives the wide appeal of the film but in general terms, this is an absolute masterclass (and I can't stress that enough) in disaster film. I got the feeling that that was what drew James Cameron to the Titanic as a potential film, the slow sinking of such a lavish set piece, the impending and ever nearing doom as the water chases after our heroes as they struggle to survive. It is in the disaster elements (and in the glorious shots of the Titanic before that) that the film is entirely justified in it's longevity. The scale of such a disaster demands a film of such scale and Cameron was certainly the filmmaker, perhaps the only filmmaker, who was truly up to the challenge of giving the Titanic justice. So in terms of destruction, this movie absolutely floored me not even mentioning the staggeringly large scale and lavish set design. The scenes in the engine room particularly gave off a visceral sense of largeness and power that was awesome to behold even on my computer screen and the shots of the Titanic's propellers rearing from the water literally took my breath away. Its like this movie's sets are beefy. That's the word that came to me while watching it, I don't know why but that's what I thought. Of course, no amount of excellent cinematography, special effects, set design, music or sound editing will make a complete film and since we all know the story, a genuine personal touch was necessary for this movie to really excel. Well, I won't call it genuine per se but I will call it just as larger than life than the ship it took place on. I don't think it's a secret to anyone just how melodramatic this movie's nuclear romance between poor artist Jack and unsatisfied rich girl Rose is. I suppose it's also cliché to a point but I didn't really mind (it helped soften the cliches when James Horner's score just leans into the schmaltz with full force) I think the film does a good enough job with building up it's emotional center and it sprinkles in enough universally pitiable scenarios (the musicians, the babies, the families) to make it personally devastating as the long, slow burn of the Titanic's destruction unfolds in all of it's glory. The story didn't really hold any long-lasting meaning, but I don't mind that either, it was just a story aiming to be a crowd pleaser and a white knuckler at the same time, and it succeeded really well at both. I liked the whole ""jump together"" motif. Somehow, I didn't see its payoff coming and old Rose throwing the heart of the ocean into the sea really spoke some volumes about something… I don't know, it was emotionally resonant at the time. Came for the destruction, stayed with the romance long enough to actually get to the destruction and enjoyed the sweet, admittedly pretentious ending.",Titanic,Titanic - Movie Reviews

James Cameron achieved something remarkable in Titanic, with his relentless attention to detail, perfect direction and clever use of every trick in the special effects book to take the viewer aboard the great ship as she set sail in April, 1912. The underlying Romeo and Juliet love story of the film's two central characters, Jack and Rose, is engaging and bought to life by the perfectly cast Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet, who have just enough chemistry to make you care about their love story. A fantastic supporting cast of quality actors, perfectly cast, helps to bring this modern remake of A Night To Remember to life. You realise you have completely bought into the movie when you feel utter dread during the sinking scenes. Definitely one of the all-time greatest movies ever made.

The set is magnificent and the contrast between rich and poor as well as society expectation and free will is handled really well but the moment the ship hits the iceberg, it's near perfect. You truly feel the tension and fright as we see the effect of the sinking on so many people as well as the (let's be honest) terrible organization of the crew and the visuals hage aged super well. Hard to believe it's a 1997 movie. And gosh that last half made me cry, seeing the hopelessness of many of the victims and of course, Jack's death. I'm still pissed that Jack died but that bastard Cal survived. But still, incredible. It's definitely slow at times.

It is still just the third highest grossing film ever (however part of that comes from the 3-D rerelease) and still is quoted and talked about constantly to this day. Now is it a perfect movie, no. Is it overrated, absolutely. But there is still such a great nature to it that makes it honestly hard not to love (at least slightly). The first 90 minutes of the movie is essentially just a chick flick (and the writing is not the best) but it has such a charm to it and Leo and Kate’s chemistry is so likable that you can’t help but enjoy it (even if it isn’t the best). Then the rest becomes a completely different movie almost, as we see the titanic sink. This is where the movie really becomes phenomenal. The effects done and the cinematography and shots we get are great. Even though I’ve never really liked James Cameron much as a person you deny that he is a great director, especially with action scenes like the end to the movie. The entire last half of this movie is completely thrilling to watch and also it is heartbreaking when (spoiler alert) Jack dies (but you probably already knew that).

127,Aidan B,"Nov 20, 2021","""The Force Awakens"" opens this new ""Star Wars"" trilogy to an entertaining start, with groundbreaking CGI and action sequences, this film is easily the best in the whole trilogy. The new characters and places introduced are not entirely fresh or memorable, though they fit well into the story. Speaking of the story, I thought that this film was heading in a very interesting direction by making Finn, a stormtrooper that betrays the First Order, learn the ways of the Force. I also liked the character Rey, though I don't think that she should've been the main focus of the film. Kylo Ren is a very well done and emotional character though, and his connection to Darth Vader adds all the more depth to his character. Where I think this film fails, however, is the constant fan service that is done, which isn't done in a very creative way, rather it seems more of a cheat for that extra ""Hey I recognize that"" moment. It often plays on the nostalgia of those that grew up with the previous films and uses that nostalgia to power its main story.

154,Jacob B,"Sep 16, 2021",Star Wars 7: The force awakens (A-) (90%) Movie had so much hype before it's release and j.j. Abrams did a good job with it. Really wish that there was a more cohesive story throught the rest of the trilogy which ticks it down a bit now for me. But this movie and the other movies of the trilogy work better on their own then together. This movie in specific is just a whole lot of fun. Love seeing the rise of Kylo Ren (my favorite character from the sequels) and Harrison Ford back in action. Fun watch but don't get to attached to where the plot is taking the story in the other movies.,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Movie Reviews

It has a large number of characters, and I like that each one has their moment to shine, that's a plus point. The actions of each character are completely justified, Thanos as the main antagonist is perfect, the reasons for which he acts are given and he gives more richness to the film. Anyway, you can not stay without seeing Infinity War, it is a good movie but I think it was enough for more, that if, this does not prevent you from enjoying it at all.",Avengers: Infinity War,Avengers: Infinity War - Movie Reviews

214,Jon M,"Sep 23, 2021","The word ""soulless"" covers most of my issue. The voice acting was entirely lacking heart, and in some cases was simply given poor direction. (Mufasa roars, and asks ""Is that a challenge?"" As if he's inviting Scar to tea.) John Oliver was entirely out of his depth, Ejiofor gives zero malice to the role, Beyonce over-sings every line, and Seth Rogen's perfectly played irreverence stands as the one bright spot.

215,Jayden D,"Sep 22, 2021","I have NOT been a fan of the rehashed remakes that Disney have put out as of late (Beauty & The Beast, Aladdin, Mulan...UGH...,Lady & The Tramp...not bad but mediocre) though I have 2 exceptions, The Jungle Book and this latest rendition of The Lion King. To be real, there's never gonna be a Lion King rendition that's gonna come anywhere close to the 1994 classic, let's be honest with ourselves. However for it's credit, this remake did not want to make me leave the theater in disgust. If anything it's a good movie that it's worth a watch, you just gotta dial down your expectations of the movie because some parts of it are kinda watered down and a bit of filler moments are put in there too which would explain this movie being 25 minutes longer than the original. Other than that, it does follow the script to the letter and makes for a good nostalgia high with modernized graphics. Props to the CGI team, this movie does look beautiful, probably the highest mark of the movie. It's not a bad Disney movie at all, the unfortunate part is that it does not surpass what the animated classic has already brought out to us and those are shoes that are almost impossible to fill so I can understand this movie falling short in some parts. It does make for a good comparison of what is being brought to this generation versus what my generation got as a kid growing up in the 90's.",The Lion King,The Lion King - Movie Reviews

It feels less like a remake or re-imagining than a remaster - viewers who want a new spin on a classic will be disappointed to find they are paying to see a movie they've already seen (albeit with a new coat of paint). While it's a shame that director/producer Jon Favreau added nothing new to this tale (despite proving his capabilities with 2016's vivid and fresh 'The Jungle Book') it manages to retain the soul of the original and is sufficiently entertaining. Excellent voice and vocal performances couple with stunningly life-like depictions of wild Africa and it's animal inhabitants to satisfy fans hoping to relive an old favorite, while offering new viewers an experience approximate to what the rest of us experienced in 1994, albeit with less facially emotive animals.",The Lion King,The Lion King - Movie Reviews

269,Michael S,"Dec 23, 2018","As any hardcore fan of the TV series knows, no actress was ever going to be able to fill the tights of icons like Honor Blackman and Diana Rigg. The producers should have known such fans would provide not an instant audience but an army of instant deplorers many of whom notoriously refused to even see the movie. What idiot producer then provides not just one unacceptable Uma, but adds a second unacceptable Uma in the bargain (Uma's dual role as both Emma Peel and nemesis)? Poor Uma never stood a chance, given she is a notoriously verveless actress especially compared to Diana Rigg. Uma turned out to be much more suited to originating roles that she was capable of playing (see Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill). As bad an idea as casting Thurman (or anyone in a film that shouldn't have been made), there was a great idea in casting Connery as the Bondian villain and this was the only potential drawing power the film really had (it was the only reason I went to see it!). Connery appears to be having the time of his life portraying the essence of maniacal glee. The script is awful, even if the science is not gibberish it's delivered at such breakneck speed it comes off as such. The actors spout dialogue at each other to zero reaction, like each one is occupying a separate room. Fiennes is credible in the action scenes, but otherwise is so bland as to blend into the wallpaper. If Patrick MacNee had feared being outdone in the role, they turned out to be groundless. If you actually need a reason to watch this, there are a few good moments reminiscent of Peel-era idiosyncratic oddball Avengers style moments, such as the Spectre-like villains meeting at a round table disguised as different colored teddy bears.",The Avengers,The Avengers - Movie Reviews

The two head off to the Ministry to meet Mother (Jim Broadbent), who informs them the Prospero project - an attempt to influence the weather - was sabotaged apparently by Emma Peel. Dr. Peel claims she is innocent, but she is sent to work alongside Steed to find the real culprit. Mother's off-sider, Father (Fiona Shaw), claims Peel suffers from a mental disease. They go off to visit Sir August De Wynter (Sean Connery), an old ally of The Ministry. He takes an instant liking to Peel, as they both share a love of weather. Steed and Emma follow a lead to Wonderland Weather - a business that artificially creates heat or rain with a special machine - where they discover two dead men in teddy bear suits. The members of a secret organisation - led by De Wynter - all wear teddy bear suits to disguise their identities. One of them, however, looks exactly like Emma Peel. Steed arrives in time to save Peel, as the double jumps off a roof and disappears. Steed and Emma go off to visit De Wynter at his mansion but are attacked by mechanical bees. Alice (Eileen Atkins), a Ministry agent, helps them to flee; nevertheless, De Wynter captures Emma who then tries to escape but finds herself trapped due to the mansion's ever-changing floor plan. She smashes her way through a window, and Steed rescues her. Back at Steed's apartment, however, Peel is arrested by Father, as Steed visits Invisible Jones (Patrick MacNee), a man inside The Ministry, to investigate the meaning of a map Steed found at Wonderland Weather. After viewing some photos of failed genetic experiments including cloning (revealing that the other Emma Peel is a clone), Steed determines Father is working with De Wynter. Father and Peel's clone capture Peel but are confronted by Mother, who is then incapacitated. De Wynter, controlling Prospero and the weather, confronts the world's leaders. He boasts that he controls the weather, and they will have to buy the weather from him, will pay a lot for it, and will have until midnight to pay... ""The Avengers"" is a 1998 American action spy film adaptation of the British television series of the same name that ran between 1961-1969. Warner Bros., the film's distributor, refused to allow any early press-screenings for movie reviewers that most releases attempt to generate interest in; such a decision is often made when a studio and/or distributor knows a film will not be received well and pre-release reviews would only be negative. The film was originally scheduled to open earlier in June 1998 but was pushed back until August, often referred to as the late-summer ""dumping ground"" for films that are not felt to be strong or worthy enough to open on the more lucrative holiday weekends in early summer. The film was a notable failure at the box office, grossing only $48 million worldwide, compared to its budget of $60 million. Mick LaSalle, of the San Francisco Chronicle, warned against poor editing and direction, explaining; ""There's.......some business involving a dead ringer for Emma going around causing trouble, and there's some mention of the word ""cloning."" Then all talk of that is dropped. Everything is dropped. After a slow opening, the 90-minute movie jolts into climax mode. What happened to the middle? Clearly, this wasn't just edited but gutted. No doubt they did us all a favor, but it doesn't help. Instead of just being a bad picture, the missing middle makes ""The Avengers"" a bad and weird and strangely off picture. One example: There's never a moment when Emma and Steed realize who the villain is. At first, they don't know. Next, they're in a titanic battle to the death. At one point, Emma is shackled and floating around in a hot-air balloon. I don't know how she got there. I must have blinked. Due to internal wrangling at Warner Bros., the decision was made to vastly cut down the running time after test screenings, reducing the 115-minute film to 87 minutes, sacrificing much coherence and continuity in the process. Key scenes removed included the opening sequence in which ""Mrs. Peel"" infiltrates and destroys the Prospero science installation; early trailers included the scene where she says the words ""How now brown cow"" in a false telephone box to gain admittance. The movie was originally scored by composer Michael Kamen, who included the original Avengers theme; however he was unable to re-score the film after the radical editing, so was forced to drop out. The recut version of the film was scored by Joel McNeely. The original script was used for the film's novelization and included all the material which were first shot and then removed from the film. The original cut has yet to surface; Warner Bros. has no plans to release a director's cut or special edition in any form, despite that director Jeremiah Chechik has offered to recut the film for free. The film was panned by critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes consensus reads, ""A TV spinoff that lacks enough energy to spin, The Avengers is an ineptly written, woefully miscast disaster."" The purists disliked it for its disrespect to the original series (particularly the introduction of a romance between Steed and Peel - a carefully ambiguous subject in the series). Newcomers were lost by all of the misfired attempts to capture the mood of the original. Rod Dreher in the New York Post called the film ""a big fat gob of maximum crapulosity, the kind of shallow, stupid, big-budget cow pile that smells of Joel Schumacher"", referencing the previous summer's likewise poorly received Batman & Robin, which also starred Uma Thurman. David Bianculli stated, ""This Avengers film is so horrendously, painfully, and thoroughly awful that it gives other cinematic clunkers like Ishtar and Howard the Duck a good name."" Jay Boyer in the Orlando Sentinel said ""The Avengers is, without a doubt, the worst movie of the summer"". Reception in Britain was equally hostile. The Birmingham Post stated ""The Avengers is being slated by critics as the worst film ever made - such a turkey, says one, that the makers should have handed distribution to (mass turkey producer) Bernard Matthews"". Alan Jones in The Radio Times stated ""The cult 1960s TV series gets royally shafted by Hollywood in this stunningly designed blockbuster that's stunningly awful in every other department... Terrible special effects and zero chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman make this notorious disaster a total waste of everyone's time and energy."" Commenting on the truncated released cut of the film, New York Times's Janet Maslin noted, ""At a pared-down, barely rational 90 minutes, ""The Avengers"" is short but not short enough."" I did not grow up with the original ""The Avengers"" (1961-1969) but I know of the show, the main characters and the actors. This is yet another example of a film that was slaughtered in the editing room when they reduced the 115-minute film to 87 minutes, sacrificing much coherence and continuity in the process. Everything in the film feels random, campy, poor and as said there´s no coherence nor continuity which gives us a very confusing film. With A-list stars like Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman and Sean Connery you´d think there would be potential, but the end result is far from it. All three seems to have no idea what´s going on due to mediocre direction. I reckon charm, style and fun was the main pillars of the tv-show, but with the film all of that is not in place. It´s a weird and strange unfunny film in many ways and you really struggle to find anything that is good about it. The effects are shoddy and the script silly in an Austin Powers way. Once the colourful teddybears appears in the film you realise that this film will never recover. Trivia: Peter Bart's book ""The Gross"" covered the film's unfolding disaster in great detail. Among other facts: Warner Brothers greenlit the film largely on the strength of a star-packed cast and their appreciation of Jeremiah Chechik's work on Diabolique (1996) and were horrified when seeing what the first cut was like. The first screening took place in front of a ""largely Spanish-speaking, working class"" audience in Phoenix, Arizona, who hated the film; the studio then forced Chechik to cut many of his favorite scenes, and conduct reshoots; and the final cut went from 115 to 89 minutes, and was completely incoherent. The studio even refused to hold further test screenings, or to have an official premiere before the film's August 1998 release. Ralph Fiennes said of the film, ""I think it's a badge of honor to have a real flop on your resumé"".",The Avengers,The Avengers - Movie Reviews

It's not deep and only clever in its small details, but it is well constructed, well paced, well choreographed and features the type of performances perfect for a cast of actors who are mid-level at acting, but big on charisma. The actual bits where the cars go fast are intense, intricate and extremely well staged & well executed. Even better, this movie features a central villain played wonderfully by Statham and a muscle-baddie played by the always amazing Tony Jaa, and while the latter is notably underused, both of them are a lot of fun to watch when on screen, giving the silly-but-likeable heroes a larger-than-life obstacle. Honestly I strongly recommend this movie if you like well-made movies that don't require any usage of the brain to enjoy; like, if you've had a long and frustrating day at work and you want to enjoy something explosive while simultaneously relaxing, Furious 7 more than does the job.

Statham is great in his limited screen time, and the script and characters are great but the director couldn't pull it together with tension and visual realism like Justin Lim somehow perfected with the 5th and 6th films. Even with all the crazy stunts and set pieces in those two films, if felt very thrilling and weirdly grounded. Some moments recreate that style to an extent, but other moments fall flat in visual unrealism. The final act/set-piece, while very stupid however, was pretty awesome though.

I knew this movie was going to be dumb - they've all been dumb up to this point - but most of the rest of them have been dumb in a fun way. Unfortunately this one really flirts with just being dumb in a dumb way. The plot makes very little sense when it's given an ounce of thought, and characters inexplicably trust others for no reason other than to keep things moving. The humor is more forced than usual, with characters rarely leaving their archetypes. This movie is filled with tropes and cliches, but this franchise is so influential that it's hard to tell if it's regurgitating these tropes or inventing them. Also, Dwayne Johnson is severely underutilized. All of that being said, of course it's still fun. It's got the fast cars and the stunts we're expecting. The movie is stuffed with easter eggs and inside jokes (cars don't fly!). The familial theme is there, although not as obvious as in the previous entries, and there are heartwarming moments.

However, the fun continues making it likeable and fun enough to watch. In here Jason Statham is brought as the villain who is obviously one dimensional but has a legitimate grievance. The send off of Paul Walker incredibly works well although some of the scenes look weird knowing he is not really there but the movie pays tribute to the tune of When I see you again specifically written for his passing. Finally the Rock continues to prove how badass he is in these movies despite a limited role in this one.",Furious 7,Furious 7 - Movie Reviews

333,Stephy S,"Oct 23, 2021","An overall improvement upon its predecessor. Frozen II is exactly what you'd want from a sequel, more songs, more charming character moments and interactions and some absolutely gorgeous animation! First off, with this being a musical, you got to have some good songs and Frozen II definitely doesn't lack in that department, with the highlights being Lost in the Woods, The Next Right Thing and Into the Unknown. The acting was also top-notch as you'd come to expect from the returning cast. Especially Kristen Bell and Jonathan Groff deliver on some exceptionally charming and delightful performances. But without a doubt, the biggest praise I can give this movie is the animation. Hot damn, It's truly something else. The water looks too real for an animated flick and the movement is just as great and fluent. The character designs are also very exquisite and distinct. Unfortunately, it isn't all sunshine and rainbows. Some characters are painfully underutilized. Kristoff gets kicked out of the story early on and doesn't get to do anything meaningful and the new additions to the ensemble of characters aren't used in any meaningful in creative ways. All of these characters seemed to have some great potential for fun and quirky character interactions and had some noteworthy chemistry. Finally, the world-building is hit or miss. They introduce some really cool concepts and themes into the universe but they feel a bit rushed and half-baked. Some of them could've been thought out a little better while others feel like they aren't properly explained to the audience. In short, Frozen II might not be a subversive and perfect sequel but it's still pretty solid. It's truly a miracle this movie still turned out so good considering the rushed and problematic production.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews
334,Jan B,"Oct 18, 2021","As we all know, Disney has completely taken over, especially when it comes to movies. Frozen 2, amongst the singing and dancing, deals with real issues, like growing up and finding your place, your purpose. Though it may be a little heavy for some younger kids, those who grew up watching the first frozen movie, like me, find a real message embedded in the plot and various popular songs. The songs are just one portion of how the movie is dealing with these issues, such as change. For example, the first song describes how some things will be the same no matter what happens. Things like family and friends and true love. However, as the movie progresses we can see that things change regardless of what we do, some quite ironically if I might add. In the first song they sing about how the flag will always fly, and as soon as the spirits wake up and show their wrath to the city, the flag is ripped from the flagpole with the wind. For characters like Anna, this is a hard realization that things are changing. In the same breath, as those things change, we figure out a way to handle the change for the better, and that not all change is bad. Another topic they deal with is growing up. The kids who watched the first movie when it came out, grew a whole 6 years before the second movie came out. For me, I was in high school and applying for college when the second movie came out. Growing up is a scary topic and it could evoke some unhappy feelings for younger kids, especially those who don't like change. Frozen 2 also implies some falsehood about growing up, ""When you're older, absolutely everything makes sense"", as adults, we know this statement doesn't ring very true. On the same note, as you grow and go through life, you can find your place in this world, your purpose, just like Elsa and Anna did. Elsa found her place in the enchanted forest as the fifth spirit, and Anna found her place as the queen of Arendelle, which is arguably where they both belong. Aside from the positives and negatives to Frozen 2, I honestly think it's a great movie. It is more suited for slightly older audiences, but the topics that this movie deals with are important, even the heavy ones. Everything changes eventually, everyone grows up, but growing up and changing isn't necessarily a bad thing. It can definitely be intimidating, but it does ring true that no matter what changes, things will be okay. In my opinion, that is a great message for kids who are scared of growing up and finding their place in the world, like I was.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews

352,Manuela B,"May 28, 2021","I want to speak about Frozen II. This film is directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, they had realized the first movie also. The mains characters are Elsa and Anna the voice respectively of Indiana Menzel and Kristen Bell. The movie was released on 2019 by Walt Disney Pictures. The film tells a story of two sisters who lost their parents during the first movie. Anna and Elsa lives in the Arendelle's castle, Elsa is the queen. After the death of their parents, Elsa heard a mysterious voice call out to her. So she left the castle and the citizens to follow this voice. Anna, her sister is stubborn as a mule, she follows Elsa during this adventure. Many things will happen Personally I love this plot, I find it entertaining, touching and also interesting. In Frozen , there are a lot of specials effects. Elsa has a power, she can built an ice house, frozen the way, make a snow. Her power is very captivating, and beauty. For exemple in Frozen I Elsa make a snowman for her sister. The movie is an animation, the draws are very well done. The characters to appears real. I saw the making of, and it is a very long work. The details are important, we can see the emotions, the feeling of the characters is interesting. For exemple when Elsa sing, there is a close up, we see the character's face , the profound emotion. I thinks the script is good. For exemple Olaf the snowman is hilarious, even if is a snowman, the characters is lovable. We can laugh when he makes a joke. I recommended this film,to anyone who loves the Disney animation. Seriously, when I see this film I can cry, laugh, have all emotions. Waltz Disney animation makes characters very captivating. Songs are choose with attention. Everybody know « let's it go » this song is moving. I'm full of admiration for Frozen. The animation is difficult, isn't easy. Waltz Disney makes a interesting job. I'm never be disappointed by Disney Animation. Really go to see this film because is incredible.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews

359,Jesse D,"May 05, 2021","7.0/10. Have you seen the first Frozen? If you have kids, like Disney films, or have a pulse, it's more than likely you answered yes. And given that yes is your answer, then you have already seen the better of the two films. While Frozen 2 is still a good film, especially for those with children to entertain, it doesn't reach the heights of it's predecessor in any appreciable anyway. The animation is as good as ever, the perfect voice cast from the original return, and this heroine-led story has action, laughs, and some meaningful moments. But so did the first Frozen, which did all of that, but better. While the narrative foundations for Frozen 2 are arguably stronger than the boiler-plate fairy-tale original, this film adds too many unimportant characters and slices the film into separate plots that aren't always engaging. The tear-jerker moments don't jerk as effectively and the soundtrack pales in comparison it's counterpart; it almost concedes the point when it uses motifs from the original on more than one occasion. That's not to say it does any of these things poorly - this movie has heart and a good soundtrack, but it stands in the shadow of one of Disney's biggest recent hits. Some things never change, including that Disney's freshest ideas are usually better than the retreads.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews
360,Dollores L,"Apr 24, 2021","I thought Frozen 2 was a whole lot better than the first one. In the first one it overall just made me frustrated at what they did and said. I wholeheartedly agree that the songs in the first movie are 100% better than the ones in the second (minus Olaf's solo). However, in the second the characters look way more mature. I was so surprised when I saw how good they actually looked. Yes, I know that looks aren't everything but I thought that that was something important that should be pointed out. In the second I didn't exactly understand the point they were trying to get across though. What really saved the movie, for me, and made it a whole lot better was Olaf. He is by far my favorite character and I am guessing most everyone else too. Olaf makes the most hilarious comments and his solo song made me and my whole family laugh. Not going to lie, without Olaf the movie would most likely be a dud. I liked the story line of trying to save the enchanted forest and it gave me some real Moana vibes. I thought all the element characters were well thought out and I especially had a soft spot for the adorable little fire lizard/gecko. My least favorite part of the movie is either during the opening song ""some things never change"" or when Christoph has his solo ""Lost in the woods"". I was cringing hard during both of these songs. The first one that I listed was extremely sappy and made me shudder multiple times during the song. As for ""Lost in the woods"" I thought it was the most cringy of all the songs. It looked like they were going for an old montage theme for that song. I actually went to get refills for my drink and popcorn during it because I was so unsettled. (the popcorn was delicious by the way 🍿) I thought the songs were all sung extremely well and they even had me singing along at some parts. (I don't think the others in the theater were impressed though) I wouldn't consider this a must watch to those who haven't even seen the first but if you have then you NEED to see this one too. By the end of the movie you will have had some good laughs and I honestly believe that it won't feel like a waste of time.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews

The writing is witty and handles all the characters differently but emotionally and mostly in a clever way, with stand out characters being Tony and Wanda but the real pinnacle of the film being Ultron. Much like the movie, the only reason he is not the best villain in marvel is cos we have so many great ones, because Ultron is a hilarious and threatening, well designed marvelous (see what i did there) mix of Tony, Bruce and Vision who has motives that line up with Iron Man's character leeding to real deep dives into the sea of his phyce. The story is mostly simple, with many well choreographed but somtimes boring fight scenes and lot's of exposition but you have to remember that it's introducing three new characters here AND trying to move development on for the Og's. The movie set's up further Marvel movies, like Civil War, and gives our heroes something internal to recon with while still leaving us asking questions that we know will be answered.

397,Cailan D,"Jul 20, 2021","Avengers: Age of Ultron unfortunately falls into the ""sequel is worse"" trap. The writing and directing lack the finesse that they had in the first Avengers and are both awkward at times. Ultron, though Spader gives a pretty good performance as him, isn't the greatest villain because it seems that he dislikes the Avengers for reasons that aren't personal to him. He attempts to come off as sort of a ""people person"" but ultimately fails to do so because of his goals and execution. The humor is decent but not as good as it is in other MCU installments and is hampered by the script. The biggest issue of Age of Ultron is that it's a very ambitious film and tries to do too much with its runtime. There are multiple stories going on so as to set up future movies and the movie would've done better with a more specific focus. All that said, the actors as usual do their best to overcome the script and are successful at doing so in many instances. The chemistry between them helps to carry scenes where other elements don't work as well. One highlight of this film is actually one of the low points of the first Avengers, being Clint Barton/Hawkeye. This movie treats him very differently than its predecessor and gives him more screen time and moments to shine. His speech to Wanda during the climatic battle is one of the best speeches in the entire MCU and his arc gives more depth to his character and leaves plenty of opportunities for future development and storytelling. The action sequences are entertaining enough and should keep viewers engaged for the full runtime. While Age of Ultron is far from the best the MCU has to offer, it has some redeeming qualities and is worth taking a look at.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,Avengers: Age of Ultron - Movie Reviews

However, with certain deaths revealed the true glorious purposes that those characters were burdened with. I saw some of them in different light, and it was very sad. The beginning started just a little bit slow, but after that, the movie became unrelentingly thrilling. Even though it's the shortest in runtime in the franchise, I was basically glued to the TV the entire time. I sensed so much urgency in Harry and could not be more invested in him and his allies. The ending did not disappoint and delivered plenty explosion, wizardry, and valor from the characters. Everyone united and faced the strong and desperate dark lord himself. It was glorious.

The one 1/2 down-grade I gave it was actually due to the final duel scene with Harry & Voldemort, right after Neville Longbottom kills Voldemort's snake, Nagini, with the Sword of Griffindor. The simple cracking of Voldemort's face and then scattering away in the wind in tiny pieces was a complete slap in the face to audiences that deserved a MUCH more intense demise after following this movie series for 10 years. Lets face it, if we started our kids on the first movie at age six, they would have been sixteen when the last installment was released. I'm fairly confident they could have handled a more severe send-off to one of the screen's most hated characters. Did anyone in the theater you attended applaud loudly and yell vocally when Voldemort was defeated. Our's was packed and not a peep from anyone when he was killed by Harry. There you have it.

This movie hardly competes with any other because of its circumstances where the somewhat flawed buildup was all shoved into a different movie entirely, leaving this one with the sole task of delivering a lengthy fan-service climax to the entire franchise with a practically unlimited budget and plenty of characters whose arcs were 95% finished. The plot revelations were the best part of the movie, followed by the special effects, then the acting prowess displayed by the leads (especially Fiennes and Bonham Carter in this one), then the dramatic and memorable film score. The most touching scene of the movie and perhaps the entire series for me was Hermione offering to go into the woods with Harry - it came off incredibly altruistic and human, hitting me right in the feels unexpectedly in a way that Snape's memories did not. There were some things I would've preferred to see happen with the characters than what did, though that's mainly a very minor gripe with the source material. This was extremely successful as an ending to the series and deserves its spot as the highest-rated movie in it, even if that's mostly for getting to adapt only the exciting parts of one of the novels.

If the previous three film (Order of Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince, and Deathly Hallows part 1) if these films were the resistance underground films, this one is the out and out war film with wall to wall action, separated by a few tender quieter moments in between. In the last stand battle of Hogwarts everybody showed their bravery. Dame Maggie Smith's Prof. Mcgonagall got a moment to show how badass she is taking over Hogwarts, and Neville Longbottom was one of the most courageous young wizards, standing up for the Dark Lord himself. He was so brave he earned the right to wield the Sward of Gryffindor and truly save the day. That said, the true sacrifice came from Snape, the most misunderstood hero of the story. He gave up his entire life and managed to live as an outcast for years just to protect Harry and fool the Dark Lord, he managed to have a final moment with Harry which just made me very emotional. The final showdown between Harry and Voldemort was short and sweet. The Dark Lord's hubris lead to his downfall after our heros managed to take him down piece by piece working together, and utilizing the Deathly Hallows for good not for personal gains. The film then was bookended with a happy scene at the train to Hogwarts 16 years later, with the new generation of wizards starting their first year at the school.

Does this film play heavily on your memories and nostalgia of a cinematic masterpiece? Absolutely. Is this a Hollywood blockbuster to entertain your kids and eat popcorn to? Most certainly. But beyond that, this is just poorly made. After finishing the film, I had to wrack my brain for hours to try to understand what I witnessed, and what it meant. And I've come to the conclusion that it is simply confused. Masterfully confused. It tries both to be everything at once and an intricately focus-tested action romp. It tries to be a skit comedy, an action-adventure, a space opera, a drama, a romance, and an action spectacle. And it fails on almost all counts. At very least it was entertaining. If you enjoy Star Wars, you'll see everything you want to see here. There are X-Wings, and blaster lasers; there are jedi and lightsabers; epic swordfights, big explosions, and more. It's quite fun if you don't take it seriously at all! But that's the inherent issue, isn't it? Star Wars isn't just some nonsense sci-fi romp; it's one of the biggest sci-fi epics in the entire genre's history.

It's a phrase for killing the past, deconstructing old beloved characters, having stupid plot twist for its own sake, having no respect for the old fans at all, pushing a political agenda and using a franchise to parading your own ego as a filmmaker. What Rian Johnson did here - as a filmmaker (not as a person), is unforgivable. Many fans watched Star Wars in their youth when they had troubled times - they looked up to the characters - especially to Luke Skywalker. It's not only a shallow action figure - it was a symbol of goodness and hope. ""The Last Jedi"" makes a bitter, cynid old grump of Luke - who cowardly nearly killed his defenseless nephew, left his friends and family alone and dies off alone in the end.

Considering that they didn't quite know where this story was heading to, I think Johnson did a fantastic job. The theme of failure being a lesson throughout the movie was really cool to see. It wasn't just blasters and action and everybody wins; it was much more layered than that. Luke being an irritable hermit to me was very fitting after what he went through. And on top of this was the intricate budding relationship with Rey and Ben Solo was great. It showed them both of having flaws and I think that's needed in the Star Wars Universe more. Both feel lost and hopeless and alone, but they realize they have a connection this way. Is it a healthy relationship? Not at all but I like that it showed the grey of their personalities inside such and black and white universe. Also, bringing back the puppet Yoda made me tear up in nostalgia.

The script doesn't help--at every possible opportunity, the story is forced to be some sort of swelling, dramatic, climax--strange, since it is hard to feel anything given how soulless it turns out to be.

Rian Johnson is on record of saying the best films are ones that half the audience likes and the other half hates. Mission accomplished. Though I'd say it was 10/90 like/hate. The film's story had no cohesive structure. It was more like multiple, unrelated subplots hewn together like a kindergarten level collage.

The Last Jedi breaks everything we know as a trilogy... and that's perfect. You just have no ideia of what to expect, because actually, everything can happen at anytime, and things really does happen. Director Rian Johnson knows what make a Star Wars movie and a great sci-fi epic, setting the bars pretty high for this one visually, technically and narratively, not just making it a love letter for the real fans, but putting it up there with The Empire Strikes Back in a kind of surprising manner, while also setting it apart from his older ""trilogy brother"" by the inventively corageous plot, the gorgeous presentation and the mind-blowing twists.",Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,Star Wars: The Last Jedi - Movie Reviews

The lack of world building is prevalent The most idealistic person in the galaxy was turned into a cynical and brooding hermit. The fact that the true escape plan is kept from Poe Damaren is infuriating. They kill off Snoke and Captain Phasma before any arc can be established. Their main character is so utterly forgettable. Instead of exploring Finn's background they turn him into a bumbling idiot. He could of been a scarred anti-hero with a dark past. By attempting to subvert the viewer's expectations the film makers subverted all the fun right out of the movie.

Also, the Holdo maneuver would have been more effective at the beginning of the chase, thus saving the rest of the vessels of the resistance. Also, where is the rest of the New Republic military.

Here are my reasons: - Memorable and well developed characters. - An original and well-executed story. - A soundtrack that was only surpassed! like photography, it's the best! The original essence of the first movies is back! and the CGI is great! It is very well worked, you can see the dedication with which it was made. - Finally, we cannot forget that we will open the doors for what is to come in 2022 in Jurassic World: Dominion!

509,huyqiwd s,"Jun 24, 2021",Okay this movie sucks. I'll start with everything I hate. The movie is really cheap and it starts off with with claire wanting to save the dinosaurs even though they should be extinct. She cries about it. The trailers are also annyoing they just showed every single good part of the movie to make you think it is going to be good. They showed all of jeff goldblums performance and they try to shove in so many dinosaurs. It has an allosaurus a carnotorus a baryonyx a synoceratops and of course they are going to make rexy kill off the bad guy at the end. It is too predictable but perhaps the worst thing about this movie is they keep copying the other ones and they do that to much. It is basically the lost world but in a more modern way. The plot twist about the clone girl is stupid the characters are stupid and all while this is going you have bad acting unnecessary scenes and overall a horrible plot. The first scene is the only good scene in the whole movie. I think the worst actor of all is bryce dallas howard chris pratt was okay I don't know why he is so good with this role but so bad when he plays stare lord in the mcu. Speaking of marvel the jurassic world movies have so many actors that have been in marvel movies for example chris pratt bryce dallas howard ty simpkons vincent d'nofrio sam neil jeff goldblum jake johnson but that's not really there fault.

This is hands down one of the best musicals Disney has created. This starts with the amazing work of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez who were the song composers for this film and Christophe Beck who was the score composer. The score wonderfully sets the backdrop and the songs are all memorable and work so well with the themes and character arcs. The casting is also perfect as all the main character voice actors have experience performing on Broadway. The work on the animation is also well done with great particle effects for the snow and noticeable improvements on human hair. I understand the oversaturation of this film in pop culture, however I fully believe it is well deserved.

The first part was released in 2013 and made a splash. 3 Speaking of the plot, it is quite heavy even for an adult, because even my parents were touched by the plot. The drawing itself is at a height, everything is very clear and every detail is drawn, which pleases the eyes. One of the most important things is that even though it is a cartoon, but all the emotions are perfectly conveyed and touch the soul. Thanks again to the smallest details, you can very well understand each character, well, except for Prince Hans( my most hated character). Of course, the cartoon has a sequel, this is its second part, but the first one will always remain in my heart. Although, I don't mind the third part) so ""Frozen"" is the best animated film I've ever seen.

It really differs from your average Disney movie as it isn't based on ""true love kiss"" and ""boys"" and ""I need a prince to rule."" The characters are hilarious and make you smile. But if you are watching with kids you will probably be hearing ""Let it go!"" for weeks on end. Even as a teenager now, my little sister puts it on and I sit with her and actually enjoy most of it.

570,Dale R,"Nov 15, 2021","A live action remake of the 1991 animated film of the same name. There are some big names in this film: Emma Watson as Belle, Dan Stevens as Beast, Luke Evans as Gaston, Josh Gad as LeFou, Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, Ian McKellen as Cogsworth, etc. They all do a great job with what they are given, except for the music. With the exception of ""Gaston"", all the songs in this film feel unemotional and over processed. Some of this, I feel, is due to the fact that there is limited musical theater experience with the actors chosen for this film. Ewan McGreagor is good, but he can't hold a candle (pun intended) to Jerry Orbach's many years of musical acting experience. The CGI for the Beast's face was lacking and I'm sure it hid a great facial performance from Stevens. There were a couple of scenes where Watson felt like a stick saying, or singing, lines. The added material didn't feel necessary to the story, though some of the plot holes from the original film were plugged. Nostalgia fueled the success of this film and maybe that will be enough for you to enjoy it as well.",Beauty and the Beast,Beauty and the Beast - Movie Reviews

589,Urainia S,"Jun 07, 2021","I really love the moral behind ""Beauty and the Beast"", and it's the only Disney romance which still gets me. It's an important lesson about the ideas behind the curse of Beauty. In my mythological soup, this stands for The Judgment of Paris, where Aphrodite was chosen as the fairest (Athena DID NOT like this) because of her ability to provide a beautiful wife for the shepherd prince. The Beast becomes a Beast in mind because he has objectified his kingdom through beauty. Beast is a stand-in for Mercury, and/or Dionysus, and that's why the beautiful Athena-like witch shows up in ugly drag to test his hospitality. When he turns the witch away based on exterior appearances, not recognizing the beauty of her wisdom, she curses his kingdom to be physical objects until Beauty reappears. Then it's up to Beauty to reverse the curse through her wisdom, by seeing past the objectification of the Beast as a horrible animal to locked up in a mansion with his material things. It's important here that Belle is the hero. The Beast can't fix himself, he's the victim, and only someone who reads books and doesn't just stare at the covers can put it all together before the rose loses her last petal...",Beauty and the Beast,Beauty and the Beast - Movie Reviews

Best parts of the movie were indeed the raccoon, Jack-Jack, and scenes with Edna Mode. During the latter parts of the movie, I literally just wanted it to end. Three years (2015-2018) of waiting for this movie, walked out extremely disappointed. Watched it for the second time last night, no, just an absolute no. I understand the animation was smoother. But certain scenes were ""cut"" too sharply. The ending of Edna Mode's scene was abrupt, cant quite describe it. If you watch it at that point, you'll understand. So sad. There was so much potential.

627,Jacob R,"Jul 03, 2021","Ok, so this movie is pretty good, and has all the good stuff from the original movie, but it has a few too many problems that prevent it from being as good as the first movie. First, all the things that I thought were basically spectacular. All the stuff that involves them actually being superheros is really good, not better then what was in the first, but still really good. Next is the animation, which feels very different then all the others. This feels like it's stylized for the 1950s, which the film takes place. Some people can find that distracting, but I didn't. Also, all the new characters are either good or funny, except for one thing, but I'll save that for a little later. Now, let's talk about all the things that this movie just didn't do well enough in, which keeps it from being as good as the original. The main thing is really the characters that are brought back. Except for Elastagirl, Frozone, and Jack-Jack, all the old characters feel significant weaker. I don't want to say this, but the worse character in this movie by far is Mr Incredible. He is either acting completely crazy, completely mean or ignorant, or is not really blaming himself for everything that is going wrong with the family. I'm sorry, that's a huge problem that you can't fix with just one scene. Violet and Dash seem weaker too, but I was able to look past them. I, however, cannot look past Mr Incredible. Also, another big problem is the stupid twist villain. I know Pixar has done them before, but only one of them was actually bad (Miles Axelrod from Cars 2 ring a bell for anyone?). That is…until the Screenslaver shows up. This was the first time I was able actually to predict the twist villain in a Pixar movie, which made it super boring. It's also really hard when the last villain in this franchise, Syndrome, is the best Pixar villain ever. So, with all of that said, I still think this a good film that everyone should watch. All the superhero stuff (besides the villain), is still spectacular, you're just gonna have to sit through a bunch of the family stuff that isn't as strong. I think that's the biggest difference between this movie and the original. ""The Incredibles"" is a family and character study first, and a superhero movie second. ""Incredibles 2"", however, is a superhero film first, and a family film second. If you don't mind the change, then you'll think this movie is great! If not, like me, you'll only think the movie is pretty good, almost great. But hey, why listen to me? Go to Disney+ and watch this almost ""Incredible"" movie!",Incredibles 2,Incredibles 2 - Movie Reviews

But anyway, that's just a minor inconvenience. I hope that's the only problem I have with this movie, other than probably the fact that it's nowhere as memorable as the first movie. While The Incredibles is something of a pop culture icon this movie is, well, let's just say we'd have never learnt about it if it wasn't advertised so much. Incredibles 2 starts off from the part where the prequel left. And it finally answers the question of what happened in the fight between the Parr family and the Moleman - It... Happened. The only thing that came out of it was that Violet's BF learnt about her identity, which was later wiped out (or so I remember, I don't even think this movie was memorable enough. I'm remembering all the scenes as I'm writing this). So now Helen is out on another adventure, leaving Bob with the kids. And he's terrible at handling them. It was a very funny scene, seeing him struggle everyday trying to help Dash with his homework and Jack Jack in changing his diapers. The family moves into a new home which is way better than their previous one. Dash and Violet discover Bob's car and they bring it home. Then something something Helen finds out the guy who she's working with has a sister who is her costume designer, and she's secretly evil. And now it's up to the kids to save the day with all the superpowers and plot armours. See this is exactly the problem of this movie. It is super predictable, although that's not a bad thing since the way those scenes are executed make it very satisfactory to watch. The animation of this movie is probably the best thing about it. It is one of the only things which has improved drastically since the first movie. The Incredibles, you might remember, was very cool. But I just wrote a review of it yesterday and it was then that I realised the quality of that movie has aged terribly. In terms of polygon count this one takes the win. However, I also mentioned in that review that the thing which makes The Incredibles so much fun to watch is that it feels like a videogame, something similar to Sonic the Hedgehog or Spider-Man for PS4. That's not something I could say about this movie. Incredibles 2 isn't one of the movies Pixar is known for making. It's something of a sequel that can only satisfy you that the fight in the end of the first movie didn't end on a suspenseful note. It is a one-time watch for the fans of the first movie, although the kids might like it since the movie seemed to be more oriented towards them.",Incredibles 2,Incredibles 2 - Movie Reviews
632,Jerry S,"Jun 17, 2021","(SPOILERS) Honestly I am almost tempted to say I like Incredibles 2 better that the original. The characters are great as always and there is some real character development the music is spot on and I really enjoyed the moments between Bob and his kids and the awesome action sequences between Helen her self. I honestly have a blast watching this sequel, however the only problem that I have with this movie is the villain Evilen Deavor. On the one hand her character is really great. She and her brother Winston Deavor have interesting and intense back stories and have good moments with each other, however the movie kinda drags just a tad because there really trying to hide the fact that one of them is the main villain. Another thing is that Evilen's plan can kinda get confusing at times. However that doesn't mean that it takes away from the movie itself though. There is this seen with the Screen Slayer a villain that Evilen herself created and has some of coolest moments in the movie. However going into that seen though there are flashing lights so you have been warned. That scene was pretty thrilling and even haunting. However the best action scene in the entire movie was the opening which was just straight awesome and so satisfying.

Of course it's not the original but it took a well known story and added onto it perfectly. I enjoy how it focused on Elastagirl and really showed how before becoming a house wife she was a force to be reckoned with. I think the villain was very unique and there was a good twist added in.

659,Jean L,"Jul 09, 2021","The Fate of the Furious continues the downhill spiral of mediocrity that is the fast and furious franchise. Once a fairly ok but fun series of movies about street racing and fighting organized crime has now become a multi million dollar franchise about extraordinary heist crime action that defies the laws of physics, stupid characters, plot devices that make no sense, and just simple stupidity. Previous movies are fun enough to watch including this one but it does not make it good. In this one Dominic Toretto played by Vin Diesel betrays his team of street racers turned into international crime fighters with nice cars. The story is completely ludicrous although it tries to make some sense but in the end is just dumb. The villain played by Charlize Teron is badass and formidable as Teron brings her incredible presence that she carries into every movie yet the character motives are questionable and flat out cartoony. The only fun thing here is The Rocks and Jason Stahams chemistry which is hilarious and great which led to the spin off Hobbs and Shaw. Otherwise the rest is a bunch of explosions and impossible action pieces in a movie universe that is supposed to be realistic and is now trying to mimic superhero movies. This franchise is losing steam.",The Fate of the Furious,The Fate of the Furious - Movie Reviews

That's the dumbest thing to have in a FF movie. Rewatch this before seeing F9 tomorrow. Not gonna bother talking about the story, cliche dialogues, villain that only say stuff slowly and slam the keyboard, or family stuff, because that is just a vehicle for the movie to exist, so that they can lay waste to as many cars as possible. It is important that after watching too many movies, you just gotta turn your brain off and enjoy a dumb movie. And the later installments of this franchise is just what I need. Watching so many cars getting destroyed and blown up was crazy fun. The best scene was for sure the remote car control scene. It was ridiculous in all the entertaining way. Dwayne as Hobbs and Jason as Shaw were great as usual. I like both of them, and Dwayne displaying his alpha body was just great.

The first part of the movie was enjoyable and fun, but Gary Gray tends to drag it a little too much towards the end. It is obvious what was gonna happen and, honestly, I expected more fireworks and CGI magic.

I watched the extended edition of this film, which in my opinion was perfect (you can rent it for the same price on Amazon). The humor and action were really good in this movie, and I loved some of the twists and turns in this movie. While it could've been generic, as suggested by some of the trailers, this movie constantly stays unique IMO. While it is VERY over-the-top, it didn't feel nearly as stupid (in a bad way) as the last one.

Paul Walker's absence is felt throughout, but thankfully this isn't a major plot point and doesn't hold the film back from having fun. I appreciated that the writers took this film in a slightly (really very slightly) different direction by having some betrayal within the group. Dwayne Johnson finally feels utilized in this entry with far more screen time and humor than in predecessors. The physics in this one are outrageously unbelievable as always, but the stunts and set pieces are impressive. I was hesitant about Shaw's redemption arc at first, but it proved to be quite satisfying and effective.

Some people complain Tony is not in a suit enough and sure, but isn't that kind of the point?

703,Nathan D,"Sep 05, 2021","Iron Man 3 was such a joy to watch as there were so many great moments throughout the film. The script is solid and doesn't shy away from any aspects, which leads to a great viewing experience. The main villain of the movie is rooted, and his motives are clear. Is he the best villain? No, but he gets the job done. The character arcs in this film are so much better here than in the second installment. Tony grew as a person and was able to become a better person overall. If I had to nitpick the script, I think I would have toned down the political tones a bit. It began to be a lot at times which I think was unnecessary. Another thing was that it felt a bit predictable at times. Using the shady businessman for the third time in a row does get a bit repetitive. Shane Black does a stellar job directing this installment and is on par with Favreau's work on the first film. There were plenty of scenes that felt inventive and unique, making the film have very few dull moments. Even with the more serious scenes, it still had the emotion it needed to be entertaining. To accompany Black's directing is some solid cinematography from John Toll. There are a lot of shots that look very nice and have some significant elements to them. Sadly, those two aspects get brought down by the harsh editing in the film. The action sequences have too many cuts leaving the scenes to feel rushed and messy. There are even a few scenes where some cuts don't match up with the shot before. The score does make up for this as it keeps the energy up in some of the scenes. Composer Brian Tyler created this bombastic score that impacted the film profoundly. The production and set design are also very attractively done. Many visually appealing locations complimented Shane Black's vision quite nicely. The cast also does a fabulous job here with stand-outs all around. Like always, Robert Downey Jr. shines on screen. This performance is the most human he has felt in any of the three Iron Man movies as he and Black translated what was on the script to the screen very nicely. Gwyneth Paltrow continues to do great in the role of Pepper Potts. Although, her performance in Iron Man 2 is still the best out of the three movies. Ben Kingsley is outstanding here and created a lot of entertaining moments in the film. I can see why some people do not like his performance, but I thought he was a lot of fun. Guy Pearce is also a solid addition to the cast. His acting seems bland at times, and it does not help that his character is somewhat the same as the other two films in the franchise. Supporting cast members like Ty Simpkins, Rebecca Hall, and Don Cheadle are fantastic in the movie. Overall, Iron Man 3 is an action-packed blockbuster that is so enjoyable to watch. The film does have a few blemishes in the script and editing department. Yet, the entertainment factor helps hide it at times. An exceptional cast, an outstanding score, and marvelous directing make Iron Man 3 a stand-out film in Marvel's cinema catalog.

The villain is generic and forgettable, and the twist is rather insulting, especially to hardcore fans. The suit that makes Iron Man who he is comes off nigh-indestructible in every other Marvel film, now the thing just flies to pieces if he gets hit just a little too hard? And he spends less than a quarter of the movie in it. Wow, how inspiring. I get that they were trying to go for 'Iron Man is the MAN, not the armour', but it just falls apart.

709,Ethan T,"Aug 25, 2021","Iron Man 3 is an average popcorn superhero film saved by Downey Jr. in the lead role. His smarmy yet lovable Iron Man is always a sight to behold. The action alternates between a decent showcase of big-budget CGI and illogical messiness. Paltrow and Downey work well together and Don Cheadle and Paul Bettany (voice) seem to have fun. Simpkins is a rare likable child star, but the positives end there for the supporting cast. Guy Pearce brings all of the campiness and not much else for a villain. Ben Kingsley is very welcome in another villainous role but does little to justify his inclusion apart from a bit of hit and miss comic relief. The comic relief in general does not completely miss, but could be stronger and telegraphs much of its humour in advance. Rebecca Hall did alright, though it's another case of her not quite bedding into admittedly daft proceedings as with Transcendence.

But, someone did make a good point about Marvel making all of the villains in witty comedy pieces. It happened with Loki in ""Loki"" and ""Thor Ragnarok"", Zemo in ""The Falcon and The Winter Soldier"" and The Mandarine in ""Iron Man 3"". It isn't really the best ideas to make people who tried to kill everyone on the Earth best friends with the main characters. Robert Downey Jr. always puts out his best as Tony Stark. The Ironman franchise is one of my favorite trilogies in cinema history. I'm sad his story is over, but I am so happy about his character arc throughout the MCU.

732,Christian K,"Aug 19, 2021","Honestly it's difficult to choose which is the most deranged film I've seen this week, Being John Malkovich or Minions. Minions does feature a 'hypno-hat' which enables the wearer to hypnotise whoever is in front of them and take control of what they're doing. So there is a slight link between the two films there. I've only seen the first two Despicable Me films (2010/2013) and they're pretty decent; nothing groundbreaking but a nice idea played out well. Minions is arguably the most inevitable spin off movie in film history, and unsurprisingly there's a sequel due next year. The sensible route seemed to be using the film to tell a minion origin story, and the opening sequence that explains the minions route through the earth's timeline is good fun, telling us how they've always wanted to serve some terrible evil master. We know where the film will probably end, and sure enough, it does, but it's produced well enough to hold the attention span of children and adults alike, even pre-schoolers will preoccupied for ninety minutes (mine certainly was). It's also absolutely bonkers, and I think to make this work the producers had to double down on the madness (or double up if you will) which is exactly what they have done. A lot of it is set in London, and there's plenty of shots of people drinking tea, as well as an extended cameo from an animated Queen Elizabeth II. But I understand that this description might not sound anywhere near as insane as a Charlie Kauffman film.",Minions,Minions - Movie Reviews
733,Puroo R,"Aug 09, 2021","I had watched Despicable Me just to understand the memes and to get within the lines of the pop culture. I never understood the deal with the Facebook memes which have pictures of Minions in them and have quotes written next to them. So I used to think Minions always speak out funny one liners for the audience to have a quick laugh at. After watching Despicable Me I realised this was nothing but cheap publicity, but then I decided to watch the whole franchise anyway, and so here we are. After having watched the original trilogy, this one feels a step back, but that doesn't mean it isn't entertaining enough. Minions is a spin-off to the Despicable Me franchise (the name of the franchise is Despicable Me or Minions, I will never know). This tells the story of how the Minions found Gru and became his, well, minions. In the beginning the Minions were only wild animals who used to serve whoever was evil. They move on from one master to another, until they have none left. And that's when three Minions set out on an adventure - Bob, Kevin and Stuart (isn't it funny that they have English names even though they were born before humans existed?). The franchise has a really good animation style. It looks cute enough to be memorable, especially seeing the Minions take part in activities in the things they see for the first time. Even the action scenes of these movies are incredible. Scarlet Overkill being shown as a total badass and then getting her comeuppance made this movie so much fun to watch. Queen Elizabeth's mockery was also very funny, especially the part where one of the Minions tries to pull the sword out of the stone. The ending with Gru was also very unexpected and gave the movie a happy (?) ending. What this movie lacks in, however, is the storytelling. This is not a good movie, but rather a good ""enough"" movie. There's nothing in this which you haven't seen before. The plot is mostly predictable, many parts are very annoying to watch, especially Scarlet being a generic female villain who always wins with martial arts. Other than Queen Elizabeth and Herb there weren't any memorable characters. Herb was memorable and still I forgot his name. Minions is one of those movies I can imagine kids going crazy over, since the movie is targeted only for them. If you're an adult you will find this movie very childish. It's not like the Despicable Me trilogy which is fun for the whole family. It has just selected all the things which made the franchise marketable and went all out in showing them here, namely, Minions.",Minions,Minions - Movie Reviews

There are non-meaningful fights, like Bucky vs Black Panther, or even the airport scene in this film. But the final fight here between Cap & Iron Man is a meaningful fight—and simply sad, especially as Baron Zemo watches from a distance with pleasure. I'd much rather see villains fight against each other (Doctor Doom vs Magneto vs Ultron vs Loki vs Thanos vs Carnage, anyone?). What was cool was introducing Spider-Man and Black Panther, and going deeper into Vision & Wanda's relationship. The plot was generally fine (even if you were semi-familiar with the comics version of the plot) but the circumstances causing the final fight seemed contrived.

I really enjoyed this in Age of Ultron, and to SOME degree here, but the talking here seems artificial to promote the highlight of this film where each side poses before fighting the other side. The disagreement over the Sokovia Accords seemed just dumb, and both Tony and Steve seemed like they were on the flip side of where they should be. Really? Tony is going to not go save someone when a bureaucrat in Belgium tells him not to? I get character growth and guilt and all, but please.

That makes the movie almost impartial, which was a super-intelligent idea because everybody could be a villain. The action sequences are spectacular and the introduction to new characters added to the development of existent and returning ones are perfect. Tom Holland (Peter Parker/Spider-Man) and Chadwick Boseman (King T'Challa/Black Panther) are two of the best characters of this universe.

Pretty great cast with Patrick Wilson, Amber Heard, Dolph Lundgren, Willem Dafoe and Nicole Kidman. Probably ranks up there with Black Panther for most colourful movies.

Though the acting isn't great by any means, and the story is kind of generic, Aquaman is selling what is literally says on the tin; a bro-ish superhero, with fish-powers, must save the World from his evil brother, whose powers are similar to his. Aquaman isn't my favourite character by far in the cinematic universe, but he does stay true to his portrayal in the comics, unkempt and brooding with a few quips here and there. I liked him far more in a solo film than I did in Justice League, as it seemed too many of the team had similar attributes and he just didn't stand out. Black Manta, being one of my favourite comic book villains, was also excellently portrayed by Yahya Abdul-Manteen II. Aquaman works better than the previous films because it doesn't need a lot of exposition and time to get to the root of the story.",Aquaman,Aquaman - Movie Reviews

Luscious visuals, incredible special effects world, great supporting cast including Oscar winners Kidman and Defoe with many stellar performances. Biggest drawback was the female lead did not have the chops to keep up with Momoa nor the chemistry to hold the position of female lead and love interest! She was barely tolerable and that God-awful red wig... At least director Wan did not have her use a hideous British accent like in the Snyder cut of Justice League. Her poor acting and general vibe left a bad taste in otherwise great movies. But I digress, this is an Aquaman review. Aquaman is an over the top character that is bigger than life. Momoa takes a character that was made fun of for many years and makes him cool. He makes this superhero someone you want to hang out with, without needing to use his powers. Wan did a nice job showing Curry's early life and showed how he became the person we are following now. Long live Aquaman!

845,Cailan D,"Aug 06, 2021","Aquaman is one of my favorite films from James Wan and shows that the director is capable of handling multiple genres. Aquaman may not be the best movie we've seen in the DCEU, but it's by far the most fun and entertaining and has the most rewatch value. The visuals are phenomenal, the fight sequences are fantastic and the premise is pretty good too. The acting supplements all this really well; all the big actors do great jobs with their roles and Jason Momoa is a surprisingly good casting choice for Arthur Curry. This movie is a solid origin story for Aquaman that I only wish we'd had before the Justice League disaster so we could've had context for character upon seeing him in a big group setting, although the movie does play off of Curry's appearance in Justice League nicely. Patrick Wilson is a very welcome face in this movie for me and fans of the Insidious and Conjuring franchises and marks his 5th collaboration (I believe) with Wan. Wilson shows how good of an actor he is in this movie. I appreciate how this movie made good use of all it's big-name and A-list actors; it didn't squander any of them and gave an actor we haven't seen too much of before the film the spotlight a few times. I do wanna reiterate a point I made earlier now about the movie being fun. Aquaman struck a very different tone and mood than pretty much every other film in the DCEU; the other movies have been very serious or comedic, but haven't been so in ways that make them truly entertaining. Aquaman has a very different vibe from the rest of the DCEU, and it's a breath of fresh air. Aquaman wants to be a fun movie and succeeds in doing so, and it's a movie I could watch 5 or more times and still be entertained by, a luxury I don't personally have with any other film in the DCEU. All that said, Aquaman isn't a perfect movie, and it's biggest fault for me is the dialogue. It's really cheesy, cringey and corny at times and without the great performances from the actors some scenes would be really awkward, stupid and unwatchable. Some the actors, especially Patrick Wilson, have to be on their A-game to keep a straight face while they say their lines due to how ridiculous the dialogue is at times. Honestly, if the dialogue had been better, this movie probably would've been a perfect 10 for me since everything else about the movie works really well; the dialogue is something I hope they work on and refine in the sequel, which according to Wan started filming recently. Overall, Aquaman may not be perfect or the best movie in the DCEU but it's a fun, entertaining and action-packed movie and has some of the best rewatch value of the whole DCEU.",Aquaman,Aquaman - Movie Reviews

The infamous Minas Tirith battle scene, the heroics at the Black Gate, Arogorn's speech, the brotherhood between Legolas and Gimli, the corruption of Frodo by the Ring... it's just cinematic perfection and there may never be a movie series to rival LOTR, particularly not in the fantasy genre.

It adapts by far the worst source material of the three and really pays the price for it with one of the worst cases of deus ex machina in movie history (the ghosts); the director thankfully chose to excise the worst chapter of writing Tolkien ever produced, that being the Hobbits returning to the Shire to find that Saruman has taken it over, but a lot of the buildup to Frodo's eventual character-ruining refusal to destroy the ring was internal and wasn't conveyed in the movie. We are instead left with a protagonist (who had already become worthless halfway through the second movie) making a heel turn long after all respect for him had been lost. I think a few of the Oscar wins this received was based on accrued appreciation for the trilogy as a whole and a lack of significant competition in '03.

884,Puroo R,"Jun 22, 2021","This is my third and final review of the trilogy. In the first movie's review I called it an RPG game and mentioned on how the world building was done adn how great the visuals were. In the second review I said it was like watching a book come to life and talked about the character development and philosophy/message the movie gave. In this third review I have called it an art and here I will talk about the story and why it will be remembered not just as a masterpiece, but also as a legacy. Keep in mind that all the reviews have been written separately but all of them imply to all three movies. The Lord of the Rings is one long story that has been divided equally among three movies. Because of this there is virtually no major difference between the them, and all the three movies have received almost the same ratings. Normally in trilogies the stories do not directly pick up from where the last one left but rather these are three different stories, because of which it is possible to have two great movies and one movie which does not live up to them (Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, Christopher Nolan's Batman, the original Star Wars trilogy, Godfather etc), or there is one great movie while the other two don't live up to that (Zack Snyder's Superman, Star Wars prequel and sequel trilogies, Jurassic Park etc). Here the risk was much bigger. Since there is just one story, either the entire trilogy would have been good or the entire trilogy would have been bad. This is why the movies were so long. The story is set in a fantasy world and not everyone has read the original books by JRR Tolkien. So Peter Jackson had to elaborate every minor detail. There should have been no questions left. The audience should've had a clear idea of what they were watching. Normally such things are only possible in TV shows which are book adaptations like Game of Thrones or The Man in the High Castle since they have enough time in their hands to explain everything. This, however, was a movie series. This is the reason why the runtime is so long. The total runtime of the trilogy is 10+ hours, and 12+ hours if you watch the extended cut. Another major problem that could have plagued this movie, if it wasn't addressed, was the number of characters and the fact that all of them were in different places doing different things. There were some minor characters right in the beginning of the story and some in the middle. All of them had to be humanised, something which is possible only if we get to know more about them. Because of this the story is moved forward such that we are made to care about all of the people. While we ask what happened to Gimli and Legolas in the battle, we are also worried that Frodo has been tricked by Gollum and is about to be eaten by a giant spider. The direction does not shift in the bias of any of the characters, otherwise the ones the audience cares about would have been left behind. People often make fun of the half-hour long epilogue shown in the end of The Return of the King, but imagine if it was not there. So many characters would have received vague endings. This was meant to assure that all the good characters got good endings and the bad guys got bad endings. I'd also take a moment to talk about Gimli and Legolas' relation. In the beginning they both hated each other but later on they grow to become friends. This is another great message that the movie sends us. In my previous review of philosophy I didn't mention it because it was seen in this movie. It talks about how we hate some people based on their appearance, their beliefs, their way of life. But we end up becoming friends with those same people once we actually interact with them. People were never meant to hate each other. This is something we are taught to do. This is also seen when Aragorn unleases the Army of the Dead. They never wanted to work with the living because of their hatred, but when one of them came forward and made the request, they gave in. It is these small moments that show the humanity in all the characters. And finally, what makes it a legacy? Today everyone knows about The Lord of the Rings. Gandalf is the first thing someone imagines when they hear the word ""wizard"", in spite of there being a more popular book adaptation movie franchise which is literally about wizards. So many RPG games have their stories set in the manner of ""some characters with different abilities go out on a dangerous yet exotic adventure"". Elijah Wood has become world famous for his role as Frodo Baggins. Gollum, in spite of being the same annoying character found in all fantasy movies, is more popular than Jar Jar or Dobby. All of this is possible because of the way the story unfolds. Everyone who was evil was simply so because of the circumstances, and those who were good were because of how much the story emphasised on their actions. This coupled with great direction and a good world building made it so popular. The Lord of the Rings is one of the era defining movies of our times. It looks like a painting brought to life, one that we used to look at in fairy tales and nursery rhymes. It is the first thing that comes to someone's mind when they think of a fantasy adventure set in the medieval era. The patience of the creators and the fans is what made this trilogy so powerful. I really hope we get to see more such adaptations of books that we haven't heard about. This one has made a benchmark that will be hard to reach in the near future unless a miracle happens.",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - Movie Reviews
885,Big Mojo W,"Jun 09, 2021","Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is the best ending imaginable to this incredible trilogy. The characters continue to shine, most notably Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf and Aragorn in this movie. With the Battle of Helm's Deep won and Saruman dead, the stage is set for the final battle in this epic saga. Upon finding that Sauron plans to strike the city of Minas Tirith, the heart of Gondor, Gandalf and Pippin ride to the city only to find Denethor, a madman in control of the city who is totally unfit to be the Steward. Eventually, the forces of Gondor, Rohan, Eriador and Mordor all coincide at Minas Tirith for the largest and in my opinion, best battle not only in this saga, but in all of cinematic history. Every scene in this movie holds weight to it, it is my favourite in the trilogy and seeing Aragorn finally take his place becoming King of the Reunited Kingdom always brings a tear to my black heart. This movie, like every other in the trilogy is flawless and I will rewatch these movies until the day I die.",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - Movie Reviews
886,Will C,"Jun 06, 2021",(Extended edition) I've always found this the weakest of the trilogy and it is also by far the worst of the extended editions. This suffers much more than The Two Towers from pointless additional scenes that add nothing to the film other than to bog down an already exceptionally long runtime. There's very few additions that I think make the film any better.

I had certain expectations and I suppose Homecoming helped me know what to expect from its sequel. With that in mind I really had a good time with this film. Its a fun small neighborhood film with a really good villain. They nailed Mysterio in the film. I loved how they portrayed his character and I loved his costume. I was surprised just how close they got to the comics with it. I am glad the days of trying to subdue or gritt-ify superhero costumes are somewhat over (still holding out for Wolverine to get his comic book costume). Ideas of certain superheroes are kind of goofy and so are the costumes. It's part of the fun. Certainly adapt so it doesn't look super goofy but don't destroy either. Overall I would recommend giving it a watch. Holland still isn't my ideal Spiderman, nor is his world, but I enjoy it for what it is. And I am so glad they got rid of Spiderman's AI voice.

The humor is still good enough, the action is done well, and Holland continues to play his role marvelously.

901,Felix L,"Nov 16, 2021","I have a lot to say. I am a huge Spider Fan a Huge MCU fan. The number of people that know Peter Secret identity is Outrageously high so it doesn't feel like watching a spider man story. The Whole Teenage movie Recipe Cliché. The Character Dialogue try to copy the one from the early marvel Iron man movie.. and fail because they have nothing to say to each other. The Teacher is the best part of the movie. The pitch meeting for this movie should have been very differently .. You think Peter can go back to a normal life after the event of Infinity War.. I know marvel wants to Elongate the story but darn it felt wrong. You know from the beginning who Misterio is.. So nothing is a surprise .. Kinda dum that Sony want to make a Misterio movie since sooo long. He's really not an interesting character. At least he was well played. Again to many love scene and goofy scene. We will we ever have a spider man movie without love scene that never ends ..i rather watch a 45 minute movie that is good than 2h movie that just pointless boring story with multiple plot hole just to insert character that you really don't care about. Fake Fury team look like the Nebucad Nezar team from Matrix and they are super Cringe .. Movie is dull make no sense . Do you really think the Skrull can be this Dum. Its like if Peter did not learn anything from all his adventure in the past few years. He has 0 sense of responsibility . Homecoming was the best Spiderman movie.. why did it turn this way Why did Peter gave Edith to Misterio ,,, And the END with J Jonas Alex Jones Jameson is simply ridiculous it made me lost all interest in the continuity because we all know what comes next.. Just like in the Infinity Saga (2012-13) in the comics. that will keep going on with dr strange / Happy Plus Aunt may = Cringe I seem to be alone to think that this was a bad representation of who Peter Parker is. But i own 9000+ comic book and I'm not living in USA so what do i know This is my least favorite MCU movie and i am serious. I gave one star for acting and cast because it was a good cast . and another star for the score BGM and FX.

917,Rafael R,"Oct 30, 2021","Compared to this movie, Spider-Man: Homecoming is on another level. Far From Home is in general a decent film, but the two most important parts are bad-written: the protagonist and the villain. Tom Holland's Peter Parker involuted, becoming an idiot teenager who wants to run away from his responsibilities to conquer the girl he likes. Where is the guy who wants to prove himself? The guy who wants to be more than the neighbourhood friend? And Mysterio's plan and motivations don't make any sense. Luckily, he's imposing and Jake Gyllenhall is a stunning actor. The humour is more basic and less intelligent, but almost as efficient as Homecoming. And what elevates the level of this film is the third act, which is for sure one of the best acts in the whole MCU. The visual effects are amazing (by the way, the movie plays with them smartly) and the final fight is MCU's best individual fight (only one hero against the villain). Tom Holland and Zendaya's romance may seem forced, but it makes sense, they have chemistry and fortunately, the script kept MJ's cynical personality. No other character but Peter has been distorted.

979,Stefan Z,"Nov 11, 2021","Ah yes The Dark Knight one that turns into Home Alone. It's got a sprinkle of mission impossible too, but it's more known for being The Dark Knight that turns into Home Alone. All the The Dark Knight stuff are great. I am a huge Batman fan and absolutely hate Joker especially his oversaturation in the DC universe, but in this he actually works as the main villain. The score, directing, and cinematography are all fantastic. Deakins did unnecessarily use yellow more than need, but fantastic otherwise. It's when the film turns into Home Alone that I have trouble suspending my disbelief. Silva exposed all double-0 agents, but 007 because he was presumed dead, But MI6 have only 9 field agents? Where are the single-0s? If there were ever a time bond would NEED to work with someone else it would at the Skyfall property. Some snipers in the off distance trees, some in the house, another in the DB5 (that unfortunately was destroyed... again. I hate when movies think it's ok to destroy timeless cars). Some other times in other Bond movies I think ""maybe this would have been better with another double-0 by his side, perhaps not"". In this one I'm thinking ""bring in the cavalry"". Yes, I get it, they can't trust anyone especially how M's bodyguard of 15 years tried to kill her in Quantum of Solace, but then why trust Bond? He was presumed dead for how long, not know how much he's changed or feels betrayed still about her practically shooting him and doesn't know how much Silva's word affected him AND even acknowledges how little she knows if Bond is being influenced by Silva by abruptly feeling the need to stop and explain her actions involving Silva. I am also not really a fan of the film constantly asking the audience if the franchise is relevant, particularly M's scenes in the courts. Every single EON productions James Bond film, all 25 of them, have made money, even with new actors in the protagonist role where customers are not used to the new shoes yet, those sometimes make even more than the last one of the previous actor. Skyfall itself grossed over a billion dollars in 2012. So to answer the redundant question, yes, it's relevant. There also are some weird plot holes involving Silva. How exactly did he know the train was going to come through the wall when it did or how did he plan to kill M years in advance when the hearing was only set up 3 days beforehand. However, this and Casino Royale (2006) are the only Bond films where James gets character development, so that is a plus. I'm torn. Not a fan of those to particular writing things, the Home Alone part being a bigger deal for me really, but man, even though I spent like a sentence or two on the positives, they do really boost up the overall quality. The cold open, the fight against the sniper in the skyscraper, and the subway (tube) foot chase are some of the best action set pieces in Hollywood history. The tense gripping atmosphere of the mystery behind who is is hacking in MI6 before the villain is revealed is absolutely expert filmmaking. I do really think the positives outweigh the negatives here.",Skyfall,Skyfall - Movie Reviews

993,Nathan D,"Oct 10, 2021","Skyfall is an incredible movie with many astonishing aspects that make this film feel like a genuine spy thriller. Sam Mendes does a magnificent job directing this movie, as he creates this obscure yet exciting tone throughout the whole screen duration. The solid script helps support Mendes' vision with a prominent central story. Skyfall nailed down the story perfectly, as this is the first Daniel Craig Bond movie to feel like the world of a spy. Both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace struggled to capture the elements of a James Bond. However, the screenwriters perfected it here in this movie. Having the central storyline being an attack on MI6 while mixing in some of the personal elements of the characters is excellent for this franchise. Where the script falls flat was the misuse of the Bond girl. The poor treatment of Sévérine is very noticeable throughout the film and makes Skyfall suffer significantly. It is not necessarily wrong to not have a Bond girl, but to have one and completely butcher her character arc is wrong. Skyfall is visually stunning, with the exquisite cinematography stealing the spotlight at times. Roger Deakins does an extraordinary job here as the director of photography. Many shots were remarkable and captured the worldbuilding exquisitely. The editing is also the most potent of the first three installments. There are a few scenes with slightly choppy editing, but it is not as detrimental as the first two films. The score is also very compelling as it elevates a lot of the scenes. Thomas Newman knows how and when to make the music match sonically with what is on screen. The cast of Skyfall is strong, with a lot of great performances all around. Daniel Craig is smooth and has a lot of fun quips that make this movie special. While he may be exceptional in the role, his performance in Casino Royale edges his performance here just by a bit. Javier Bardem is phenomenal in this film and had the best performance out of everyone. The emotion Bardem put into creating Silva was comprehensive, and Bardem never overacts in any of his scenes. Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw are both prominent in their respective roles. They each stand out in all the sequences their characters are present in. Lastly, there is Judi Dench, who knocks it out of the park. It is Dench's most excellent performance in all the Bond films, as we really get to spend time with the character and not just see her tell people to eliminate the enemies. Dench still keeps that aspect alive in her performance, as it is an influential aspect of M's character arc. However, it never becomes too over-the-top. Skyfall is the complete embodiment of James Bond as the film holds every aspect a spy thriller needs to be a great film. The story is easy to follow yet has this slight complexity to it that still makes it shocking. The cast is perfect, with no bad actors bringing down the film. What does bring down the film is a messy subplot that looms its gloomy shadow over the film. If it were not for that terrible treatment of Sévérine, the film would have been perfect.

She was charming and fun. I loved them both in Knives Out. It appeared Craig was enjoying this segment as much as I. I personally don't think any Bond movie should end like this and I actually regretted watching this outing.

1005,Lequisha S,"Oct 05, 2021","The Dark Knight of the Craig Bond films. Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins offer by far the best cinematography for a Bond film. You like that shot of the burning city in 1917? They got you covered with Bond's family estate. You like that shot in Shang-Chi of them fighting against the backdrop of neon advertisement billboard? They got you covered. Like the meditative wide shots of the landscapes in 2049? Oh do they have you covered in Macau. Like Adele? Covered. This film challenges Bond in a way no other film has. He's weary, battered, and no longer as fit for superspy espionage as he was in his earlier years. But the one woman who has been a constant in his hectic life, his boss and surrogate mother figure, and the person who gave the ""take-the-shot"" order than made Bond end up in the drink, Judi Dench's M is at risk. The best bond villain to date, Javier Bardem's Anderson Silva, is not trying to take over the world. He's got a personal vendetta against the one person Bond has any real attachment to. What's more, he's a dark mirror to Bond. A former 00 and M's previous favorite, Silva was the Bond before Bond who also suffered from ""mother's"" decision to prioritize the mission over the agent. He's not only a formidable foe for Bond, but he's an effective foil. This is also the best fusion of the modern, gritty, grounded Bond and the gadget-laden, seductive, classy elements of early Bond. It pays homage to hallmarks of the olden days (Moneypenny, Q, etc.) yet breaks new ground (we visit Bond's home, we change M's, etc.) This is truly prestige bond.

Skyfall brings the stakes higher as everything seems to be collapsing hence the title. In here Daniel Craig continues to shine as James Bond and here is directly paired with Judy Dench as M as M16 is attacked by a powerful villain. The chemistry between the two is wonderful almost as a mother and son relationship and Craig faces his most challenging antagonist until this point Silva played by academy award winner and spanish actor Javier Bardem. Bardem kills this performance and brings a similar aurora to that he brought to No Country for Old Men. Bardem is psychotic, mild mannered, and out for revenge in one of his most iconic roles. Lots of great action here as always but is the drama between the characters and the great relationship between M and Bond that makes this movie so incredible to watch with a climax that keeps on the edge. With Adele singing in the intro, great direction by Mendez, a great script, and an incredible performance by Javier this movie is almost a masterpiece.",Skyfall,Skyfall - Movie Reviews

1020,Puroo R,"Aug 08, 2021","Looking at the poster and trailer of this movie I was thinking this might be something really good. I had recently watched the first three movies of this franchise and I really liked the whole concept of Transformers; just seeing them do something on the big screen is enough to get my attention. So when I heard that this is the worst movie of the franchise, the robot dinosaur poster refused to let me believe that. How can a movie with such a good CGI possibly be bad? And when I watched it... I now apologise to all those people I didn't trust. I'm really sorry. The problem with this movie is that it has humans. I know, Transformers are all about Autobots and humans interacting and coming together to beat Decepticons, but the humans in this movie are terrible. I forgave Dark of the Moon since it was Sam Witwicky, the same guy we had previously seen in two prequels. But this time, it's the new guy. I don't even remember his name, so let's just call him Mark Wahlberg. Mark is such a two dimensional character. He loves mechanical engineering and hates anyone approaching his daughter. Yes, that's his entire personality. So when Optimus Prime ends up coming to his lab, they bond together. The premise of this movie is all wrong. The Autobots are now considered criminal in this world because of the destruction that happened in the previous movie. Like, what? Dude, even the army was doing destruction in the previous movie if that's supposed to be a real reason. Also everyone saw the Autobots fight the Decepticons in the epic climax moment. And it's not like there's some communication gap between the Autobots and the humans, since Optimus Prime literally lived with the military. So if there's any problem at all, they can just talk about it. So anyway Optimus helps Mark, his daughter and her boyfriend escape from there, and they team up with Hound and some other Transformers (I don't even remember the names at this point, because they don't give a reason to do so). Together they go to The Lost World where Optimus fights the robot T-Rex for which I watched this movie in the first place. First of all, the T-Rex is like, five times bigger than Optimus Prime. For comparison, just try fighting an elephant with your bare hands (except that elephants are herbivores and won't attack you unprovoked). And after the beating that T-Rex becomes friends with Optimus because it's a Michael Bay movie. So then there's the epic showdown battle between Mark and some bad guys. I was doing my college project on my laptop and this movie was running on my phone's Prime Video, so I used to only look at the movie whenever something interesting would be happening, otherwise I'd just keep doing my work. I don't think I looked at the screen more than 3-4 times throughout the work. This is the reason why I can guarantee you that it's a boring movie. I don't remember most of it. Transformers: Age of Extinction is the movie that taught me that Transformers could be bad too. Earlier I used to see Screen Rant articles which said that after a time the movies went repetitive with the CGI fighting and explosions, so I didn't understand what's bad about it since that's literally what I watch them for. But it turns out the reason why I hate it is the other way round. The big, cool robots have now turned into parodies of themselves and the humans are no longer even close to being interesting. I'd say if you haven't begun watching this franchise, just watch the first three and then jump straight to Bumblebee. That would save a lot of time and inner peace.",Transformers: Age of Extinction,Transformers: Age of Extinction - Movie Reviews

The new Transformers are fun as well, whether it be the snarky Crosshairs, the serious Drift, or the violence loving Hound. This movie is a new start, and a good one at that.

The score once again is very amazing. It makes a good moment into a nearly perfect moment. The story is not complicated and if anything its too basic. The action like every Transformers movie is GREAT. It also is probably the most kid friendly Transformers movie out of all of them. This or TLK. The humans aside from Cade are pretty bland and just, ""Eh."" Lockdown is great though. He might be better than Megatron. He is very powerful and pretty cool looking. Some of the shots in this movie are insane. But another problem is how long this movie is. I feel like it could have been done in a one hour and forty five minutes movie. Like every other Transformers movie its pretty stupid. The dinobots were pretty cool. but they could have come sooner. Lockdowns ship is very cool. Crosshairs, Drift, and Hound are all ok additions to the cast. They kill off an important Transformer in the beginning which sucked. It helps show how powerful Lockdown is though. This movie is like a cake. You eat it and it tastes pretty good. You think to yourself that you would it the cake again in like half a year. You do and it tastes just as good.

1060,Jeff B,"Oct 29, 2021","Jeff Barnes 8/28/21 The Dark Knight Rises Review The Dark Knight Rises enables you to be absorbed while watching it with: symbolism advising you to pay attention, intrigue, a moral that teaches us persistence. Batman in The Dark Knight Rises plans to save Gotham City from a terrorist named Bane with the help of Catwoman. Catwoman is perhaps the most captivating character in the picture. Catwoman is a thief, but she believes she's being a thief for a good reason. She tells Bruce Wayne that she, like Robin Hood, steals from the rich to give to the poor. She is so full of mystery we wonder why does she feel like she must steal to get what she wants? I's probably because she enjoys being sneaky and manipulative. She does it because she sees a lot of fun in it. Catwoman believes you should take what you see because you only live once, and that you should seize the moment. Catwoman is an insecure woman who's not sure if she wants good or evil in the world. There is a scene in the film where Catwoman a/k/a Selina Kyle sees a picture of a family and realizes that the place that has been demolished and spoiled was someone's home, and her friend Holly says ""now it's everyone's home. This is what you wanted a storm is coming."" Selina then looks dismayed and unassured as if she seems to be comprehending that maybe evil isn't as pleasant as it seems. One of the most powerful moments in The Dark Knight Rises if not the most powerful moment is when there are an army of policeman running towards an army of criminals shooting at each other, and this represents a war between law and crime. The Dark Knight Rises like the previous Christopher Nolan Batman films has a main theme and it's persistence. The occasions that most notably represent persistence is when Bruce Wayne is thrown in exile when he's thrown into a pit where men suffer, and he's determined to get out. Wayne realizes that climbing out of the pit takes persistence because he figures out that only one person made it out. He also grasps that he and Batman have a whole lot of endurance as well more than you can imagine. He's still willing to climb out of the pit despite only one person having done it successfully. Before Wayne successfully climbs out of the hole, he sees Bats coming out of the walls and this symbolizes that he truly is Batman. The film that shows that Batman is willing to have so much persistence that he's willing to be selfless by risking his life to save others at the end. Christopher Nolan brings a satisfying conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy with: persistence, theme, morals, symbolism, and intrigue.",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews

1069,ggavwva a,"Sep 30, 2021","Sep 21, 2021 This review contains spoilers. the filmmaking in The Dark Knight Rises is nothing short of masterful, and stands above the other two in the franchise, especially from a cinematography, production design, and art direction standpoint. Not to say ‘Begins' and especially ‘Knight' were lacking, because they were crafted to astoundment, but ‘Rises' just took it a step further, especially with the sound, and the fact that it didn't get nominated for either sound mixing or editing is a straight up insult to the film, and goes to show The Academy was only concerned with the politics of the shooting that year rather than the merit of the actual film, which was fantastical. On a technical level, it's **** amazing. It deserved a cinematography, production design, SCORE, sound editing, and sound mixing, and visual effects nomination and there's no **** denying that. The production design and art direction were more layered and complex than the past few films. The cinematography did seem a bit more modest than ‘Knight"" but it still succeeded at giving us some haunting and memorable images and composition that really fit the more somber and hopeless tone of the film, instead of the fiery orange and blues that bolded the presence of chaos in ‘Knight"". The score may have taken track basis' from Begins, but it restated them and added much more variety and emotional power and timing to the film. The sound design isn't even an argument, and while the visual effects were actually pretty minimal for the part of a lot of them being practical, that still should've given it enough to grasp a nomination over ugly bland CGI **** like The Avengers and that Hunstman movie. I mean come **** on, those two movies have some of the ugliest color palettes and uninspired VFX I've ever seen. In a less competitive year, it easily could have gained a supporting actor nomination for Michael Caine, because he added a whole extra layer of emotional depth to the film with his performance, and boy he really got it out in those few scenes. it gave me a feeling I haven't really felt in any other movie, bringing tears to my eye. And no, he wasn't not in it enough. Check Hal Holbrook for Into the Wild. He was in that movie for a very short time, but gave enough of a performance to get a nomination. Same type of deal. With very similar roles, actually. Despite being the best, most relevant, and most well made film of the year, and even one of the best of the decade, Adapted Screenplay, Picture, and Director were extremely unfavorable for the simple fact that the Academy can't see past ""Batman"" and because it wasn't getting anything more than its predecessor did. I can go on and on and analyze all the relevant and subtle political themes and philosophical depth that is beautifully mixed in with honest and emotionally resonating heroism, postmodern ambivalence, and themes of pain, corruption, and personal crisis and struggle, but it's not that important to this topic. People are too busy nitpicking **** that doesn't even matter (and can easily be debunked) anyway. The fact of the matter to this question is that it was ungratefully and unreasonably snubbed from the technical categories simply for the fact of the Aurora shooting. There is no other answer. The Academy didn't want to glorify a film that ""represented"" such a tragedy. The Dark Knight Rises is one of the most gritty and beautiful films ever made, and from a technical standpoint, it is one of the absolute greatest next to its predecessor. It deserved at least 2 or 3 nominations for sure at the very least. **** the Academy for putting politics over actual filmmaking merit.

The movie is exemplary in its use of editing and sound, they complement each sequence in the film perfectly and set the atmosphere for the film. Tom Hardy is almost unrecognisable as Bane. I believe it was a great performance. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman is a complete scene stealer and the dynamic scenes between Christian Bale's Batman and her Catwoman are well done.

1075,Hhhh V,"Sep 01, 2021","Where to begin. It starts out with an absolute bang. Another movie to the trilogy, another extremely badass, villain of the century introduced. Bane is intimidating, ruthless, badass, a myth; everything a great villain should be: pure evil. We immediately are hooked to the story that continues unraveling through the next parts of the movie. We get to see yet another deep and dark interpretation of Bruce Wayne/The Batman. Once again, Christopher Nolan flawlessly executes the complexity of the character and gives us so much more than just that. We see Wayne using his fears, his pain, his suffering to overcome those very things and rise above. We see our beloved Alfred giving his all to what can only be described as his father-son relationship with Bruce. We see new characters appear for the first time, such as the talented burglar, Catwoman, who also gets a very deep character and personality behind the mask. We get to see a mere cop, who gives his city his all, and risks his very life for the great good, representing a symbol of pure goodness. Not a single moment throughout this movie that makes you feel bored or not entertained. It's filled with amazing CGI; next level story-telling; suspense to keep you at your toes; character development that makes you connect to them in a way you never have before. You can literally feel the pain Bruce is going through, you can literally feel his journey to overcoming it.

1077,Janjz Z,"Aug 29, 2021","Aug 21, 2021 i just rewatched this film for the first time in a few years and boy was it much better than i remembered. this film offers a new look at gotham compared to the dark, gritty criminal underworld present in the first two films. we can see a gotham that has prospered in the last few years, moving out of the darkness both figuratively and literally. most of the scenes in this movie are set in broad daylight, which is a refreshing change from the last two entries. tom hardy is excellent as Bane in this movie. he is the first villain in this series that truly feels like an unstoppable force. the moment where the whole plan comes together, the cops are trapped underground and bane declares anarchy on the football field was chilling and was the first time i felt as though there were real stakes from a villain. i do find miranda tate being the true villain an excellent twist. she is Bruce's reckoning, a cultivation of everything he has done and him quite literally facing his past dealings with the league of shadows and the consequences of his never ending work to protect gotham. i do wish they'd built up her relationship with bruce a bit more, though, as their romance did seem to come out of nowhere, but in the end it made the twist even more jaw dropping. this movie is long, and there is a LOT going on, but for the most part the pacing is pretty good. there were definitely parts that could've been cut out, this film suffers from agonisingly long and boring car chases like the dark knight does. other than that there isn't much i would change about this movie. anne hathaway is also spectacular in this movie and was very enjoyable to watch. i found myself enjoying every scene she was in and we get to see her grow from the selfish to the selfless across the movie. this movie also features great performances all round. out of the main ensemble i can't say there are any weak performances. my favourite scenes would have to be the ones of bruce in the pit. he is quite literally reborn there and the harrowing chants of the prisoners as someone attempts to climb is something that i always remembered from the first time i watched this movie. this movie excels at being the end of the trilogy - batman's final mission. with the highest stakes ever, and one of the most impressive villains i have ever seen in a superhero movie, it's an enjoyment to watch from start to finish. And in the final scene where we see the plane fly off with the bomb and batman inside it we are quite literally seeing the death of batman. bruce may still be alive but he has hung up the cape, and the batman died along with the bomb leaving a beautiful well-wrapped ending to one of the best trilogies of all time. i don't see much point making more batman movies after these ones, they are hard to flaw are greatly celebrated even today. afflecks batman wasnt great, but he still feels like he stands in the shadow of Bale, which i also worry will happen to Pattinson once ""The Batman"" releases. after rewatching the remarkable ending to a franchise it has got me thinking about how future movies can compete, and in my opinions batman should be left to rest for now. the dark knight rises is the perfect fulfilling ending to batman and his story",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews
1078,Vghh H,"Aug 26, 2021","Aug 21, 2021 Not only is this the most intelligent Nolan film, really getting you to work as you watch the villain's plan unfold before you and the heroes, but it is also the most powerful in storytelling and moving the audience. Already you have the groundwork laid out from the previous film 'The Dark Knight' to follow up with Batman, running from the police who now has to tackle a new threat. It could not be done in a more mind-shattering and brilliant way. Bane's character, while seemingly a bit generic, quickly makes you realize how much you've taken him for granted when learning more about his backstory. Every time he walks on the screen he has a presence. I would say the same for the Joker, but he's been unfortunately memed too much for me to take him 'so serious' anymore. The way in which Bruce must rise again from the pit truly felt inspiring, and how he climbed out without the rope, the safety which he had always throughout the previous films. To me, that rope was symbolic of everyone he had with him throughout the films. Alfred, Rachel, and Dent as well. Now he had lost them all to the very same symbol which he crawls back to every night. He still finds the courage to put it on one last time. This time especially, I felt extremely interested in all other subplots in the movie. Gone was the fun but slightly stale 2000s grain and the lower mm cameras. This really plays up the aesthetic which Gotham is, and also allows for Gotham City to feel breathed in, as though people are really walking through it. This is something I never truly feel in any other Batman series or adaptation. To say this is the best Batman movie is an understatement. This really is the peak of Nolan's filmmaking for me. Everything from the acting, choreography, the score, and much more is such a step up from both predecessors. It never ceases to amaze me how much effort must have gone into this film.

This is going to be like a combo of my review of the movie and just my general thoughts on the trilogy as a whole but in both regards it deserves nothing but the highest praise. Such a brilliant display of everything from audio-visual work to narrative structure and characterization this trilogy really does it all. The score was absolutely outstanding from beginning to end and in this movie I felt like the score did so much to amplify all of the scenes regardless of what was happening. The dialogue was amazing, iconic one liners and more subtle conversations that carry so much emotional weight it doesnt feel like a single line is wasted at any point which is extremely difficult to do. The cast is so well done, can we just talk about how this one trilogy has some of the best protagonists antagonists and side characters in all of fiction? Every character arc was explored and developed to its fullest from beginning to the end, characters that are introduced in one movie get the proper amount of development necessary to flesh out every aspect and ultimately creates some of the most iconic performances in all of media. This movie had that in spades, in particular it had a lot of really good development for Commissioner Gordon who was already one of my favorite characters in the trilogy but this cemented it for me. My favorite character in this movie in particular was Catwoman for sure, she served as a super interesting counterbalance for Batman acting as sort of a more self-serving out for herself version of him and god damn was it fun to watch. Amazing performance Anne Hathaway absolutely killed it, its honestly kinda nuts how well she fit the role imo. Bane was another really interesting character, had some great dialogue, and his characterization was really well done. I think one of the main themes of this trilogy is the idea of chaos and how it brings out the worst in people, and Bane is a fantastic device used to explore this idea. I think The Joker was the better device through which this was explored but like I think thats being a little bit unfair so its whatever, both are fantastic in their own rights. Also this ending might be one of the best most conclusive most satisfying endings to anything that I have ever watched or read, everything fit perfectly into place, I just wanted to see my boy Bruce happy and thats exactly what we got, the ending had me straight up crying it was so good. I came to become so invested in these characters over the course of these movies and it feels so good to see this trilogy end in such a beautiful way. This trilogy is absolutely goated in every way, shape and form, Christopher Nolan is a genius.,I'm not even mad that we didn't get any more it's absolutely perfect. Truly one of the best universes in all of media, I honestly don't even know what else to say other than the fact that its brilliant The Dark Knight Rises: 9.5/10 Goated, absolutely fucking goated. This is going to be like a combo of my review of the movie and just my general thoughts on the trilogy as a whole but in both regards it deserves nothing but the highest praise. Such a brilliant display of everything from audio-visual work to narrative structure and characterization this trilogy really does it all. The score was absolutely outstanding from beginning to end and in this movie I felt like the score did so much to amplify all of the scenes regardless of what was happening. The dialogue was amazing, iconic one liners and more subtle conversations that carry so much emotional weight it doesnt feel like a single line is wasted at any point which is extremely difficult to do. The cast is so well done, can we just talk about how this one trilogy has some of the best protagonists antagonists and side characters in all of fiction? Every character arc was explored and developed to its fullest from beginning to the end, characters that are introduced in one movie get the proper amount of development necessary to flesh out every aspect and ultimately creates some of the most iconic performances in all of media.

1083,Jim T,"Aug 18, 2021","There's a lot of good in this film still. But it has neither as strong of a plot as Batman Begins or the stupendous fun of the Dark Knight. The climax is well done, but leaves unanswered still the question of whether Gotham can truly be saved, undermining the final product. Batman rides off into the sunset, but it is unclear that he has actually changed the city much for good - it still appears that it is only the same small group of individuals in the city who care for the city's character - not what Bruce Wayne took the mantle of Batman to do. Sure, he beats the bad guys in this battle, but he leaves the war while it's still being fought.

1086,Vhbg H,"Aug 13, 2021","Aug 9, 2021 Now this is how you close off an epic trilogy successfully! The Dark Knight Rises is the third and concluding chapter to Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, and is what I consider to be, a grand fitting end to the Christian Bale Batman/Bruce Wayne story arc. Released in 2012 to tremendous box office and critical reception, The Dark Knight Rises managed to become the highest grossing Batman film of all time, surpassing the hefty financial gain of The Dark Knight (2008), and still bares that title to this day. The Dark Knight Rises also has a few criticisms drawn from fans and critics alike, despite its mainly universal appraisal. Luckily for me, I'm not one of these hateful naysayers that hold any vice against this film. Drawing inspiration from various Batman comics storylines, such as ""Knightfall,"" ""No Man's Land,"" and ""The Dark Knight Returns,"" The Dark Knight Rises manages to convey an engaging and effectively entertaining plot that's jampacked with numerous allusions, homages, colossal themes, and most importantly, a gratifying and emotionally powerful conclusion. Christopher Nolan really outdid himself with this production. Not only do we get a phenomenal plot, but we get phenomenal choreographed action sequences and intense visuals. The special effects alone are a treat to the eyes!! Christian Bale is remarkable in his final performance as Bruce Wayne, bringing us a battle-hardened, broken hero who must rise past his broken spirit (and broken physical limitations thanks to Bane and previous fights) in order to save Gotham City from total nuclear destruction. Familiar faces aiding him such as characters portrayed by Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman bring their A-game in their final roles also. Newcomer Joseph Gordon Levitt does great as cop John Blake. And Marion Cotillard delivers an alluring, mystifying dual-identity role as Miranda Tate/Talia Al Ghul. But it's fellow newcomers Tom Hardy and Anne Hathaway that really stand out. The Bane we get in this movie is a lot different than the remedial one we get in Batman And Robin (1997); this new one portrayed greatly by Tom Hardy feels almost ripped straight from the comic books: an intelligent mountain of a man, who poses as both a physical and intellectual threat to Batman. Behind Heath Ledgers groundbreaking performance of The Joker, he's my favorite Batman villain in Nolan's trilogy. Anne Hathaway portrays Selina Kyle/Catwoman, a professional cat burglar, grifter, and femme fatale who develops a relationship with Bruce Wayne/Batman. She manages to evoke the sense of who Catwoman really is, and does such a great performance, she rivals Michelle Pfeifer's take on the character in Tim Burton's Batman Returns (1992). Lest we forget the intricate and meticulously well-shot 70mm IMAX cinematography? Or Han Zimmer's delightfully haunting musical score? Or every sliver of a detail perfectly synchronised to make connection and reference to the entire trilogy as a whole? No, lest us not forget. I still choose The Dark Knight as my favorite of Nolan's brilliant Dark Knight Trilogy, as well as my favorite comic book adapted film of all time; but The Dark Knight Rises will blow you away regardless",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews

The symbolism of the ending ends the trilogy off perfectly.",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews
1089,Ghhh b,"Aug 09, 2021","The dark moral of a corrupt political climate that The Dark Knight Rises shows through Gotham's grief is really excellent when the perspective is put on the issue. With Bane's ever lasting commitment to pulling off pain in the city, and Miranda's morality with her revenge it sets off a never ending stream for the tone of the film to follow along. Then Bruce wanting to be his own nation ""per say"" and do it without the willingness of others around him. Focusing on the complexities of the film is what I loved during this rewatch. Half of the dark blend of Nolan's direction and the surrounding technicals are what send this film off another level. With each of his films he keeps that dark tone and hits a nerve on the edge of your seat with every picture he makes. With each shot he focuses his time on making it make sense and capturing the message and/or symbolism of the scene. I don't really talk about it that much because it never turned to conversation but honestly the greatest scene in this film is the Star Spangled Banner Scene. The symbolism of that is so impressive. Your honestly watching one of the most messed up scenes in the history of Cinema. By using that song in the angelic voice of that young child symboled the freedom Gotham felt, but we as an audience no good and well it's not. And the feel of the scene is so damn intense. I always notice that it's only the kid singing, noticing that nothing else is happening except the anthem of freedom being used as the last thing to be heard before that feeling of freedom is stripped away entirely. Bane then going on to say ""that's a lovely, lovely voice"" knowing good and well he's about to kill that symbol of freedom singing the anthem of freedom. After that scene the third act takes off and the film gets nothing but brilliant. The technical blend as well deals with the more explosive side of visual effects. They go so well with the film it's hard to take your eyes off. The character of Bane has to be the best part about this film. Not only is he so **** misused in other DC properties and gets his rightful spotlight, but Tom Hardy's ability to make such an evil character and use that flow of darkness that Bane is so viscously proves that Christopher Nolan can be a director to take risk, and that arc of doing all of this for Miranda was pretty much a great twist. And I'd just say I recognize the hate that Miranda gets for her twist of being the head mastermind and not Bane, but I honestly think that the writers so greatly used their minds to convincingly show why she was the one behind it. Overall, The Dark Knight Rises should go in the all time books, and be shown as a way to tell a unique perspective on political corruption.",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews
1090,Jsnna S,"Aug 05, 2021","The casting is still great. The gravitas of Oldman Caine and Freeman just add so much weight and levity to characters which could not have been anything special. Tom Hardy is excellent as Bane and I love the way they shoot scenes to make Hardy seem larger then he actually is. He is almost the representation of pure evil and is the definition of intimidating. His famous 'I will break you' line from Batman Knightfall in 1993 has lived on to one of my favourite comic series and I love the soft adaptation that it gets. Selina Kyle contributed to some of my development in this movie in the same way that Carrie Fisher as slave Leia contributed too many children's development. Marion Cotillard is good as Tate but probably the weakest actor as she gets really cheesy towards the end. It's ironic as she is one of the better actors as a whole but doesn't always bring it for this movie. The most underrated performance though comes at the hand of the main actor and Bale knocks it out of the park again. Probably his best performance in any of these movies. The action is easily the best in any of the Dark Knight trilogy. Its funny ironically however as it means that Catwoman has some of the best action. The jewel in the crown though is Batman vs Bane in the sewers which is so cool. Speaking of which this is one of those extremely quotable movies due to Bane. My favourite is easily 'oh you think darkness is your ally, but you merely adopted the dark. I was born in it Moulded by it, I didn't see the light until I was a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding'. This all combines to make one of my favourite scenes when Batman escapes the pit and as a detail I love the bats coming out just before he jumps. Very rich plot. Its my favourite type of plot as if you are barely focusing on it you still get everything that happens but if you really focus you pick up every minute detail and I love those sorts of plots so much. The cameos also really surprise me as I didn't expect Scarecrow to rock up the first time I watched it. It's also miraculously well directed. Nolans over the city shots alongside his practical work, work wonders to create a realistic but also extravagant movie. His cinematography is also fantastic. It also continues the trend in his films to sometimes not have a concrete ending and in my opinion that works better. 10/10 I have no faults.",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews

1095,haley W,4d ago,"The film, the Joker, is about Arthur Fleck. For a living, Arthur works as a clown who deals with mental illness. He lives in Gotham City with his elderly mother and must take care of her. Arthur is constantly mistreated by society which is present throughout the film. When his social worker tells him he won't be able to get his medication anymore because the government is shutting them down to save money, this creates a major impact on Author and other citizens in Gotham who deal with mental health problems. This film has caused controversy because some believe it could give people ideas of mass shootings. The movie did not motivate mass shootings. It also did very well in theaters and many people, even if they don't know anything about DC Comics, really enjoyed the film. The Joker also had a very successful box-office run and won awards. The twists and surprises in this movie make it worthwhile and will have the audience on the edge of their seats. The opening scene of the Joker sets a dark tone for the rest of the movie. It shows how society treats people like Arthur and makes the viewer feel bad for him. Joaquin Phoenix who plays Arthur, was an incredible choice for this role. Joaquin's movements, emotions, and laugh really made the viewers sympathize with him as well as really helped the Joker come to life. The card Arthur must give to those who are confused why he is laughing is significant. This was a great way to introduce Joker's iconic laugh to the audience and to the citizens of Gotham city. A significant action Arthur does in the beginning of the movie is using his fingers to make himself smile while in clown make up. The reason this is important is because he is putting on a mask to make it seem like he is happy but, on the inside, he is struggling. Later it shows Arthur in his apartment with all his medication he has to take which makes him feel like he is just going through the emotions. The first subway scene shows how Arthur is being picked on because of his mental illness by laughing in a serious situation. This causes Arthur to make a rash decision and causes an uprising. The director Todd Philips did an amazing job picking the cast members. Each scene was important to this story as it went on. The close ups and zoom-ins, like Arthur sitting on the train after getting told he will be on the Bill Murray show, show how important and make you focus on that detail. After, Arthur goes to the Arkham Asylum, one of the many important parts in the movie. In this scene Arthur realizes about his past and what his mother, Peggy, went through. This scene is also huge because mental illness is a big issue in society today and makes people realize how big of an impact it can have on people. When Arthur leaves the Arkham Asylum you begin to piece together the hallucination he had with his neighbor. This begins to make viewers question what parts were hallucinations and what parts were really happening? The music in that scene is a great choice. The soundtrack to the film all fits together and was picked very well. This film is also interesting because unlike most movies about the Joker he is always battling Batman. But in this it takes place before Batman is Batman. It gives an insight into why the Joker became a villain and shows at one point he was a member of society, following the rules of Gotham. Another scene that was created well was when Arthur starts to transform into the Joker, by dying his hair and putting on clown makeup. Another scene is when he is dancing down the staircase. This scene is powerful because he is in his suit, clown makeup, and green hair. The music for this scene pulls it all together, it was a great choice and his dancing to the music is perfect. This is also showing his transformation from Arthur into the Joker. The scene on the subway when everyone is wearing a joker mask is powerful. This helps Arthur escape from the police, and it shows people turning on the police as well. The riot in the subway helps the cause of Arthur. The slow motion of him walking away from the subway while police run into the subway shows how confident Arthur has become and how much more confident, he is becoming. When Arthur is being pulled out of the cop car by fellow rioters and is placed on the hood of the car is symbolic. This is symbolic because there are citizens of Gotham who believe Arthur is right about the way Gotham is being run, which ties into his later encounters with Bruce Wayne. When Arthur uses his own blood to put a smile on his face and the crowd cheers, is the point when Arthur is no longer in control and the Joker has now taken over. The song ‘That's Life' is a great fit for this movie, which is played a few times throughout. It represents how even though society has not been kind to Arthur or others like Author, he still persevered through it and is taking actions into his own hands. On a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the highest score, I would rate this movie a 10. This movie can relate to issues in society today and is a realistic portrayal, unlike a lot of villain movies. It was directed incredibly well, and each scene is important to understanding the character arc the main character goes through. It also brings up mental illness which is an incredibly big issue today. Although Arthur's mental illness is very extreme, it still sheds light on how impactful it is on people. The background music in all the scenes match perfectly with the characters' attitude and show the seriousness of each situation. This really helps show how Arthur transformed into Joker and even when he wasn't telling you still understood the emotions he was feeling. It also shows how little Gotham did for the poor and mentally ill citizens. Todd Philips did a great job with bringing his idea to life and making people empathize with Arthur Fleck.",Joker,Joker - Movie Reviews

إقتباس من جملة نطقها الجوكر على لسانه في فيلم The Dark Knight والتي تمزج بين الرغبة في الشعور بالشفقة تجاهه وبين تبرير أفعاله التدميرية في مدينة جوثام، أما شخصية أرثر المهرج والتي عرفت بأسم جوكر في النصف الثاني من فيلم Joker من تأليف وإخراج Todd Phillips كانت الكاشف الأول عن العالم الحقيقي للجوكر والمبرر المنطقي لخلق شخصيته في أي مكان وزمان مماثل إلى العالم الذي أجبر أرثر على محاولة العيش فيه طويلا مع والدته داخل مدينة جوثام، وذلك من خلال مشهد وراء الآخر وبسبب هذا البناء التراتبي للشخصية يمكن تفهم حالة السوداوية التي تم تحذير المُشاهد منها. فيلم لم يخلو من الجدل أحدث الفيلم ضجة قبل خروجه إلى النور بسبب العديد من الأسئلة ومنها من سيقوم بلعب دور الجوكر بدلا من الممثل ""هيث ليدجر""؟ إلى أن تم الكشف عن ذلك ومعرفة أسم الممثل وهو ""خواكين فينيكس Joaquin Phoenix"" تسبب هذا الأمر في دفع الجمهور إلى حالة من الإنتظار والترقب لما يمكن لخواكين تقديمه في مثل هذه الشخصية المعقدة خاصة وإنه ممثل له ثقل، ولكن لم تنتهي الأسئلة والحيرة عند هذا الحد وبدأت تساؤلات آخرى وهو تخص المخرج، فمخرج العمل تود فيليبس يعرف بإخراجه الأفلام الكوميدية ومنها على سبيل الأمر The Hangover بأجزاء الفيلم الثلاث وفيلم Due Date وبالطبع هم على النقيض من صورة الجوكر الدموية وطبيعة الشخصية المحفورة داخل ذاكرة المتفرج بسبب قراءة القصص المصورة ومشاهدة أفلام باتمان والجوكر، ومع ذلك لم تتوقف حالة الجدال والتخوف عند هذا الحد فعقب الإعلان الأول عنه قامت المباحث الفدرالية بتحذير جنودها FBI من حضور الفيلم لما أتسم به الإعلان من مشاهد دموية كما زعموا في تقاريرهم ، المثير في الأمر إنه بعد عرض الفيلم في مختلف دور العرض كانت ردود الأفعال شديدة الإنحياز بين محبي وكارهي الفيلم حيث لا وجود لحالة وسطية بينهم ؛ الحالة المنتشرة من الجدل هو أمر مفرح في حقيقة الأمر لأنه أبسط ما تستحقه شخصية ثرية وصعبة البناء مثل الجوكر. جوثام رحم خصب لخلق جوكر لم يسبق للمُشاهد معرفة الحياة الخاصة والنشأة الإجتماعية التي ترعرع فيها ""الجوكر"" حتى يصبح بمثل هذه العدوانية وعدم المنطقية، فكل ما سبق معرفته كان قشور سطحية عنه وعن الآذى الذي تعرض له في مدينة جوثام فقط، أما في فيلم ""جوكر Joker"" يستطيع المتفرج أن يشاهد الحياة السوداوية التي سعى آرثر للتعامل معها منذ اللحظات الآولى من الفيلم، أظهر المخرج فيليبس مدينة جوثام بأنها شوارع تفيض بالقمامة والقاذورات وذلك عن طريق حركة الكاميرا عند جانبي الشارع فضلا عن الإذاعة التي تخص أحوال البلدة بأنها مدينة ممتلئة بالقمامة والفئران، وفي هذه الأثناء كانت الألوان المستخدمة لتظهر البلدة هي ألوان غاية في السواد خافتة في إضاءتها تشعرنا بحالة من البؤس والحزن وليس الغضب والثورة، في هذه المدينة ايضا نجد حديث تلفزيوني تعمد فيه المرشح السياسي بإهانة الشعب عن طريق وصفهم بأنهم مجرد مهرجين، الصور السابقة سعت إلى تمهيد عالم ديستوبي تعمه الفوضى وهمي ليس للخير مكانا فيه حتى لا ينصدم المُشاهد من مشهد ما. تدور أحداث الفيلم حول شخصية آرثر، آرثر شاب يعمل كمهرج محدود الدخل والموهبة ايضا وسنعرف الأسباب فيما بعد، يتعرض إلى تعدي جسدي وضرب مبرح من قبل مراهقين بدون وجه حق، لكنه لم يحاول الدفاع عن نفسه وفضلا عن ذلك لم يقف الأمر عند هذا الحد بل تعرض للمضايقات والتنمر من قبل رئيسه وزملاؤه في العمل ماعدا زميله القزم، من خلال أحداث الفيلم نكتشف إصابة آرثر بمرض يدفعه إلى الضحك الهستيري المرضي الذي لا يتوقف، يبدأ آرثر في الضحك عندما يكون أمام مواقف تثير غضبه وسخريته ولكن بسبب تعارض ضحكاته مع الموقف عليه أن يستمر في جلساته العلاجية أملا في تحسن حالته. يعيش آرثر مع والدته المريضة في شقة بسيطة ومبنى متهالك ورغم كل ما سبق يبذل آرثر كل ما في وسعه من أجل سعادة والدته والعناية بها، وخلال هذه الأثناء يعطيه زميل له مسدس حتى يكون وسيلته في الدفاع عن نفسه في عالم يزداد فيه الجنون يوما بعد يوم ومع توالي الأحداث يلجأ آرثر إلى إستخدامه ولكن دون الشعور بالذنب تجاه القتلى وتتولى الخيبات أثناء أحداث الفيلم إلى أن تصبح حياته أكثر أهمية من موته الذي كان يتمناه. الشخصيات المهمشة في حياة آرثر الأمر اللافت إلى الإنتباه أن جميع شخصيات الفيلم هم شخصيات تستحق الرثاء والشفقة مع إختلاف تلك الدرجة فالسياسي نفسه يتم قتله أمام أسرته في نهاية الفيلم، النساء الذين ظهروا في حياة آرثر مهمشات في حقيقة الأمر فنجد ""والدته"" سيدة مسنة مريضة أرغمت آرثر على أن يكون لقبه هو Happy رغبة منها في أن يكون آرثر وسيلة لإضحكاك الآخرين لا لنفسه وهو الأمر الغير مفهوم فمن الطبيعي أن تسعى الأم إلى سعادة إبنها وليس إلى سعادة الآخرين عن طريق التضحية بإبنها لكن آرثر كان متقبل لرغباتها ولهذا سعى لأن يكون مهرج ولكنه بالطبع مهرج لا يضُحِك بسبب إفتقاره لمثل هذه الموهبة، خلال أحداث الفيلم ترسل الأم خطابات بصورة مستمرة إلى الرجل الذي سبقت أن عملت لديه وتظل طوال الفيلم في حالة إنتظار من أجل الحصول على رد وعن طريق الخطأ يقرأ آرثر الخطاب الآخير ليعلم أن والده هو هذا الرجل السياسي المرشح في الإنتخابات، حاول آرثر الوصول إليه ولكن عند مواجهته قام بنكر الأمر وتعنيفه مفجرا حقيقة مرض والدة آرثر العقلي ويخبره بمرض والدته العقلي وبالفعل يجد آرثر أوراق تثبت ذلك، يضع هنا المخرج المُشاهد في حيرة حقيقية ففي عالم مماثل إلى العالم الذي يعيش فيه آرثر يسهل تزييف الحقائق لأن جوثام مجتمع ديستوبي مشوه وملوث يغلب عليه الإنهيار المجتمعي والقمع السياسي مما يعطي إحتمالية زيف هذه الأوراق ولكن طريقة الحصول عليها تؤكد احتمالية صدقها، ولهذا لا توجد حقيقة مطلقة في هذا الفيلم، بل تكاد تكون الحقيقة هنا هو أنه لا يوجد حقيقة! التلاعب المتكرر في الفيلم بتنقله الدائم بين أكثر من رواية يفقد المتفرج القدرة على تصديق اي من الروايتين ولا يكون منه إلا أن يستمتع بمشاهدة الفيلم وهو قابل إلى تصديق جميع الروايات. التلاعب الآخر الذي ظهر بوضوح في الفيلم كان عن طريق شخصية ""الجارة"" وهي Single Mother تعمل على تربية ابنتها بمفردها دون اي وجود لرجل في حياتها، صاحبة بشرة سمراء ومن المسلمات في تاريخ العنصرية هو وجود أمرأة ليست متزوجة وسمراء في بلد أوروبية مما جعل وجودها في مثل هذه الهيئة الشكلية والوضع الإجتماعي هو تأكيد على التهميش الواقع عليها داخل مدينة جوثام، يحتك آرثر بها في المصعد وتنشأ بينهم علاقة رومانسية عذبة ومن خلالها تكون داعم حقيقي له والشخص الثاني بعد والدته الذي يثق في موهبته فنشاهدها مبتسمة أثناء سماعها إلى نكاته، ولكن طبيعة هذا الفيلم دائما ما تصدم المُشاهد فهي لا تعرفه! إذ فقد كانت كل المشاهد التي أتسمت بالعذوبة عبارة خيال ورغبة داخلية لدى آرثر تمنى العيش فيها، وهذا بالتحديد أمر مهم لمن يريد البحث حول دوافع الجوكر إلى القتل لأن معايشة الخيال وكأنه الواقع هو أكبر دليل على كونه شخصية مضطربة ذهنيا. كان آرثر يمتلك دوافع إنتحارية أخبر بها ""طبيبته"" بوضوح لكنها لم تلق لحديثه اي اهتمام فقد كانت تكتب له ورقة الأدوية المصرح له بتناولها والمدعومة ماليا، عندما أراد آرثر للمرة الآولي أن يتحدث بما يدور بداخله بكل صراحة إلى الطبيبة كان ردها عليه أن المجتمع لا يهتم به وبها فقد تم إيقاف التمويل لهم وسيكون على كل منهما أن يسعى في طريقه بعيدا عن الآخر، هذا الأمر الذي حدث بالفعل في عام 1981 عندما ألغى الرئيس الأميريكي رونالد ريغان قانون أنظمة الصحة العقلية لعام 1980 الذي أصدره جيمي كارتر، ما تسبب في دفع العديد من الأشخاص الذين كانوا تحت المظلة التأمينية إلى الشوارع وكأن هذا الخط الدرامي هو إسقاط وتعرية لحقيقة ما حدث قديما مما يؤكد إمكانية خلق جوكر في مثل هذه المجتمعات بسهولة. بسبب عدم وجود إشراف طبي كان من المنطقي أن تسوء حالة آرثر إلى حد الإنتحار ولكن طريقته في التعبير عن معاناته كانت في القتل والرقص والإبتسام والضحك الحقيقي لأول مرة، فعندما لجأ آرثر إلى القتل اختفت حالته المرضية التي تخص ضحكاته المضطربة اللاإرادية، وكأنها تأكيد على يقين آرثر من مقولة الفيلسوف جان بول سارتر ""الجحيم هو الآخرون"" فعن طريق القضاء عليهم تمكن من الرقص بخفة ورشاقة وأمتلك وجهة نظر في هذه الحياة. آرثر ولد طيبا لماذا لجأ آرثر إلى القتل؟ في جريمته الآولى التي لجأ فيها إلى المسدس كان لديه غرض نبيل من المضحك قول ذلك ولكنها الحقيقة، عندما شاهد آرثر مضايقة ثلاث شبان إلى فتاة داخل محطة المترو تصاعدت ضحكاته بسبب سخطه من الموقف وهنا حاولوا هم التعدي عليه، دافع عن نفسه للمرة الأولي فقتل أحدهم، كانت المرة الآولي التي يخشاه فيه أحد فقتل الثاني والثالث حينها بدأ الشعب يشيد بأفعاله ويرتدون أقنعة المهرج مثله أثناء قيامهم بالثورة، رد فعل أهالي مدينة جوثام كان التعرية الحقيقة لهذا المجتمع فجميع أفراده ليسوا سوى جوكر في إنتظار فرصة مناسبة للتكالب والثورة وإعمام الفوضى، المهمش ينتظر فرصة واحدة حقيقية من أجل إثبات نفسه حتى يعوض حالة اللامرئي الذي فرضها المجتمع عليه وهنا ليس من المنطقي أن نطلب منه أن يظهر بصورة أخلاقية بل على العكس كلما ظهر بصورة مشوهة كلما كان أوقع لطبيعته. لم يكن من الصعب الإقدام على تنفيد الجريمة الثانية وهي القتل بالوسادة، قتل آرثر والدته بسبب إكتشافه انها السبب الرئيسي في تدمير حياته بإصابته بهذا المرض المزمن من الضحك بسبب تعذيبها المميت له في صغره، آرثر لم يعش يوما واحدا سعيد في حياته، بطل تراجيدي في وضع مأساوي منذ نعومه أظافره يجبر المُشاهد على الشعور بالشفقة تجاهه ودعم عمليات العنف والقتل التي قام بها، ولهذا كانت جريمته الثالثة مرضية نفسيا للمُشاهد وهي تهشيمه رأس زميله في العمل الذى آتى إلى منزله لزيارته فهشم آرثر رأسه أمام صديقهم القزم ومما يؤكد أن قتله لمن حوله لم يكن إعتباطي وإنما لغرض إنتقامي لم يقتل القزم بل حاول طمأنته وفتح له باب الشقة حتى يذهب في سلام، وعملية القتل الآخيرة من نصيب مقدم البرامج موراي ""روبرت دي نيرو"" الذي كان يعتبره بؤرة الضوء والسعادة الوحيدة في مدينة جوثام حتى إنه كان يمهد نفسه لمقابلته ويتخيل الأمر أكثر من مرة ولكنه فوجئ بسخريته منه والحط من شأنه، فقتله هو الحل الرادع من أجل إسكات صوت الإعلام التلفزيوني المزيف فهو وجه آخر إلى السلطة التي لا تأبه بالشعب الحقيقي. جوكر وليس الجوكر كان قرار المخرج فيليبس عندما أخرج فيلم بهذا الشكل هو إغراق المُشاهد داخل عالم آرثر وليس عالم الجوكر مما جعل الفيلم منفصل ومختلف عن صورة الجوكر المخلدة في الذاكرة وفي نفس الوقت ساهم في خلق فرضية انها قد تكون الحياة الغامضة التي نشأ فيها الجوكر حتى يصل إإلى مرحلة ما قبل الوحشية الغير مبررة، والجوكر قد لا يكون آرثر بعينه بل هو كل شخص من أبناء بلدة جوثام الذي ذاق الفساد والتعفن داخلها، في هذا الفيلم نجد آرثر قد تحول إلى ""جوكر"" وليس ""الجوكر""، جوكر هو إسم قد تم إختياره بصورة عشوائية في النصف الأخير من الفيلم عندما سخر موراي من آرثر أمام المشاهدين ولم يكن يعلم اسمه فقدمه في فقرته بأسم ""جوكر"". كان الأسلوب الذي لجأ إليه آرثر عند القتل يزداد عدوانية شيئا فشيء كما ذكرت في الفقرة السابقة فمن طلق ناري إلى خنق بالوسائد إلى تهشيم رأس ثم القتل أمام جميع مشاهدي التلفاز، فقد أعترف آرثر وهو في ثوب شخصية الجوكر بقتله للثلاث شباب في برنامج موراي على الهواء مباشرة ولم يقف الأمر عند هذا الحد بل قتل المذيع نفسه الذي سخر منه، امتلك آرثر كل المقومات التي تجعل قتله تبرير منطقي فقد كانوا هم من تسببوا في الآذى الذي تعرض له فكما يقول جان جاك روسو ""الإنسان يولد طيبا، المجتمع يفسده""، لقد أفسد شعب جوثام آرثر وجوكر في نفس الوقت في السابق سخروا منه وتعمدوا تهميشه وعندما تحول إلى قاتل قاموا بتمجيده، وفي الحالتين فهو يستحق شفقة المُشاهد. منطق الجوكر في إتخاذ قراراته ليس بالضرورة ان يكون نفس المنطق لدى المُشاهد الذي يشاهد الفيلم عند إتخاذ نفس القرارات في حياته الواقعية، ولهذا كانت هناك مواقف هجومية تجاه الفيلم بأن البناء الدرامي له ضعيف وغير منطقي، في الحقيقة أن عدم منطقيته هو أحد أسباب أهميته، فالفيلم بأكمله يدور في الثمانيات عند مدينة وهمية تم إفتراضها في عالم القصص المصورة تسمى جوثام، اي انه لا ويوجد ملمس حقيقي لها على أرض الواقع رغم إشاراتها الواضحة والصريحة إلى تشابهها مع مدينة نيويورك ولهذا يكون توظيف أغنية That's Life للمغني Frank Sinatra أمر منطقي، فكل جملة داخل الأغنية تصف الحالة الشعورية لآرثر المحاصر طوال الوقت إلى أن تحول إلى رمز لدى سكان مدينة جوثام ليحقق بذلك هدفه البسيط من هذه الحياة وهو ألا يظل غير مرئي في أعين الجميع قائلا: ""أنا الآن موجود، بدأ الناس في ملاحظتي..""",Joker,Joker - Movie Reviews

There's some problems but eh. This film is what solidified this saga for me. At first the highest i rated one of the films was a 7.6 for ""Empire Strikes Back"". Granted, I was torn about my ratings from the get go, but this film is what really awakened my true feelings. Empire went from a 7.6, to a 7.9, and then after this film, an 8.7. This film barely beating it, at an 8.8/10. I mean, I know it might change later, just like it has been, but for now I feel confident enough about my ratings and reviews; which is a first, ever since I started this saga. The Star Wars Saga went from a good franchise, to being one of my fav universes/franchises in film history. It gripped the Force around me, and now I love it and the Force is with me.

1143,Chris F,"Nov 19, 2021","It's hard to even encapsulate my thoughts in words, because I'm not even sure what I witnessed. Like watching a person in a wheelchair topple down a flight of stairs, I want to do anything to help, and yet I can only sit back and watch aghast knowing that there's only suffering left. This is immensely sad it becomes comedic, in a deeply mournful way. It feels impossible to make a mockery of something with such a powerful legacy such as Star Wars. But Rise of Skywalker somehow exceeded all hopelessly low expectations to be an absolute travesty of filmmaking. I've heard that this was an attempt to reset from the mistakes made in The Last Jedi. And yet the entire runtime of the film is filled with MORE mistakes, nothing of which resolves or absolves the previous poor filmmaking, and all which only makes the situation worse than it already was. It's as if Abrams gave up before he began, attempting to juggle far more than he knew he could, dumping his entire juggling act on the floor, shrugging, and walking away even though he was paid to entertain. The first part of this film is exhausting. The nonsense jump-cutting from scene to scene at (quite literally) lightspeed is so disorienting. It was so hard to wrap my mind about even what the general plot or objectives were as it bounced between conversation and action spectacle. Only when Lando Calrissian makes an obligatory cameo that I was somehow drawn out of my drunken stupor, and realized that I was actually watching a beloved series near and dear to my heart. And then I saw that series so bastardized that it was hard not to sit back and mock the entire thing. Jedi ghosts have super powers! Rey also has healing superpowers, wowee! Is that Palpatine? What's he doing there? Look at all those sith in coliseums. Why are they there? Who knows! It's just nonsense. To think of all the controversy there was when the new trilogy was originally debuting, and the entire Star Wars canon had to be reset just to make it make sense; knowing this is where it all ended up, it's almost a joke that the lore needed to be reconstituted at all. This series stomps on everything you love and acts happy about it. And you're meant to feel joyful that everything you love has been destroyed, truly and completely. You're meant to like this.

JJ has to come back and try to fix this trilogy, an impossible task I'd say, and I'd be correct. This movie is a mess with MAJOR plotholes, and it seems like it satisfied the fans? I don't get that, maybe the positive reaction stems from the after-shock of having to watch Rian Johnson's attempt at butchering the whole franchise, but this movie seriously lacks the Star Wars charm, which George Lucas gave us with his film. The reason why The Force Awakens is held higher than the two later instalments into this sequel trilogy is because that movie has the Star Wars charm, and the nostalgic feeling and hype around watching Star Wars again got to us all. There is serious potential wasted in this sequel trilogy, JJ played it safe, Rian ruined everything, and this is the attempted clean-up... This is a sad attempt, Disney, maybe you should try to bring in a George Lucas or a Dave Filoni in a supervising role or something. Both of them know how to handle this franchise.

1196,Jacob R,"Jul 04, 2021","This is a movie, that even now I still can't really make my mind up about. Like, I enjoyed it, I'm giving it a positive review, but it's easily the weakest of the entire franchise, and I actually don't think it's that close. The biggest problem is that this isn't a ""Toy Story"" movie; it's a movie completely about Woody. Everything is around him, not the rest of the toys. Because it's the fourth film I guess they can do that, but imagine if like a seven year old went with his or her family to watch this movie. They'll like it, but are they going to remember characters like Jessie, Bullseye, and the rest of the gang like the other three films? No, they're just not. In the other three films it felt like the screen time for all the characters were perfectly balanced. In this movie, however, again, it's all about Woody. Another big thing is that the new characters are really either a hit or a miss for me. Like I love Duke Caboom, but not really that tiny officer toy thing. It's like the same thing that Toy Story 3 has, just more of a distraction, at least for me. Now, with all of that said, this is a really enjoyable movie to watch. Animation is great, I like the story enough, but what's not talked about is the setting. Putting this story in a carnival was such a smart idea, and it can lead to a lot of good ""action"" shots. So yeah, I'm recommending it, just don't expect the same impact the other films had. There was really only one scene that left a huge impact for me, and without going into spoilers, it involved Gabby Gabby, the villain. I would put on a lot more Pixar movies before this one, but I wouldn't mind taking this one out of the toy box every now and a then. Go to Disney+ and make you're own opinion on this probably ending of arguably the best animated franchise ever!",Toy Story 4,Toy Story 4 - Movie Reviews

1202,Jerry S,"Jun 15, 2021","Toy Story 4 was pretty good. The animation was top notch and the best out of all of them. The story on the other hand needed some work. I honestly think that this movie should've had a subtitle under it because this feels more like a Woody movie than a a stand alone Toy Story film. I have no problem with it being a Woody movie but the movie is called Toy Story. With this I did expect the story to be about Woody and the toys not just mostly Woody himself. Sure the new characters like Forky, Gabby Gabby, Ducky and Bunny, and Duke Kaboom were memorable and fun to watch it just would've been more entertaining with the other toys that are there. However despite the movie's flaws there's a lot that I enjoy in this one. I enjoy Woody and Bo Peep's relationship. I actually enjoyed the father figure between Woody and Forky and I also enjoyed Bonnie experiencing school for the first time. However my favorite thing about this movie is the ending. I just loved how this movie ended. I really like the idea of Woody doing what he wants for wants he really wants to be with Bo Peep and he finally gets to do that is just so satisfying. This brings so much character development from Woody and opens the door to so many possibilities to tell knew and interesting stories for the toys. So overall was Toy Story 4 perfect? No, but it does do a lot of interesting things to not only keep you engaged but to also make you feel satisfied. 9/10",Toy Story 4,Toy Story 4 - Movie Reviews

1231,Jacob R,"Jun 27, 2021","Man….did Pixar kick off this decade with a bang with another 5 out of 5 movie! The last couple of Pixar movies have been some of my personal favorites, with Cars more suiting as a guilty pleasure than anything else. However, I think Toy Story 3 is better than all of those films by a good bit. First, the story and plot. It's a prison break movie, which I'm already a sucker for. Combine that with the Already great storytelling of Pixar, and you have a chefs kiss for it! Next, the villain. Lotso is probably the best Pixar baddie since Syndrome. He has a great backstory, and for the majority of the film, he wins, which is kind of insane. Now, let's talk about the animation: it's perfect, not too much to talk about there. And the ending, OMG the ending! It's such a great way to end the movie. If I had to nic pic one thing, it's probably the plot line of making Buzz a space ranger again, that seemed a little lazy. But that means we got Spanish Buzz, the funniest part of the film, so it doesn't affect the quality of the movie at all. The question really is is this the best Toy Story film? To me at least, I like the second more, the sole reason being that I like the characters introduced in that one better than this one. Not to say the new characters are bad in anyway, but are they going to leave as big an impact as Jessie or Bullseye? Yeah, me neither. This is a great film, and a perfect way to end this franchise….too bad they made another one, but that's for another review.

I also like the idea of a prison break out of a summer camp. And I also really like how they keep on bringing memorable new characters. And the ending of the film does put you on the edge of your seat. However even though I like the ending of this movie I think it would've been better if it had a tighter good bye to Andy. I think it should've had a little bit more time to feel the emotion through Andy, Woody, and Buzz. But other than that I really enjoyed this movie.

Hamuru 8 parçaya ayırıp parçaların her birini güzelce yuvarlayın. Tezgahı ya da başka bir düz zemini bolca unlayarak hamurları tek tek açın. Tereyağını eritip hamurların üstlerine gezdirin. Hamurları dıştan içe doğru sararak rulolar yapın. Ruloları kendi etraflarında spiral olarak sarıp 10 dakika kadar dinlendirin. Dinlenen hamurları yeniden tabak büyüklüğünde açın. Tereyağını eritip içine suyu ve tuzu ekleyin. Yeniden donmaması için kısık ateşte bekletin. Hamurların her iki tarafını da yapışmaz tavada iyice pişirdikten sonra üzerine yağlı sudan sürün.

Once again the performances are great, and the characters are as great as they were in the first. However this time around, we get introduced to an even more compelling villain than Barbossa from the first film: Davy Jones. Davy Jones is the best villain the ""Pirates"" franchise has to offer. Besides Jones, another aspect of this film that I think puts it above the first is the plot.

On the complete off chance, someone stumbles upon this review who has yet to watch the movie (that's got to be one niche market haha), it's fun, action-packed, has literally the best CG villain of all time, and actually an ok plot. Honestly don't get the hate for number two, it's still got a lot of the good qualities of POTC and hasn't yet gone threes route of being a bit ott and down right messy righting wise. Zimmer's new additions to the score are also very welcome, Klaus did a fantastic job with the first movie, but honestly I think he'd gone as far as he could with creating an incredibly iconic theme. Needed Zimmers expert touch to do the more subtle love themes and breath more life than solely reusing the same old main theme again and again.

Like the first movie, the visuals, music, costume, makeup and set designs are incredibly impressive, the acting is just as good, the film is honestly funnier than the first, it's a much darker movie, the characters are just as great and have clear motivations and once again, we get amazing pirate action scenes especially with the Kraken, the Will vs Norrington vs Jack fight and I love the ending where Sparrow comes back to ‘defeat' the Kraken. Seeing Will's father was also heartwarming and Davy Jones is a great villain and is built to be an intimidating threat but it's flawed. The tribe scene (whilst hillarious) adds nothing to the plot, Beckett does nothing throughout the movie but sit in an office and I just don't find the plot as intriguing as the first movie. It's basically a treasure hunt story without the obstacles. It seems more focused on characters than telling a fun story and because the story isn't over yet, it's also not entirely satisfying but it's still a good movie but the first movie was way better.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest - Movie Reviews

This movie has the best fight scene out of all the pirates' movies. It is well choreographed and worth its 2 hour run time.

To be real, there's never gonna be a Lion King rendition that's gonna come anywhere close to the 1994 classic, let's be honest with ourselves. However for it's credit, this remake did not want to make me leave the theater in disgust. If anything it's a good movie that it's worth a watch, you just gotta dial down your expectations of the movie because some parts of it are kinda watered down and a bit of filler moments are put in there too which would explain this movie being 25 minutes longer than the original. Other than that, it does follow the script to the letter and makes for a good nostalgia high with modernized graphics. Props to the CGI team, this movie does look beautiful, probably the highest mark of the movie. It's not a bad Disney movie at all, the unfortunate part is that it does not surpass what the animated classic has already brought out to us and those are shoes that are almost impossible to fill so I can understand this movie falling short in some parts. It does make for a good comparison of what is being brought to this generation versus what my generation got as a kid growing up in the 90's.",The Lion King,The Lion King - Movie Reviews

While it's a shame that director/producer Jon Favreau added nothing new to this tale (despite proving his capabilities with 2016's vivid and fresh 'The Jungle Book') it manages to retain the soul of the original and is sufficiently entertaining. Excellent voice and vocal performances couple with stunningly life-like depictions of wild Africa and it's animal inhabitants to satisfy fans hoping to relive an old favorite, while offering new viewers an experience approximate to what the rest of us experienced in 1994, albeit with less facially emotive animals.",The Lion King,The Lion King - Movie Reviews

The CGI is the best in any ""Star Wars"" films, and the entire story feels darker though still very welcome. The action is also done very well in this, and the worldbuilding is still very spectacular. About the only bad thing I can really think about this film is that there is quite a number of instances of fan service, though I think that this film handles it better than most other films do. Jones, Luna, Mendelsohn, Yen, and Tudyk are some of the better actors that really give it their all in this film. The humor is also very well and lands a majority of the time.

1350,Yuri L,"Sep 18, 2021","One of the best Star Wars films ever made, and certainly the best one made during Disney's ownership of Lucasfilm. This movie took a risk by dispensing with the orthodox Star Wars formula by not being focused on the Skywalkers, and instead introducing a new set of main characters who all died at the end. The risk paid off. A change in pace from the normal style of Star Wars films worked well. It was nice to watch a Star Wars film without countless scenes about the force and pompous Jedi preaching. Instead we had an intertaining action film which expanded the lore of the Star Wars universe in an interesting and exciting way. The final Battle of Scarif was very well executed, with an epic space battle and a satisfying and unorthodox ending. My only issue with this film is the character of Cassian who was supposed to evoke some sort of false-equivalency between the empire and the rebellion with his stories of committing unforgivable war crimes for the rebellion. This might be a good point regarding conflicts in the real world, and it might have worked in Star Wars but it was awkwardly executed and unbelievable considering the very black and white perspective we get on good and evil in other Star Wars films.",Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,Rogue One: A Star Wars Story - Movie Reviews

I thought all the lead actors played their parts well especially Felicity Jones as Jyn Erso. I think the visuals of this form are more artistically beautiful than the Lucas films - maybe that's the strength of Disney. I also found the plot more convincing. With the original trilogy the main stars always manage to miraculously survive but in such a conflict that wouldn't generally happen. Also the discussion of the morality of war and conflict in the rebel alliance added to the more realistic feel of this film.

All of the musical numbers were done to perfection, as well as the new songs included in the film. The animation looked great, even making a big blue Genie look like he belongs in our world. The only major gripe I have with this movie is the actor who played Jafar was nowhere near as harsh and menacing as the character was in the original.

They also tried WAY too hard to be empowering to women... to the extent they got rid of anything that seemed over-objectifying and gave Jasmine a new song and other quirks that come off as offensive to people in the middle east who have gender roles as a cultural norm.

The big problem with this movie is it banks on the audience connecting and caring about what happens to all of these new characters which just isn't the case. In fact the only familiar faces&people the audience cares about were Barbossa and Jack which are still great characters and all but there was none of the buildup like in Pirates 2&3. Because by the end of the movie nothing has happen except that a few new characters that we barely got an introduction to died which has no relevance to the series. That aside however there were some great scenes with Capt. Jack and Barbossa the palace scene for example and in all is certainly not as bad of a film as Pirates 5. So in all I would say a solid 7/10 film!",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides - Movie Reviews

1447,Matthew D,"Jul 10, 2020","A return to form for this piracy centered franchise. Rob Marshall breathes life into a dead series with his swashbuckling adventure picture Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011). Borrowing heavily from the previous installments and Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade, Marshall takes us on a curious sea voyage seeking The Fountain of Youth and eternal life. Gore Verbinski's original Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy was much darker and more distinct, but Rob Marshall makes pretty well made films with a sleekness that's comforting. Johnny Depp is hilarious as the bumbling Captain Jack Sparrow, who improvises his way to victory with some clever wordplay and devious cunning. Geoffrey Rush's Captain Hector Barbossa is still fiercely entertaining with a raging vengeance sailing him towards Blackbeard. The gorgeous Penélope Cruz is cool as a sword fighting love interest for Sparrow as the voluptuous and vexing Angelica Teach. She's a wonderful addition to On Stranger Tides and adds a formidable foil element to bounce comedy, romance, and swashbuckling off of Sparrow. Ian McShane has a gravitas as Blackbeard, but I wish he got more screen time. If his crew were not focused on so much, he could have fought and killed more as Blackbeard to make him more intimidating and scary into the dread pirate Blackbeard. Kevin McNally is still steadfast and funny as first mate Joshamee Gibbs. Sam Claflin is nice and charming as priest Philip Swift. His romantic affair with the enchanting French mermaid, played by the hauntingly lovely Astrid Bergès-Frisbey, is a nice side plot for On Stranger Tides. Richard Griffiths has a hilarious cameo as King George II. Keith Richards kills it again as Jack's father Captain Teague Sparrow. He's mysterious and entertaining, while providing a serious presence in his scenes. Dame Judi Dench gets a funny quick cameo as High Society Lady. Marshall knows how to direct interesting action sequences like the double duel or the mermaid encounter with intricate timing. Marshall is also competent at directing sincere drama, but he leans too heavily here into the hectic near improvised humor. I wanted more romance drama between Captain Jack Sparrow and Angelica as well as more character development for Blackbeard. Marshall's direction is engaging and slick enough to keep me easily entertained by On Stranger Tides' 136 minutes. It's more compact than previous movies with David Brenner and Wyatt Smith's editing is more forward thinking and efficient than the bloated jump cut riddled At World's End. Hans Zimmer returns to cascade us with epic classical music for his Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides score. Heavy strings and intense percussion mark his sonic style with beautiful compositions throughout On Stranger Tides. Penny Rose's period costumes continue to amaze me with realistic pirate outfits down to the floppy hats and boots. Ve Neill's make-up is still excellent as I still like his use of black eye liner and dirty looks for all the pirates. It's not perfect with Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio rely too much on past in jokes instead of new bits, plus Blackbeard's crew being zombies is dumb and has essentially already been done in The Curse of the Black Pearl. Elliott and Rossio create a mysterious atmosphere with their intriguing writing with plenty of fun humor and lighthearted action. Dariusz Wolski's cinematography features heavenly fountain wide shots to intense mermaids attacking from dark waters with striking shots. Wolski is a creative cinematography with a stalwart style for Pirates of the Caribbean. In conclusion, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a refreshing splash of cold water to the face after the wayward and bloated At World's End.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides - Movie Reviews

1455,Puroo R,"Jul 27, 2021","I had watched Despicable Me only so that I could finally understand what the whole deal with the minions was. But I ended up liking the movie and all the characters in that. As a result I decided to watch the sequel as well, which I ended up liking even more than the first one. So I thought why not just go all out and watch every single movie? And so I watched this one, and I really I think it was not something really great, although it did manage to do what it was meant to do: give us the laughs and have a good time. Despicable Me 3 is about Gru finding out about his estranged brother Dru who is living a very rich life but does not have the evil nature of Gru and thus is not liked as much by his family. And so grew is forced to take his brother along with him to stop the evil villain Balthazar Bratt, a child actor from the 80s who has faded away with time. Although the minions in this movie are way less than the previous two I don't mind this at all. In fact I kind of found them annoying and I wanted more of the human characters than those yellow Facebook meme sources. Balthazar is my favourite villain from this franchise. All his acts are very funny. Whenever he is on the screen you know you are in for some good time. There are often callbacks to his show which is very campy and has barred CGI according to today's times, which is just like how we see shows from the 80s today. He always dances and plays songs whenever he is out on the heist. It is fun to watch Gru and Balthazar fight in the opening scene and also the way Baltasar dances as he defeats all the guards on the ship. The animation of this movie is way better than the previous two, especially when it comes to the action scenes and car chasing. What this movie lacks in however, is the amount of campiness and cliched moments of having an amateur person come out on a secret mission along with the professional friend/family member. In fact the whole idea of the protagonist having an estranged twin brother is a cliched idea which has been used many times in Bollywood films. Although this isn't a very memorable movie, it does exactly what all the other movies from this franchise do. It is able to create a fantasy world with fun and loving characters who do goofy things and we enjoy them while it lasts. And this is the reason why I don't think this franchise should have more movies. By the time one movie comes we have already forgotten what happened in the previous one. Although I wouldn't say that this is a bad movie, I would definitely say that you would not remember anything other than the good parts once the movie ends, and this is the reason why this movie is so much fun to remember since I don't exactly remember what I didn't like about it.",Despicable Me 3,Despicable Me 3 - Movie Reviews

The movie has only two major weaknesses that are easy to get past being that there is too many plots and that it relies on juvenile humor and toilet humor more than the last two. However, these are just small flaws and are easy to look past once you see the plots mesh together in a really satisfying way. This movie had some pretty good highlights, like when Gru said his mother told him that his father died of disappointment when he was born as well.

1506,Jacob R,"Jul 02, 2021","I behold to you…..the best Pixar sequel that isn't a Toy Story film! So I liked this movie a lot….and that's pretty much it. I guess I could dive into all the things they changed. For example, because Dory is now the main character, Marlin and Nemo are sidelined. I don't see that as a problem with Nemo, because that's what happened in the first film. It's more Marlin that I'm disappointed in. He became just a meaner version of his character from the original sometimes, so I started to kind of dread when he came on screen. Next, all the new characters. Except for probably Hank, I don't think I'm going to remember them the same way I remember the side characters from the original film. Oh, and just to get it out of the way, voice acting and animation is once again spectacular. The setting feels like a new breath of fresh air too, with it being an aquarium. The story is pretty simple, but besides the two 5 out of 5 Pixar films this decade so far (Toy Story 3 and Inside Out), all of them have been pretty simple stories. I guess the one big problem that I have is that Dory's flashbacks are important and nice, but a little too convenient for the plot, and by the end, way too repetitive. Speaking of the ending, it's absolutely bonkers that a fish and a septopus can drive a truck, but I kind of love how crazy it is. Oh yeah…and this film has a big emotional moment, which the original, in my opinion, does not have. This is of course being when Dory is reunited with her parents. It's a chefs kiss of an emotional scene. So, is this film better than the original? No, I don't really think it's that close to be honest. But, is this a good film that I think everyone should watch! Hell ya! It has its problems, but they in no way ruin the film, at least for me.

I thought the story was touching of how Dory was finally able to see her actual family was pretty charming and heartwarming at times. However the only issue that I have with this movie is that it does feel long like the first one and some scenes could be cut out mostly some of the scenes between Nemo and Marlin because to me they felt like they were here just because they were here in the first movie. However with that being said though the movie is actually pretty interesting. I find it nice that for Dory we're getting more on her character than the first movie and this film does do a good job of making you care about the new characters that are in this movie.

It's a nice role-reverse on the ‘Finding' premise and the voice acting is top-notch from the characters old and new alike. The new characters, by the way, are easy to warm up to and easily fit into this world. The pacing of the movie is great end-to-end, and the intentions of each character are clear which makes the story easy to follow.

The inclusion of some characters felt unnecessary to the plot, and the humor in this film is miles away from the witty humor that the previous films had. The CGI and action is a significant improvement in this film, with much more spectacle to the fights. There were some odd lines said in the movie, and I think some of the acting is extremely flawed. However, the villains are great and the vast number of Jedi introduced is not done in a way where its hard to remember the names. Overall, while the film does have its good parts, there are quite a number of bad parts when compared to the previous films and I can see why die-hard fans of the original trilogy continue to hate on this film, though I don't personally think its as bad as most people will say.",Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace - Movie Reviews

1577,Dale R,"Nov 15, 2021","This film is an amalgamation of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll with a tiny bit of the 1951 Disney film thrown into the filter of Tim Burton's direction. While I was excited to see Burton's version of Wonderland, the movie changed so much of the characters from the source material that it was not a movie about Wonderland. So much so that they changed the name of Wonderland to Underland. This film looks terrific, from the costumes Alice wears to the CGI. I also enjoy the story arc of Alice and the new character of Bayard. The rest of the characters are reduced to delivering exposition or short gags. If you would like to see a totally unique version of Lewis Carroll's works then check this movie out, otherwise skip it.",Alice in Wonderland,Alice in Wonderland - Movie Reviews
1578,Latifa P,"Oct 26, 2021",This movie was visually entertaining but that was it for me. Just a lot of the same tired old hollywood tropes. The storyline didn't really make sense and so many lines that attempted to be heartfelt made me cringe. Although it attempted to be a feminist piece the narrative is so unbelievable in terms of gender norms of the period that this fantasy take feels like a mocking joke. I guess a period piece loosely based on Alice in Wonderland is another great excuse to employ an all-white cast and another skinny blond lead. Overall a shallow shiny package that failed to present anything genuinely meaningful or thought-provoking.,Alice in Wonderland,Alice in Wonderland - Movie Reviews
1579,Nathan D,"Jul 19, 2021","First off, I want to state how boring this movie is. It has serious pacing issues with it moving so slow. Some of the scenes were stretched out for too long and include unnecessary dialogue and weird visual elements. For instance, the Futterwacken scene at the end of the movie is not funny and wastes time. I appreciate the call back to the actual book, but it's just not amusing to watch. This wasted time could have easily been put to good use in the final battle scene which is so anti-climatic. It's such a shame that we went on such a long journey through Wonderland just for the final battle to be only around 10 minutes with 2-3 minutes of that being the Jabberwocky battle. The story is also very poorly written. It all just falls apart after Alice makes her way into the Red Queen's castle. The whole ""Um"" bit is not funny whatsoever and is stretched out way too long. I know that Alice has grown and that whole aspect does make some sense. However, the Knaves of Hearts not noticing it sooner or pointing it out sooner made no sense and felt like just a lazy way to create the heist scene. A lot of the Red Queen's story is very poorly written which is such a shame because Helena Bonham Carter does a good job in the role. Speaking of the cast, it's a mixed bag. The voice cast does a nice job, but the on-screen talent is a little off. Both Johnny Depp and Mia Wasikowska have some nice moments, but their line delivery is off most of the time. As I said before, Helena Bonham Carter does a nice job as the Red Queen. Crispin Glover and Anne Hathaway do a decent job, but their roles feel more like parodies of the characters rather than them actually embodying the roles they were placed in. The world around these characters is really bad. The visuals are so bland and dark that it doesn't even feel like Wonderland. I get why Tim Burton would have made that choice as their lives are all kind of miserable at the moment, but even the flashback scenes look dull and unimaginative. I would have loved to have seen some more color pop off the screen when Alice defeated the Jabberwocky. I think it would have made the film's final scenes in Wonderland be more at a decent level rather than just outright bad. Overall, this film is just a big mess with poor editing, a below-average story, and a cast that doesn't quite shine. Tim Burton doesn't do anything outstanding and just feels like lazy directing and storytelling. When Tim Burton said he had never felt any emotional tie-in to the book, that should've been some major red flags that this film would not be good in any shape or form.

What are common traits of Mercury Poisoning? Depression. Anxiety. Clumsiness. Hallucinations. Who was Mercury in mythology? The God of Thieves, and a messenger to Gods. What does Mercury hold in his hand? That is the Caduceus. That is Kundalini. That is the ancient brother-sister duo battling themselves; Fuxi and Nuwa. If we are all sitting at the table of the Mad Hatter, we are bound to have consumed his poison.

The plot is drastically changed from the original book, but it still have charm and uniqueness of story. Alice the protagonist of the story have grown up to a woman and forgotten Wonderland, she was expected to be someone she's not and still can't find her way. She is brought to Wonderland again by white rabbit according to the prophecy that ‘Alice' will slay Jabberwocky save but there's a question that ‘Is she the right Alice, the same one in the prophecy' and Alice also doubt that. Life of Alice is not smooth and Wonderland become a place full of danger but that's what make this movie interesting. Some characters are threaten, kidnapped, prisoned, and nearly executed but it's still in safe zone that people every age can watch together. In climax, Alice enter the war and slay Jabberwocky, fighting scene is not exciting and quite predictable for fantasy adventure movie with no fight experience woman protagonist but the war end beautifully. When back to her world, she returns as an elegant, brave and confident woman who walk in her own way. The background is mysterious but powerful and beautiful.

1598,Jonathan K,"Jan 15, 2021","Despite how serene the lead actress is and how competent the CGI is constructed, this might be one of the most unpleasant looking movies I have ever seen. Yes, it's Tim Burton so it's meant to be at least semi-repellent visually, but Tim Burton also relies almost entirely on his visual aesthetic, which makes this unpleasant aspect of the movie the central focus. What's unfortunate is that this was originally sold to many audiences as an Adaptation of the American McGee version, which already looks like a Tim Burton version, just better, with far, far better writing, so this would've been better. Instead, we're left with the kind of poor-to-abysmal quality script that seems to accompany most Tim Burton films, not only giving us wonky and sometimes incoherent storytelling, but even manages to mold the movie with almost every current-day Cinematic Fantasy Cliche, resulting in an Army vs Army battle with Alice as some kind of makeshift Valkyrie with a magic sword. There is good to be found -- Burton's usual use of slightly over-the-top performances complements this world as it's over the top in itself, Elfman turns in a surprisingly pleasant and epic score (considering all of his past scores for Burton films have just been off-key strings to make you feel icky and uncomfortable), and the art, while inherently repellent, is actually of solid quality for the most part; like, if I saw many of these on some place like DeviantArt I would think ""That's pretty interesting"" - the problem is that the movie never stops with it. It was a miscalculation to have the Evil Queen get so much screen-time as she is far and away the most visually unpleasant aspect of the movie, and the fact that the movie was made during the 3D boom means that she is commonly in ultra-closeup. And frankly, it just feels like Tim Burton isn't fitted to make a movie that is >90% CGI - he does have some talent with the tangible, physical world, and this movie makes me feel happy that he has opted to stay away from this kind of filmmaking since.",Alice in Wonderland,Alice in Wonderland - Movie Reviews

1604,Meydiana R,"Oct 31, 2020","I went into this film without high expectations. I saw so many ways it could go wrong, and many of Burton's more recent films have left me feeling somewhat indifferent. However, all my fears were for naught. I adored the film, without reservation. Indeed, this is not only one of Burton's best films, it is probably the best screen adaptation of Lewis Carroll ever (with the possible exception of Jan Svankmajer's Neco z Alenky from 1988). It isn't often that a film ends and I immediately want to see it again, but that's how Burton's Alice in Wonderland affected me. The cast is flawless, top to bottom. The film's vision comes the closest anyone has come to capturing the frenetic, nonsensical impossibility of Wonderland (and I loved the whole ""Underland"" thing). I'm hearing all sorts of bizarre negative criticisms, though none with merit. This is a bold and triumphant film, one that finally addresses, without holding back, the darkness and complexity and maturity of Carroll's writing. I will add that I saw it in 2-D, and was pleased that Burton avoided letting the 3-D thing ruin the movie, as is so often the case with that sadly popular gimmick. The film is a giddy, hallucinatory, unrelenting dance of shadow and light, hilarious and heartbreaking, brash and underscored, possessed of all the marvelously contradictory oppositions that characterize the source material. For the first time, I think, it felt as though Alice were truly an integral part of the landscape, and not just some baffled Victorian tourist passing through. And the climactic battle with the Jabberwocky...just wow. I cannot recommend this film strongly enough. (--Caitlín R. Kiernan)",Alice in Wonderland,Alice in Wonderland - Movie Reviews

I've seen it at least 5 times, but each time it remains a perfectly aimed film. The animations are spectacular and from 10 and praise: the hairs are treated in detail and the areas of the city are memorable. Even in the characters sector we only have iconic characters: Nick is my favorite, well characterized and with a poignant background. Judy is a great protagonist and with a beautiful story arc. The sheep is a nice twist villain that the first time I wouldn't have bet a cent on her, and good motivation too. The story is deeply inspired, unpredictable and manages to entertain. The jokes are genuine and very funny. Zootopia is a great film that makes perfection its philosophy: there is nothing negative to mention and I'm really trying to find something!

There's a modicum of comedy, a dose of mystery and an underdog component but no facet of the movie is fantastic.

Despite how much time is spent on action scenes they accomplish very little narratively.

I rewatched it with my wife and managed to enjoy it, but the decision to shoot in 48fps was even more jarring at home since we watched it only a couple days after finishing the LOTR trilogy. I actually loved the changes Peter made to flesh out the story into a trilogy; it did cause the runtime to bloat more than seemed necessary, but The Hobbit is actually one of the worst-written books I have ever read in my life and I've held that opinion since the first time I read it at age 12. If I hadn't read it myself I would have never believed that anyone, let alone a vaunted GOAT writer like Tolkien, had ever written a book whose entire purpose is building toward the excitement of the Dwarves' showdown with the dragon at the end, only to hastily cram in a different character in a single chapter and have him be the one to kill the dragon. My hatred of Bard the Bowman has colored my entire life since then, as I have a heightened sensitivity to perceived deus ex machina and I dislike Luke Evans as an actor because he played him. The only other gripe I have here is that Thorin was portrayed as rude, entitled and aggressive from the very beginning here, making his eventual heel turn completely unsurprising and his redemption arc ineffective at making me like the guy.

Devoted fans of the book will not enjoy the departures and inclusions, but for movie fans who did not ingest JRR Tolkien's dense and sometimes slow-moving children's story in their pre-teenage years, this film version will entertain more than adequately for its entire (long) length.",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - Movie Reviews
1687,Mohammed A,"Mar 28, 2021","A solid prequel to Lord of the Rings. It's nowhere near as good but that doesn't mean it's bad and expecting a movie as good as LOTR is basically you setting yourself up for disappointment. Every actor is amazing, especially Ian McKellen, Andy Serkis and I prefer Martin Freeman's Bilbo Baggin over Elijah Wood's Frodo Baggins. It has some well-choreographed action that makes creative use of the environment, it's visually dazzling and I know people have a problem with the overuse of CGI in these movies but this movie is innocent in that complaint and it's great seeing old locations like Rivendell and new locations as well as new creatures like goblins and it was a joy being back in middle earth, which is what I wanted. It can be funny and supenseful and a lot of amazing character moments like when Bilbo rescues Thorin and Howard Shore delivers an excellent score again. There's a lot of filler like the stuff with trolls and stone giants and it does drag in lots of places. There's no need for this to be nearly 3 hours long and it also lacks the suspense and stakes of the original series we're not 100% invested in the dwarves's journey as the consequences of failing won't be big. Plus, it has some tonal inconsistencies and a lot of moments where apparently physics doesn't exist but regardless, it's an enjoyable time and I'd definitely rewatch it.",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - Movie Reviews

Yes, it does a great job with world building and cinematography. Even the acting and plot is well done. But the fatal flaw here is it is trying to set up something that has already happened (Star Wars prequels, anyone?) LoTR was an expansive world-ending extravaganza, whereas the Hobbit (at least the book) was supposed to be one quiet hobbit's experience with the outside world. The movie flips that all around and makes the Hobbit quite a big more expansive (and longer) than maybe it should have been.

Aunque no sea una gran película, esta película logra ser entrañable en pocos minutos, con personajes muy originales y muy bien construidos, en pocos minutos te enamoras del mundo de Harry Potter. Me parece que los efectos especiales de esta película envejecieron muy mal. Muchos quedando al día de hoy en pañales, aunque los efectos prácticos de esta película siguen estando igual de frescos e impactantes. Otra cosa que no me encantó de la película fue que en muchos momentos la trama se siente estirada, creo que la película tiene muchas escenas que no aportan mucho a la película y eso la hace tediosa en algunos momentos.

The main plot of the movie does not get introduced until well into the movie, and even then the main plot doesn't get much screen time at all. It's interesting to see the characters behave in the situations they are put in, but not as interesting as if these situations actually had some relevance to the plot. I feel like if this movie was released in modern times, it would not have had any sequels, much like many other movies that focused too much on setting up a sequel and forgot to be a good movie itself.

This a clearly a big budget film, and the quality shows through in all areas.

1714,ANDERSON G,"Aug 17, 2021","""Hary Potter"" is the beginning of everything, the beginning of a saga that would become one of the greatest anthologies of cinema that garners many merits, being a good adaptation of the book, a remarkable creation of characters, costumes and aesthetics, the last being its greatest merit. The script adapted by Steve Kloves manages to synthesize the most important elements of the book, of course, the book is more tense and complete, but steve manages to bring the spirit to the screen just like its director, Chris Columbus, who gives a really magical touch to the film, whether in its details, in its dark photography, the magical elements in the compositions of gothic and bizarre backdrops to even its perfect soundtrack, adding that to a great cast that perfectly matches its characters, the biggest merit here is the feeling that we are watching something really wizard, the displacement with reality is very well constructed. Far from being perfect but extremely competent, ""Hary Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" sums up the books well, has great characters, although not yet performative, has a beautiful direction, good effects for the time and a timeless art direction.

The CGI was a bit not smooth at times, but it was still good considering the technology at the time. The main trio was also introduced, and their dynamic was also entertaining. I especially liked Emma Watson's character the most. She was clever, talkative, and quirky. And because of her confidence she didn't get too many friends, which was sad, but she's in the trio now. Since I enjoyed the magical world a lot, I honestly didn't care much about the main story of this movie. Even though there's a twist that was unexpected, I still didn't feel much about it. This movie's primary objective was clearly to introduce Harry Potter and the world he just stepped into, so the main story wasn't focused on as much. Overall, an entertaining and fun movie.

1750,Tom R,"Oct 31, 2021","Firstly, it was a great idea to split the final book into 2 parts. They should have done that with other books as well. Secondly, even though alot of this film is ""build up"" - it's still entertaining the whole way through - gives us some of the darkest trials and tribulations our trio has faced - and includes the saddest death in the series of all time. It's an emotional roller coaster and prepares the setup for an incredible ending. This film is still a must see affair for all those watching Potter - and it's best to play very close attention, you'll have nearly zero questions at the end of the series.

1751,Karina A,"Sep 29, 2021","One of my favorite movies is Harry Potter. This is a whole series of films directed by Chris Columbus. The first film was released in 2001 in the UK. The films are based on books by Joan Rowling. The story tells the story of an orphan boy living with his uncle and aunt. On his 11th birthday, Harry suddenly learns that he owns magic and goes to Hogwarts. There he meets Hermione Ron, and the main events of the films take place with them. The scenery of the film simply fascinates with its beauty, delightful landscapes, flying on brooms, everything immerses you in this magical world.

Instead the audience are stuck watching their favourite characters brooding in a variety of forests, causing the audience member to become quite bored.

The opening scene of this movie was the best so far. The long chase through the Muggle's world was fast and riveting. The camera angles were creative with many cuts. They were a little bit disorienting, but still entertaining. What I liked the most was in this one, the trio spent most of their time together. Everywhere they went, the dark order was there and ready to ambush them. Even worse, the danger was so great that it affected the friendship. Also the romance, not as big of a part in this one, was still there. I enjoyed the focus on the trio quite a bit. In addition to the trio trying to run away from the dark order, they learned more about the history of you-know-who, as well as other important characters. There was a lot of mystery being explored, and it got me invested throughout the runtime. Overall, a dark and grim continuation of the story that is nearly coming to an end.

1774,Jordan M,"Apr 09, 2021","While still great, this was the least-best movie of the series for me. Not only was it by far the least-entertaining, the section of the book this covers was rather poorly written, and them splitting it in two left far too much time for scenes that weren't as good as the second-act scenes of the rest of the series had been. Without the structure of Hogwarts a lot of the scenes felt written for the sole purpose of tying up character arcs -- it would've been illogical to hold a big wedding when there were practically still warm corpses laying about and it didn't make sense for Voldemort not to be in Malfoy Manor or quickly summoned there when they identified Harry's friends. That scene and the finding of Gryffindor's sword felt like deus ex machina in that their way out of the mess was far too convenient and unlikely. Dumbledore obfuscating the clues Harry would use to locate Horcruxes to the point he risks them not being found at all doesn't withstand scrutiny either; obviously he needed to keep the information secure, but he would've thought of a more practical way... in the very first movie he bewitched a mirror so that only a person with good intentions would get the stone by looking at it, for example. Nearly all the character development in this half is dark & they spent a little too much time visually flirting with ruining Ron & Hermione's budding romance. Also, they could've chosen a more cinematic way to interpret the book stranding the trio in the woods multiple times and the film score was unmemorable, though not as poorly done as HP5's. They at least did a good job setting up the finale by getting all of the boring parts out of the way, and I cannot dislike any movie with this much emotional investment, no matter how poorly it pays off in this particular instance.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 - Movie Reviews
1775,Hayden P,"Apr 09, 2021","So...I'd still say that the first half of the Deathly Hallows book is better than this movie.

It's not exactly perfect, but it is a good build-up to Part 2, and I'd still recommend Part 2 over this one any day.

1781,Smith T,"Mar 04, 2021","Well here we are... at the end of it all. I would like to first point out that the first 45 minutes of this film are a 10/10. They are truly some of the best minutes you'll watch in this entire saga. Now with all of that out of the way, I'm going to say what's on my heart. THE REST OF THE MOVIE IS BORING! Like wtf happened to the pacing? It's like it just gave up. One minute you're riding on the back of a dragon and then the next you're listening to someone talk about someone... talk about someone. This movie had a lot of great things going for it and then waste it as soon as they get out of act 1. And don't even get me started on the whole conflict between Harry, Hermoine and Ron. It feels so useless and unearned. It's literally a conflict for the sake of conflict. It isn't growth for anyone and it's on the boarders of character assassination for Ron. Like when they aren't all acting like assholes, the movie is actually able to move forward. The plot begins to progress and everything feels right again. But damn it if that feeling doesn't take a long time to appear. But yeah, as you can probably tell, that ""conflict"" is my biggest problem with the story. Well, that and pacing, but at least that doesn't make you gag. Other than those two things, the movie actually quite good. It's what I wanted in teh Half-Blood Prince that I didn't get. I definitely think if stopped watching it after HBP (like I almost did) then you should reconsider.

1808,Dale R,"Nov 15, 2021","A boy raised by wolves takes a walk through the jungle and happens upon animals with differing opinions on his well being. To the film's credit, it is wonderful to look at. Knowing that the only real thing we are looking at is Neel Sethi, who plays Mowgli, is truly a wonder for the time. All the animal characters look photo realistic. Casting Bill Murray as Baloo was a terrific idea. Ben Kingsley is great as Bagheera, Idris Elba plays a menacing Shere Khan and I love Scarlett Johansson's take on Kaa. Now here is the problem: they tried to keep the musical aspect of the original animated feature. I love the music from the original, I believe the music made that movie great. But here it is gutted from its intended purpose and is only included for nostalgic reasons. Scarlett Johansson's version of ""Trust In Me"" is great, but they only used it during the end credits because they needed her character to be an exposition dump. That is a terrible use of Johansson's talent and the money they spent for her studio time to voice Kaa.

Disney has remade its classic Jungle Book (1967) and turned it into a visual feast for the eyes. This movies special effects are so realistic, it’s hard to believe that nothing was shot on a set and it was all computer generated. The cast is complied of Hollywood’s finest actors and actresses, all lending their voices to these beautifully rendered computer generated animals. This film in my opinion delivers more emotion than the cartoon and also I think is a better movie than the original as well. This movie would suffer completely if the animals didn’t breathe and come to life the way they do.

1840,Cris K,"Jul 17, 2020","Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend. I'll honestly go as far as to recommend this over the original 1967 version. I don't think is quite as charming as the original, and it has a very different animation style, both with great quality of detail in it. From the individual strains of fur, to the types of animals included (I've done so much research on Indian wildlife today), you can really see the details of the cg effects. Just watch the end credit sequence alone, and it'll prove it. There are 3 huge improvements to this versus others: Sher Khan's face, King Louie, and the intensity of the animal fight scenes. The movie isn't free of problems: I imagine someone will have issues with talking animals vs non-talking animals, that he'd have to learn the language (so how would he ever understand Sher Khan or Baloo?). If anything, I think the writing took a hit. Where the original had a subtle but strong fables sequencing to it (sort of modular moral stories with shifting focus on characters), this is structured much closer to how many video game stories are structured, serialized chapters with some level of power creep and shifting focus of environment and goals but all focused on Mowgli. And I don't think the writing is bad, but this Jungle kid (never actually reveals his backstory, somewhat of a relief honestly) is performing clean engineering using vines and pulleys and armor (that wouldn't work) with calculated positioning. I understand that some people just have talent for some things, but I had to question whether or not I could do the same thing. I could, but I'd have to do it different ways. And in all fairness some of the stupid /inconsistent things he gets up too, even though he's a ""take charge"" Mowgli in this version really got to me: I was literally cheering for Sher Khan at certain points. Ultimately I had a good time with it, and I think most people and possibly their pets will too (my cats were interested for a while).",The Jungle Book,The Jungle Book - Movie Reviews

The voice cast is incredible, who bring plenty of charisma and energy to their roles, with the standouts being Bill Murray as Baloo and Idris Elba as Shere Kha.

I liked Jumanji when it came out in 1995 so, you can imagine my hesitation when I heard about this film. Expectations went up upon hearing Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson was going to be the lead. I love me some Dwayne Johnson man! This movie is an absolute blast to watch. It is entertainment first and foremost and yet it does add some much-needed characterization to some of these kids. I will admit that I wasn't a huge fan of the extreme stereotyped version of the kids at the beginning but, once the movie got going I understood why they did that. Overall, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a extremely fun movie that you can watch over and over again.

1852,Stephy S,"Sep 21, 2021","A short but sweet coming of age movie. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a solid action movie that plays it safe which is both its biggest strength and weakness. Most stuff in here is solid but nothing special, that being said, the cast is one of the best ensembles of A-list actors I've ever seen. From Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson to Karen Gillian to Kevin Hart and even Jack Black, every actor is a recognizable face and delivers on a phenomenal performance. Their chemistry is nothing to scoff at either as they all seem like high school students who only recently got to know one another. The special effects are also top-notch with some of the most gorgeous landscapes, intricate designs that translate beautifully into a 3D environment and some entrancing particle effects. One thing I don't like is the pacing, it felt like they had an actual plan for it but it fails miserably. The story structure is supposed to represent an action videogame but it just doesn't work on film in the slightest. The slower-paced, more emotionally driven scenes feel rushed and the action sequences feel rushed. Another thing this movie kinda misses the mark on is the tension. They wrote themselves into a corner with the life system they wrote so to get out of it, they just start taking them away for the sole of comic relief and having dire stakes. These things could've definitely benefitted from a revision or two. On the contrary, the soundtrack is an absolute blast! From the orchestral themes to the licensed songs, they're all excellent. It would've been a crime if they made a movie called ""Welcome to the Jungle"" and not have the infamous Guns 'n Roses in it!

In my opinion, though the battles and fantastical plot lines spark much excitement through the films, the real magic is between the characters throughout the franchise. You get the best of both worlds; a great fantasy plot, with queer relationships with depth and growth. Queer viewers rarely get both of those things, so the Hobbit is extremely rare in that respect. The Hobbit makes it clear that romance is not all about kissing, and that queerness travels between worlds.

While this movie has an amazing final 30 minutes the movie is quite hard to get through for the first 1 hour. This movie has the biggest struggle with the tone, as people are cracking jokes during the war... This movie is a fun final conclusion but it is never even close to becoming a fun final chapter. This movie also deals with a terribly paced movie, having extended scenes for no reason, and having a bland dialogue.

1927,Ryan S,"Feb 22, 2021","Exactly what it says on the tin - to a fault. Don't get me wrong, I like it. However, towards the end 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' definitely begins to drag quite heavily - the impact of what eventually happens did not, to be honest, hit as strongly as it could've/should've. The pure action is good, but there's not much to remember about everything else. None of the characters, with the exception of Richard Armitage (Thorin) and Luke Evans (Bard) I guess, stand out amidst the wall-to-wall battle. Martin Freeman (Bilb), Ian McKellen (Gandalf) & Co. are are of little importance really, which is a shame. 'The Hobbit' series, unfortunately, gets inferior as it goes by. Loved the first film, enjoyed the second but this third installment - while passable - leaves me with a feeling of wanting something else from it.

Once again Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Bill Nighy deliver outstanding performances. Tom Hollander as Cutler Beckett also deserves props, as does Keira Knightley who was allowed to shine more in this film. The final action sequence, while long, does provide excellent action and a very satisfying ending for all the characters. The special effects were well done and hold up to age well.

I am planning on buying the whole saga on bluray, but for now I saw the first on vhs and then the third on dvd and I had a very hard time believing it was a sequel to the excellent, enjoyable flick that is The Curse of the Black Pearl.

Elizabeth: A badass, portrayed beautifully by Keira Knightley. Barbossa: An extremely welcome addition. Davy Jones: A more interesting villain. Worldbuilding: Really interesting and creative. Story: A good follow up to Dead Man's Chest and I love the scale of the movie and I don't get why people say it's convolutef or confusing. It makes perfect pense and the movie really feels epic. Emotional weight: It lands with many deaths and a heartwarming finale for Elizabeth and Will. Beckett: More of a threat. Shch an underrated villain. Creativity: Through the roof. Entertaining: Definitely. There's a lot to like in this movie but there's also stuff I disliked. Length: Too long. Did not need to be 168 minutes long. Orlando Boom: Generally stiff performance and I'm not a fan of how Willmwas written. Pacing: not very good.

Finally, the effects and use of Smaug in this movie is something that surprised me with how well it was done.

It's much better paced with barely any boring moments, better choreographed action sequences especially the barrel sequences, it was cool seeing the ring having an influence on Bilbo and he once again has many great moments, Benedict Cumberbatch was an amazing Smaug (and that CGI is remarkable) and the scenes with him and Bilbo were so suspenseful, we got to see brand new locations in this movie, Tauriel was pretty awesome and once again, it absorbs you into the story of Middle Earth with great character moments and the stakes and suspense are higher and you feel that throughout the movie, this time for the actual world as we see Sauron's forces gathering and Suaron himself. Not to mention it's visually stunning. It's not perfect though. The romance with Tauriel and Killi is so forced and just weird (an elf and a dwarf?), it was annoying that we did not get to see much Gandalf and it's really convenient that Tauriel and Legolas arrived at LakeTown at the perfect time. Most of the dwarves are still forgettable The weakest part is the cliffhanger and it's not an Empire Strikes Back or Infinity War cliffhanger where it still felt like a complete story.

While an Unexpected Journey suffered from a slow pace, that had an uneven tone, this movie thrives off of the faster pacing, and better mixing of tone. The only downgrade is the script which does go down in quality in favor of the faster pacing and more thrilling sequences. As a sequel it does its job exceptionally well, building up characters, and raising the stakes. Only if this movie had a sharper script, I think this could have been an amazing watch.

The conclusion is what affects it the most, in my opinion. It isn't anything bad, but it goes on for too long - yet the ending itself comes out of nowhere a little. It's iffily crafted, with the entertainment value not enough to cover it up. Again, nothing anywhere near terrible... just not as great as I wanted/expected. I also kinda wanted more scenes with Martin Freeman (Bilbo) across the midway point. I like the focus on Richard Armitage (Thorin) & Co. but I felt there needed to be more with the lead - and with Ian McKellen (Gandalf), for that matter. I've led with my negatives first, but I have many positives too. I enjoyed the scenes in Esgaroth with Luke Evans (Bard), all of the stuff there looks awesome. The character of Tauriel, played by Evangeline Lilly, is cool. Orlando Bloom (Legolas) remains fun to watch. Everything else, including the score, is very nicely done - as anticipated.

Most notable by far were the film score, arguably the most memorable of the three movies, followed by the introduction of Gollum and the revolutionary CGI quality that came with him. The flaws in this one have the benefit of being made much worse by their expansion in the third movie, that being the deus ex machina and Frodo's transformation into a burdensome wuss, and even those could be considered more a gripe with the source material than the actual filmmakers.

As the Fellowship is broken, the remaining former members are separated into smaller groups which actually allows for some development for characters, whether they are important like Aragorn or more of a side character like Pippin. The Two Towers (2002) actually offers a lot more greater things than The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) with diving deeper into themes about the hypnosis the Ring provides as well as some huge scale battles, however the pace is a lot slower and more dialogue heavy than its predecessor, which at points can be really long to sit through.

2043,Puroo R,"Jun 21, 2021","The Lord of the Rings is one long story divided among three movies, which is the reason why it is hard to review this movie in itself. I have already written a review for The Fellowship of the Ring, in which I talked about how awesome the visuals of the story are, the philosophy behind the ring and the pop culture icon that it became. That is why I won't talk about those things in this review. Rather I will talk about the characters of the movie and why it has such a huge impact in the pop culture in spite of being nearly 20 years old book adaptation. Percy Jackson has done a really great job. The story picks up from the part where Gandalf was attacked, except this time it happens from the other point of view. This not only helps the viewer remember an incident that was important from the previous movie, but also makes it interesting by not showing the exact same shots again. While previously we believed Gandalf to be just a weak old man, over here he turned out to be a strong wizard. This is the reason why it paid off to see him return as Gandalf the White. The thing I really like aobut Gandalf is that he is a perfect balance of powerful and emotional character. In one moment he is being spun around by Saruman where he is crying like a frail old man, and in the very next scene he is fighting a fire dragon. In the first movie he scared Bilbo for a second by threatening him with magic if he dared to wear the ring, but immediately after he joined the Hobbits in the party. This is the trait which adds character depth to him, preventing him from being a two dimensional person. This way we get to see him from multiple perspectives. The second character I'd talk about here would be Gollum. The first time I saw him I thought he's just another one of those cringy skinny characters every fantasy movie needs to have (Jar Jar from Star Wars prequels, Dobby from Harry Potter etc). But he's very different. Earlier he was just a normal person like the rest of us. However, it was the temptation of the ring that completely ruined him, not just emotionally but physically too. Now in spite of his immortality he wastes himself searching for an addiction he has never been able to get away from. This is the reason why in spite of not actually wanting to hurt Frodo, he is unable to convince himself that what he is doing is actually wrong. This message is very clear in the scene where he is talking to himself. Speaking of the scene where Gollum talks to himself, that scene is one of the many scenes which is able to show the emotions that the characters wanted to express. This is something that can be done only by a good cinematography, which is something Peter Jackson was able to handle. Even though that scene is ridiculed, the point behind the scene was to show how Gollum was feeling while planning to kill Frodo and not how he was actually looking like. There have been plenty of scenes where the characters have conversations, but I don't want to spoil the movie for you. And that scene was interrupted by Sam, who is the next character I'd speak about. Sam is Frodo's best friend and he can go to any limits to make sure Frodo is safe. He is absolutely pure of mind, which was shown in the first movie when he stopped Frodo from wearing the ring. Sam had heard that Gollum wanted to kill Frodo and even though Gollum was the only one character who could actually help them reach the Mountain of Doom, Sam was ready to take the risk even if it meant having to get lost. Frodo didn't trust him or rather should I say, didn't WANT to trust him. And in spite of being abandoned by his best friend, Sam never wasted any time to get back to saving Frodo. The movie also has many battle scenes, cool CGI, shows the Fellowship of the Ring fight alongside other kingdoms while Gandalf is not there to protect them. The action, the comic timings, the CGI, the acting, everything about this movie is absolutely great. The only mistake I made watching this was that I watched the theatrical cut of this movie. Because of this I missed a very important (and cool) scene from the story, which I was thinking would be answered in Return of the King. It has something to do with Saruman. So don't make that mistake. I'd say you should watch the long one, no matter how much more you have to watch. The Two Towers is the most underrated movie of the trilogy and I really wish it was talked about more. Only those people know about it who have watched the trilogy. That doesn't mean it's bad. That just means this trilogy should be watched more. Since The Fellowship of the Ring is the beginning of the adventures and The Return of the King is the conclusion, The Two Towers never gets any appreciation as it is sandwiched between the two. But in reality it is the movie which bridges the two. It is an essential part of the movie since this is where the maximum amount of character development takes place.",The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers - Movie Reviews

The Uruk-Hai are menacing in this movie along with Saruman, he actually feels like a real threat along with his foot soldiers and you get the sense that anyone can die in all 3 of these movies, with the stakes being set at the end of Fellowship. But the bar is raised as King Theoden and the people of Rohan retreat to Helm's Deep where they fight what is undeniably one of the greatest battles in cinematic history.

2047,Will C,"Jun 06, 2021","(Extended edition) This one is always better than I remember it being. Definitely the black sheep of the trilogy. The extended cut isn't as good as Fellowship's in my opinion as there are too many extraneous scenes in this cut that only serve to stifle the pacing. The worst offenders are the additional scenes of Merry & Pippin which were already the slowest parts of the theatrical cut. In this cut we get entire scenes that are utterly pointless and barely add anything, as well as some more comedically focussed scenes that seem awkward and out of place in the overall film. There are other scenes that help flesh out and develop characters which I feel should have been included in the theatrical version. For example, we get a much better explanation of Aragorn's lineage and history in this cut which is very important given the key role he plays in the plot of The Return of the King. Overall, I feel the theatrical cut of this film is the superior, especially for a more casual viewer. It may gloss over some aspects, but the pacing is much better.

It's a pretty difficult feat to have a good character that everyone genuinely hates, not for being a badly written character, but because of how well she is written, and Umbridge was done perfectly - I'd say Umbridge is the best example of a well-written character made for everyone to genuinely loathe.

This time, the school got ransacked by the Ministry of Magic, and the students weren't allowed to practice magic. I knew that after the fourth one, this movie series would get more interesting and investing. And I was right. Now, Harry Potter got into deeper danger as his mentality started to decay as the movie went on. The school ransacking plot was pretty alright. It did make me want to see Harry Potter and his squad succeed and bring down the faculties. Most importantly, I appreciated that Harry was able to bond more with the other students, not just with the trio. They used a lot more magic, which was always fun to see. The best part of the movie was near the end, it was the first time that we saw a full-out battle between the wizards. The atmosphere was intense, and I enjoyed the lot of it. Overall, another thoroughly fun display of wizardry.

2073,Jordan M,"Apr 07, 2021","I found it very difficult to separate this viewing experience from reading the source material -- they had so much plot to condense that it ends up being nearly all that we're left with. There's a distinct lack of joy de vivre as it's a rather solemn, darkly-toned book and they minimized parts in the movie that were bright points in the novel, like excising Quidditch and spending very little time at Grimmauld place. The composer basically just being some guy the director knew was a shockingly poor decision as he was clearly unprepared for so important a movie, producing the worst film score in the entire franchise. The acting from Imelda and Bonham Carter was very impressive but particularly with the former it wasn't so magnificent that it had me enjoying scenes with her character in them; my nostalgia for this series is rooted in the very first movie where there's a thick air of whimsy and wonder, and thus I generally dislike most of the deviations from that atmosphere, with Umbridge being the prime example. The third act of this is still a sight to behold and the whole thing is thoroughly enjoyable to watch, but for me this rates among the bottom of the franchise in terms of entertainment value.",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - Movie Reviews

By far this fifth instalment is the weakest out of the bunch and I know that a lot of content from the original was cut out. Some of my biggest issues with the film are the first and second parts that drag, the characters actually getting annoying and the overall theme of the film not making sense. However, the last third of the film gets much better as the character dynamics have more development and the climatic wizard duel was really well done which saves this film a lot.

2083,Brady K,"Jan 05, 2021","This movie has one main issue but for me it's doesn't take away from the movie that much. This movie feels rushed, it has moments where it's jumping from one story lane to the next and it's poorly set up. As I've said many times I wish rotten tomatoes was out of 10 instead of 5 because for me it's a 8.5/10 but since it's out of 5 I have to give it a 4.5/5 because I don't feel it's as low as a 4/5. This movie has a lot going for it a very well written protagonist, Harry takes a leadership role and thrives, but my favourite is the big wizard fight it's was ver very entertaining. One of my big issues with the Goblet of fire is how they tried to dive further into the personal lives of the characters and it didn't work this time they found the sweet spot.

Non terribile in quanto sono del parere che nessun film di Harry Potter sia totalmente orripilante, ma questo è stato onestamente il film della saga che ho apprezzato meno (sia come trasposizione del libro che come film a sè stante).",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - Movie Reviews
2087,Luke J,"Dec 29, 2020","Order of the Phoenix makes a big jump forward in terms of increasing the stakes and taking the story into darker, more serious territory. Whereas Goblet of Fire primarily focused on the school experience of Hogwarts- this one makes it clear that the focus is more on the beginnings of the wizarding war. This movie is great because the consequences are real and lasting- unlike most of the previous Potter stories where all of our main characters emerge unscathed. The adult characters play a much larger role- Gary Oldman as Sirius Black is a standout performance, and the younger cast are now closer to being adults than children. The themes are also maturing, touching on politics with the failures and corruption in the ministry. Poor leadership, abuse of authority, and the necessity of a questioning, rebellious spirit is a strong thread throughout the entire movie. The last 30 minutes of this movie have some of the high points in the entire HP franchise. The fights between the Order & Death eaters are exciting and tense. The battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore is the best one on one fight in the entire series.",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - Movie Reviews

As Marlin goes on his journey and develops his character, the characters he meets are all memorable and iconic. The aquarium crew are all memorable as well.

I have come up with the concept of normie long before it was created. Other than that it was also because I came from a very conservative family. I was not allowed to watch movies in theatre, especially not a Hollywood one. So as all the kids used to talk about it I grew into hating it. And when this movie came on TV I only watched it with a critical point of view. It was only years after when I watched it and truly appreciated it. Finding Nemo is a very colourful movie filled with many sea creatures. It is an excellent movie that can teach children about the different types of marine life. I have heard about how everyone started hunting for clownfish after this movie came up. Although this is a bit sad and very cruel thing to do it also shows the impact that this movie was able to create and how much people enjoyed watching it. The fishes were shown in a very cute manner, especially the pufferfish. The only problem I have with this movie is the lack of a story. It's just a fish going from point A to point B. Although this does make for a good story since it helps in character development and world building, but these things should not be done while completely sacrificing a good story. I think I really like this movie and I will watch that once again to truly appreciate it.",Finding Nemo,Finding Nemo - Movie Reviews

But I feel like this movie has something stronger than those two movies combine: comedy. This might be the funniest movie that Pixar has ever made, it's definitely the one I quote the most by a good bit. Dory alone is good for at least 7 quality jokes.

Rupper and Daniel's performance looks very strange, I don't remember if it was like that in the book but it doesn't look good in my opinion. Finally, it is a very interesting story since we know a lot about the background of the story and if it is not the first time you see the saga, there are things that make a lot of sense.

The story takes away a large percentage of what made the novel so interesting, in order to shoehorn in a bloat to the romance plot-line between Harry and Ginny. However, even with this change, said romance is abysmal, and considering it's the main focus of the movie, there's bound to be issues. With color pallets seem to swap with every scene, a cast of characters with some of the most annoying performances in the series, this movie falls flat on its face. This is incredibly ironic considering that the director previously did Order of the Phoenix, and then went on to film both Deathly Hallows parts, and both Fantastic Beasts movies, all of which were great.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - Movie Reviews

2133,Sarvesh A,"Oct 04, 2021","This is my least favorite of the movies. Both because it is unfaithful to the book and just because its a bad movie. Now I'll admit, if I hadn't read the books first, I might not have hated it as much. But even by itself: its not a good movie. I first want to disclaim: I understand the filmmakers have to cut out stuff to make the movie. My favorite book of the series is Order of the Phoenix and thats a damn good movie as well, event though they did cut out a ton of stuff. Why? They knew what to cut and what to focus on. That isn't the case here. Firstly, Voldemort's backstory is one of the best parts of the entire series. The detail, the buildup and the rhyming between the young boy in the orphanage, the charming student, and the terrifying Dark Lord is brilliant. So what do they do? Cut out all of the memories of his past except the orphanage one. I can understand cutting some of the stuff but at least give us the Gaunt memories. That is crucial to the story of Voldemort and his Horcruxes. But nope. All that great stuff is cut out in exchange for completely unnecessary and downright cringeworthy stuff (I'll get to this later. Secondly, the freaking Half-Blood Prince? Y'know the title of this damn movie? He's basically an afterthought. How many times is the Half-Blood Prince ever brought up in the movie? Barely, and even when he is, he barely factors into the story and Harry doesnt develop any sort of connection with him. The reveal that its Snape is completely tacked on in the movie unlike the book where it was a gut punch. In the book, Harry starts to relate to the Prince, even seeing him as a friend, and defending him against Hermione's suspicions. He helped Harry through the entire thing and is what gave Harry the knowledge to save Ron's life. And then it turns out that the Prince was actually the man who he hated, that sold out his parents and got them murdered (another important thing cut from the movie), in Harry's eyes, got Sirius killed, and now murdered the greatest man he ever knew. But in the movie, its just like, oh wait, is that supposed to be important? Lets add that in here even though the Prince isn't important for 90% of the movie. I swear, it feels lie this movie was just in its own land and then at the end they realized ""oh wait we want to make a ton of money off the next movie so we have to set that up."" Thirdly, Harry and Dumbledore's relationship. Both actors gave a fantastic performance. Hell in this movie, all of them did. Its the writing thats on the wall here. Dumbledore feels more like a plot device than a character. In the book, we see Harry and Dumbledore's relationship strengthening following the conversation at the end of the 5th book where all the feelings were let out. Dumbledore basically replaces Sirius as his guardians and we really get to see how close they are especially with Harry telling the Minister of Magic he was ""Dumbledore's man through and through."" But we dont get to any of that here. Nope, instead we get a cringy romance drama. Now, you might be noticing a core problem with these issues: cut out in exchange for nonsense. The stuff above is what should've been in the movie and half the stuff in the movie should've been cut out. Instead of delving into Voldemort's backstory, and advancing the character of Snape, they decided to make this movie a romance drama. Its all over the place. They also added in completely out of nowhere scenes like the Burrow burning which should've been serious but had no consequences... because it wasn't in the book at all and they realized they had to set up the seventh chapter. Thats a good chunk of screen time. Cut out all the unnecessary teenager drama, for God's sake. Was there drama in the book? Absolutely. But it was the subplot not the main plot. And it was handled a lot more seriously and/or better than it was in the movie. The drama serves the story, not the other way around, which is what the movie did. And thats the main problem with this movie. It focuses on the wrong stuff. All the melodrama, that sound be the stuff brought up here and there rather than being the main plot, the Half-Blood Prince and Voldemort's origins should be the main story. The screenwriters had this completely backwards. Yes, they would have to cut some of the good drama from the book... but thats okay. Like I said, I get that they have to cut stuff. They just cut the wrong stuff. But even then, if they handled the stuff they wanted to focus on well, I could call it a day and say its disappointing but overall a good movie. But they didnt. They even failed on all the drama they wanted to get across. If you want to make feelings and conflicts of interest the main story, at least do it well. But they even failed at that. Thee biggest example of this is Ginny and Ron. Now its pretty clear David Yates was someone who shipped Harry and Hermione from both the 6th and 7th movies. That doesnt mean you ruin other characters to get that done. I do think overall they did Ron worse than Ginny, but thats more in the 7th one. In this movie, it was Ginny that was ruined. In the books, Ginny was a sassy, confident, powerful girl who could stand up for herself and had a lot of nerve. Harry's feelings for her are built up throughout most of the book. Starting with a brief mention on the Hogwarts Express when he's unhappy that Ginny is sitting with Dean alone on the train and kicking off the plot with the scene after Quidditch practice. The drama between all the characters is very well handled in the book. In one scene, Rowling sets up grudges and building anxiety that really develop the main characters for the rest of the book. I'm of course talking about the scene where Ron and Harry run into Ginny and Dean kissing, which is where Ron's inner self-hate and jealousy as well as his insecurities are triggered by his younger sister and he finds out about Krum & Hermione, which sets up his story for the book, as well as the first time Harry realizes he likes Ginny. Unlike in the movie, they do care about Ron in the book, and Harry's inner conflict is between his feelings for Ginny and how his best friend would react if he was in Dean's place that day. Harry's feelings keep building, and later in the book, they start dropping hints that Ginny likes him as well. Ron also has a great journey where his core problem is observed: lack of self-confidence. Finding out about Hermione and Krum only made him hate himself worse, and when the Quidditch match came around and he won, he finally for the first time in his life could be proud of himself. Especially when he found out that he did it all himself, there was no Felix Felicis in his drink. He became confident, and that caused him to start becoming a jerk. Take somebody who has lacked power all their life, hated themselves for their weakness, and felt every time they were bullied, it was deserved because of weakness. And if you give them power, you'll create a greater monster than you ever could've imagined. Power in this case is self-confidence. His entire life, Ron's been overshadowed by his brothers, teased for his poorness, living in the shadow of his best friend, and now for the first time in his life, he's the one with all the attention, everyone loves him, he gets a self-confidence boost and THATS what causes him to be so horrible to Hermione. It takes a near death experience to break him out of this arrogant streak and ultimately, he becomes better as a person because of the experience. Both of these journeys come to a climax in this passage: ""We won!!"" yelled Ron, bounding into sight and brandishing the Silver Cup at Harry. ""We won! Four Hundred and Fifty to a Hundred and Forty! We won!"" Harry looked around; there was Ginny running towards him; she had a hard blazing look on her face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her. After several long moments — or it might have been half an hour — or possibly several sunlit days — they broke apart. The room had gone very quiet. Then several people wolf whistled and there was an outbreak of nervous giggling. Harry looked over the top of Ginny's head to see Dean Thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand and Romilda Vane looking as though she might throw something. Hermione was beaming, but Harry's eyes sought Ron. At last he found him, still clutching the cup and wearing an expression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head. For a fraction of a second they looked at each other, then Ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that Harry understood to mean, ""well — if you must."" This is the culmination of both their journeys. Harry finally acts on his feelings and Ron, who would've been angry if this happened at the beginning, after everything he's gone through, gives Harry his approval. THATS how you do drama well. And here's where I talk about why its just a bad movie. Instead of following the wonderful example set by the book, the writers of the movie decided to rush the relationships, remove any inch of explanation of Ron's inner journey and just have him be a terrible person in general that the perfect Hermione forgives immediately, and completely butchers Ginny's character. Ginny is for some reason in the movie still a shy little girl with a crush on Harry not having ever developed since the second book. The relationship between Harry and Ginny is rushed, and has some of the most cringeworthy scenes in any movie. The shoelace scene for one or pretty much any interaction they have. Its unwatchable. They rush the journey to get there, and do nothing afterwards. Seriously, there's nothing between them getting together and the end of the movie. All the added stuff with McLaggen & Hermione was pointless and stupid. I was actually okay with the Lavender stuff because Ron & Lavender were supposed to be portrayed as toxic. But I think they over exaggerated some of the scenes. In addition, if you need any more evidence, the moviemakers hate Ron, they gave his two best moments to Hermione. When he gives Harry his approval, and when he tells him they're coming with him wherever he's going to find the Horcruxes. Other things I didnt like: Dumbledore's funeral was not as impactful as it should've been. They did do something creative but they failed to describe how much Dumbledore meant to Harry and what it meant for Harry and the Wizarding World now that he was gone. They also cut out the fantastic scene where Harry is forced to push Ginny away from getting close to him, but at that point, they buried ship that so far there wouldnt have been any point. But two things they should've definitely kept: One, The Battle of the Hogwarts. The first one to be specific. In the book, when Harry ran down the Astronomy tower, cursing Death Eaters after Dumbledores death, he ran into a massive battle between the Death Eaters and the combined forces of Dumbledores Army and the Order of the Phoenix. Every character has a role, and afterwards, all the threads of the magnificent conspiracy by Malfoy and the Death Eaters are revealed, brilliantly tying up every plot point in the book. The Battle would've been so cool to see. Instead... we get nothing except Bellatrix laughing maniacally (I do have to say though, Bellatrix's actress is freaking fantastic, she has so much fun in the role and plays the woman that enjoys being evil so well that I understand them adding her into scenes she wasn't originally in and have no complaints there). Additionally, I hated how Harry kind of liked the fame he got in this movie. That is quintessentially against Harry's character. He HATES being famous, he hates being swarmed by people wanting to get near him all the time. Thats why its so meaningful when he uses that on Slughorn. Thats the only time he ever uses fame to his advantage, and he did it so that his mothers sacrifice wasnt in vain. But in the movie, he kinda likes being famous. The biggest example of this is when Hermione is trying to protect him from people trying to slip him love potions and tells him ""they only care about you know because you're the Chosen One."" And Harry says ""But I am the Chosen One."" That too, very pompously. That isn't Harry, its James. Harry would never say that. The real Harry would've been annoyed that Hermione didnt do more to stop the potions from being snuck and Hermione would never have needed to tell him that Harry wouldve either said or thought that himself. Oh wait, hold on. That is what happened in the book. They also completely cut Tonks from the movie, which was kinda annoying. Finally, Sirius's death had practically no repercussions. In the book, Harry is heavily hit by Sirius's death and spends all summer alone and refusing to eat, barely talking to anyone. So much of the first act includes the impact of losing his godfather on Harry. But in the movie, its almost as if Sirius's death never happened. He was there and now he's not. This movie is a dumpster fire. I didnt like the Goblet of Fire movie but at least they did the Graveyard Scene, the most important part of the movie right. It was so well adapted and shot faithfully to the epicness of the original scene that it nearly made me forgive them for completely dropping the ball on the Barty Crouch twist and a lot of other parts of the movie. At least the Goblet of Fire got the characters right, and while I dont think they did a good job with the mystery at all and ruined one of the best twists in the series, they knew what to cut for the most part and didnt sideline the main plot of the book. This movie fails to meet the very low standard of that movie. It hits very few good beats, fails with 3/4 of the main plots of the book, treats the darkest chapter of the series like a complete romantic comedy, and inserts stupid scenes that were never in the book which were either out of character, cringeworthy, or unnecessary with no repercussions. However, there are a few redeeming factors. Firstly, the acting. But sadly, not even great acting can save a bad script. Secondly, the plot with Malfoy was very well done and easily the best part of the movie. Thirdly, the effects are fantastic. And finally, they at least did the cave scene well.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - Movie Reviews

I don't have as much nostalgia for it as I do some of the others but it's inarguably the most complete movie of the lot, with absolutely perfect pacing (allusions toward the cabinet-related finale sprinkled in from near the very beginning), highly likeable new characters, a series-best level of comedy and a heavy focus on the three best side characters of the series with Snape & Dumbledore's parts expanded and Draco suddenly made at least 4x cooler than he was in the previous movies. Rickman, he of the dulcet intonations, is at his absolute peak with this one. They brought back Quidditch when it'd been sorely lacking from the previous two movies and they kept a healthy running time that allowed important scenes to breathe and be taken in by the audience. Most surprising of all was that the same man who'd put forth the worst film score of the franchise with HP5 returned and gave us a score that I felt was arguably on par or even superior to Williams's score for HP1; it was heavily bolstered by his use of Williams's themes, of course, but Hooper's felt more distinctive and it seemed to better match the atmosphere of each scene. My sole knock is that I wasn't quite as impressed by the cinematography as AMPAS was; I'm not a big fan of tinting an entire scene one color or the other and they do a ton of that here.

I had read the books and thought my disappointment with the movies was because there'd just be no way for a movie to live up to the books. Now I'm in the process of reading the books to my own children. They also want to see the movies, and so I'm treating myself to another round of the Harry Potter series to get a better handle on they will be able to handle the visual re-imagining of the story. I realise I can now better summarise why I think the movies fail. Although in this instance I'm talking about the Half-Blood Prince, the main problem seems to more or less affect all the movies. The heart of the matter is poor adaptation and screenwriting. Instead of wholesome stories, the movies feel like quick visual summaries of events that take place in the books on fast-forward. The Half-Blood Prince rockets along from one location and key event to the next without providing the due context for what is taking place. It's as if the writers of the movie knew that people would fill in what was missing from their memory of the book ...but that's not how a movie is supposed to work! A movie is supposed be able to stand on its own. It really is an art form to be able to condense a large story into one and a half-hours or maybe two. At two hours and thirty minutes, this monster still somehow feels poorly paced and rushed. The movie is like a malnourished overweight person. Plenty of mass, but little substance.

Ya la película al inicio tiene un excelente montaje musical con Accidentally In Love y ya para el final tiene la inolvidable escena con I Need a Hero; aunque también en general la película tiene un soundtrack increíble. El humor es muy inteligente y gracias a eso la película puede resultar muy entretenida también para los adultos y para todo el público en general. Los personajes son los mejores, desde el primer momento te encariñas con ellos y los personajes nuevos hacen que la película sea mucho mejor, son muy memorables todos; entre ellos el mejor villano de la saga que es el hada madrina. Por otro lado, el doblaje sigue siendo demasiado bueno sobretodo en español latino, creo que uno de los mejores doblajes que se hicieron. La animación sigue siendo excelente y obviamente supera a su antecesora. En conclusión, una muy buena secuela y mejor que su antecesora, me sorprende realmente que no haya ganado el Oscar como lo hizo la primera ya que para mi es la mejor de la franquicia, pero eso no le saca el puesto de una de las mejores películas de animación de la historia.

2184,Puroo R,"Jul 11, 2021","As a kid I hated Shrek. But after seeing it for the first time a few years ago, I decided that I really liked Shrek. I had to go on a vacation soon after finishing the first movie, so right after coming back I proceeded to watch the next one. And I think it's probably because of the trip or something, but I actually liked Shrek 2 more. There are many reasons why I feel this one is clearly superior to the first one, and why this is my favourite sequel among any movie (other than Lord of the Rings and The Dark Knight trilogies of course). The movie begins with the part where Shrek 1 ended. Shrek and Fiona are happily married and live their ogre lives in peace. The reason why this movie works so well is because unlike regular sequels, this one actually expanded on what could happen in future. If this was a conventional sequel it would have shown that Lord Farquaad has come back somehow and now he has joined forces with some other villain to beat them. Also some random characters would have been introduced while others would have been killed. The movie simply begins with the feeling of an adventure. Shrek, Donkey and Fiona going to Far, Far Away to meet Fiona's parents who have never seen her in the last 20 years, that's a perfect story. Remember how we thought about Shrek and Fiona before the first movie? We changed our minds for the better after we watched the movie and learnt a lesson. Fiona's parents, however, have still not seen that happen. And this is something Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming take the advantage of. The reason why this movie worked but the next two didn't was because this movie never dragged any concept. Shrek and the fairy tale characters became friends, Shrek and Donkey saved Fiona, they fell in love and married. Period. This was never 'revised' upon. Rather either the consequences of those actions or the other aspects of life were shown. Every scene looked interesting for some reason. It's almost like the creators poured all their love in every scene. No scene feels like they were just trying to get over it. Every moment is cherished: Fiona crying, Shrek meeting Puss, Shrek's friends watching TV - everything is memorable. Shrek 2 is how a sequel should be. It should give us exactly what we wish to know. It does not force any character, it does not force any scene. Everything that is introduced in this movie, every joke that takes place happens within the audience's interest. I really wish if a new Shrek movie is made, they make it like this. Shrek is meant to be something that is remembered for all time, not a meme. It's one of the most iconic 3D animated movies I've ever seen.",Shrek 2,Shrek 2 - Movie Reviews

2212,Billy R,"Nov 07, 2021","The story of Freddie Mercury is a tragic and hard-edged story about a immigrant gay man who did drugs and died of AIDS. The way this movie tells this story comes off as hollow and sanitised, there is so much inaccurate stuff in this movie like the fact that Queen broke up as a band because they were upset that Freddie Mercury got a deal for a solo album which upsets the band in the movie which never happened in real life because Roger Taylor released a solo album in the late 70s early 80s and in the movie Freddie Mercury tells the band he has AIDS a week before Live Aid in 1985 although he wasn't diagnosed until 1987.

Are we supposed to feel sympathy with the band who need to comply with his antics? Or take inspiration for how energised and on-board they are with his creative direction? The film flirts with the underlying tragedy of his private life and the illness that inevitably claims his life, but keeps it at arm's length to prevent the audience from getting sad when there's rock music to enjoy. So it's a good film but not an excellent one. Rami Malek is astonishing though, without question.",Bohemian Rhapsody,Bohemian Rhapsody - Movie Reviews

2231,Parker E,"Jul 02, 2021","It isn't terrible, I guess. I like Queen's music. Why does this movie have auto tune and lip syncing over the original recordings and not new recordings by Rami Malek unlike Taron Edgerton in Rocketman. I think it is really funny that the members of Queen get mad because they have to lip sync on tv but then they lip synced all the singing in this movie. The editing in this movie is terrible. How did this movie win an Oscar for best editing? I do not understand. They always say that Freddie is drunk or high but they never show him getting drunk or high, unlike Rocketman. The best way to describe it is that this movie is very sanitized and safe. The movie doesn't go into the real side of Freddie at all. The movie is also not factually accurate. Freddie got diagnosed with AIDS in 1987 but in the movie he gets diagnosed before the Live Aid concert which was in 1985. Rami Malek's performance is pretty good though. I liked the lawyer/manager character. The music is great but that has nothing to do with this movie. I do really like the Live Aid scenes though. The Live Aid scenes are definitely the best part of the movie hands down. I just find the Live Aid concert really cool and fascinating. I also believe Live Aid was probably the best concert ever. The story, being a true story is pretty interesting so I liked the story told in the movie. In conclusion, John Reid is a terrible person, lip syncing is bad, this movie is disappointing and mediocre but not the worst movie ever by any means and Rocketman is way better. I will say Rocketman is so much better, it's not even a competition. Bohemian Rhapsody wishes it was even near as good as Rocketman.",Bohemian Rhapsody,Bohemian Rhapsody - Movie Reviews

Maybe some scenes are created to move the story along. This is not a biopic. Most of the movie is simply invented by the writers and director. For example, Freddie didn't meet the other band members behind a van after their show; they were already roommates. There was no backlash against the Bohemian Rhapsody song; everyone loved it at the start. The band wasn't inspired to perform at Live Aid by Freddie's courage in the face of AIDS; he wasn't diagnosed with that until two years after that show. The movie at all times is heading towards that Live Aid performance, which was recreated shot for shot with the original footage.

2273,ANDERSON G,"Aug 22, 2021","Peter jackson is one of the best directors in terms of good budget use, the director probably learned that in his early career directing great trahs movies, and in ""The Lord of the Rings"" it's no different, peter makes a film of almost 4 hours grand, with impeccable costumes and makeup, great visual effects for the time and a wide range of magnificent backdrops and screen compositions, by comparison, the same year also came out Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone which cost 38 million more, although ""The Lord of the Rings"" seems much more expensive. I didn't read the classic JRR Tolkien book to know how it was transposed to the screen, but even with a long film time, we have zero waste, we have a story that constantly grows, full of arcs and a past that transports mythology, all of this combined with a classic and very well constructed hero arc that unfolds in a great intro drama, the film has four acts and a short last act that already leaves a plot for the sequel. The entire art direction of the film is exquisite, the feature film, which is already over 20 years old, leaves some special effects dated, it's true, but at the time it was very surprising and still convinces today, especially in its costumes and makeup, which are still great today. , photography and the use of the green background still work reasonably well, and the soundtrack is a show on its own, showing the inner emotion of each nucleus through its melodies. Peter Jackson works well not only the visual and script factor, but also works the small layers, such as obsession, fear and overcoming, and also knew how to squeeze the most out of his cast of actors, taking magnificent performances, such as de Ian McKellen for example. The film is very well worked in its most diverse layers, every shot is very well executed and formidable, the weakest point perhaps is the lack of coherence, violence and the sobriety tone of the work, which changes its state of mind constantly, but these are details that do not bother this work at all, which amuses, entertains and enchants to this day.

Hasn't that already happened I hear you ask. Well, yes, and here's the proof; Peter Jackson's first instalment of his staggering trilogy, and arguably the best of the three (although my opinion on that changes daily).

2285,Cameron K,"Aug 12, 2021","Well... I'm afraid that this movie is by far the most disappointing film that I've ever sat down to watch. I came in with the greatest of expectations, as I've seen countless amazing reviews, articles, and even been directly told of the praise that this movie ""deserves"". How it's ""better than the book"", ""truly riveting"", ""the greatest action movie to date"", and so on. However, I simply cannot agree with any of those claims. I think Peter cheapened much of the story, even beyond that of what's expected from compressing 423 pages down to 178 minutes worth of film *I watched the theatrical version*. Since this review is already getting very long I'm going to list out the changes that Peter made that I think were for the worse. -Merry was re-written to become a Pippin part 2, which is especially terrible since in the original story they were quite different. Merry starts out responsible and leader-like then has to deal with feelings of loneliness and usefulness. While Pippin starts out naive and mistake-ridden then learns to become responsible and valiant. -Elrond and Galadriel are very dislikeable. I could smell their superiority complex through my screen. -Gandalfs already 'not perfectly' written pre-fellowship journey becomes even worse. Like why go to Saruman before safely escorting the Hobbit to Rivendell? Why not go help the Hobbit directly after getting to Rivendell? What happened to the letter? -Aragorn and Gandalfs relationship is too mysterious. You don't see them interact with each other much, Gandalfs speaks of no importance with Aragon, and all that makes Aragorn's presence at the prancing pony even more convenient. Furthermore, why weren't the Hobbits more suspicious of him when they met? -Nazgul nerfed? Why was Aragorn able to solo 5 of the Nazgul with nothing but a sword and torch? In the book, they quickly fled because they thought that Frodo had no chance at surviving the wound, but in the movie, they stayed to fight with Aragorn for a bit before getting chased out because Aragorn was destroying them. -The Gandalf v Saruman fight was maybe the worst fight scene I've ever seen from such a big movie. Force pushing each other around with sticks, how exciting. -Elves were just cringy, with the blurring filter and ugly language, it was just too much. -Legolas, Gimli, and Boromir were less explained. In the books Legolas comes to tell about Golums escape, Gimli comes to discuss Saurons offer to the Dwarves on the lonely mountain, and Boromir comes to find counsel on his and Faramir's dreams. But in the movie, they are just there because they are important figures in their kingdoms. Although I have plenty of gripes with the movie I think it still did a fine job. I thought the production quality was outstanding, even for 2021's standards. I also like that Arwen became more prevalent in the story, although her being the one sent to help Aragorn and the Hobbits makes no sense but exploring her and Aragorn's relationship early on was a definite plus to the story. So overall I don't think it's bad but it stacks nowhere near the original story and I can't believe that anyone can say otherwise, but I seem to be in the minority so maybe I'm just wrong.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring - Movie Reviews

2292,Jonathan K,"Oct 07, 2021","There are a lot of neat concepts on display in this movie, and as such, it's a real shame that more aren't done with them. This movie is 157 minutes long, and only the last 10 minutes actually amounted to anything. The rest of it is a self-contained story that has very little in the ways of actual plot, and the big reveal at the end ultimately negates half of what came before, as it turns out that a good chunk of it was a ruse (but not in the ultra-satisfying way as something like Hot Fuzz or the first Saw). Throw in the fact that the movie is also darker and murkier than the other entries, before and since, and the very mediocre performance by Robert Pattinson (already one of the most over-valued people in the industry). The mystery element involving David Tennant's character, Harry Crouch Junior, is really the only thing of real interest beyond the end, but it never actually amounts to anything either, as the audience already knows that he's evil, and once he's found out, his story ends literally seconds later.. All in all, the movie isn't 'bad' by any means - it's just almost entirely meaningless in the grand scheme of things, and honestly, it's just self-indulgence that this movie was a solid hour longer than it needed to be.",Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Movie Reviews

The plot is about the Triwizard tournament, where each school's representative battled for the glory. But somehow Potter was chosen as the fourth contestant, and we have ourselves a fun and intense story. I was surprised and happy that I wasn't bored through another two and a half hours of this franchise. This is the first one that kept my interest throughout. Again, there were more unique wizard stuff that further expanded the universe. This was always fun to watch, and this movie still kept that tradition going. The first half actually was teen drama where the students went to a ball. The romance was more prominent, and even became naughty in some scenes. What drove the plot was the tournament, and the looming danger that hid beneath it throughout the runtime. When the imminent doom hit at around the last round of the tournament, the movie became vastly more intense. For the first time, I felt that Harry's life was in actual danger. As for problems, the runtime was still a tad bit long. Also, some of the rounds in the tournament were pretty weak an could have been more fun.

2321,Jordan M,"Apr 05, 2021","Newell did more things right here than Cuaron did with the third movie and it's not even close. He makes the most out of the lengthy runtime here by excising a lot of the subplots in the novel in an extremely successful way as it allowed more time to be spent on the climactic finale than had been allotted in any of the previous 3 movies. There was more interaction between the characters and a highly appreciable increase in comedy. The actors had grown up quite a lot and were doing better in each iteration at showing their acting range, with Hermione a particular highlight in this one. Doyle acquitted himself remarkably well, with his film score on par with Williams's previous three and the CGI had improved drastically even with only a year's time passing. Best of all was the source material itself as the underdog sports genre is probably my #1 favorite and the finale here is probably the best in the entire series, both the graveyard part and the quasi-epilogue reveal. I think Cuaron misunderstood the intended audience for these as his priorities seemed rooted solely in quality filmmaking instead of entertaining a mostly-teenaged audience, a concept Newell is apparently an expert at. The only criticism I have is that I think they could've found a few minutes to devote to the Quidditch World Cup instead of skipping the entire thing as that was one of the best chapters in the book!",Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Movie Reviews

2324,Swetha G,"Mar 18, 2021","The non-so magical review from a muggle. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a fantasy/adventure film directed by Mike Newell. It is based on J.K.Rowling's novel which was written in 2000 and carries the same name as the novel. It was released on November 23, 2005. It is as well the fourth part in the Harry Potter film series. Last Christmas, I saw this film and it was definitely one to remember. Just like past Harry Potter films this one didn't fail to amuse me. You could tell that this was filmed on a big-budget compared to the previous films of the series. To my mind I think this one offers a lot more than fantasy or adventure, it also gives you a lot of headspace to imagination. This piece of art surely left me astonished and filled with questions, wanting to watch the next part. As for the plot of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, it includes the three main characters to be grown up, as they enter their fourth year of the School of Wizardry and Witchcraft: Hogwarts. It holds a fair amount of violence, since Harry Potter, the main character has to enter the prestigious Triwizard Tournament as a minor and face some dreadful challenges along the way of becoming a champion. Throughout the film, new characters came to light. Some added a romantic aspect to the film, whereas others did not. For the 14-year-old Harry Potter, he endures pressure a normal teenager cannot handle to confront his biggest nightmare. With the help of his dearest friends, Hermione and Ron, he doesn't fail to succeed in the period of the tournament. After all, this is the year students prepare for the Yule Ball and dare to ask female students as their date to the ball. Yet, the charming part of the film quickly ends there, as Harry Potter will live up to his title as ‘The Boy Who Lived'. The Harry Potter series is known to leave every person astounded who is into fiction and/or fantasy. As for me, it was always a surprising experience watching through these films, as you notice the characters growing up from a young child to an adult. There is no doubt that J.K. Rowling is by far one of the most influential writers in our century. Not only, did she write several successful books but stands as a role model for young children and women. With the apparent cliffhanger at the end of the first film, it will leave you wanting more and you will end up watching the next films that follows up on the previous one. Personally, I am a lover of anything fictional, which is obvious why I am a fan of Harry Potter. Behind the success of these series, I suppose that watchers admire the films as they are not predicable as much as you think it would be. For instance, in this film, it gets quite dark quickly once you watch Harry get involved into life-or-death situations. Another example, is that Harry experiences tons of emotions in this film. As he goes through happy moments with his friends, he goes through the same amount of unknown moments and feelings. However, I must say that this is perhaps the most significant Harry Potter film so far. Mainly because, while I was watching this part of the series it felt like a mix of genres. Also, another example to why this film doesn't have a sole boring moment since it will keep introducing new characters throughout. For the Triwizard Tournament I mentioned earlier, there will be a ton of new, yet interesting characters added who bring a value to these films, which also was an enjoyable aspect. Lastly, this film was not excessively long but definitely long enough to tell the story. But there is one negative detail, that the films don't fully cover every single detail like the books do. So if you want to have a full understanding experience, I suggest you to also read the books so that you don't miss out on other details. Clearly, this masterpiece will be a hard one to forget, as it will stick to you for a longer time. It is not something that you will be able to forget soon, as it so famous. I would recommend this film to anyone who might be interest in fantasy and fictional characters. Furthermore, it is important to watch them in chronological order, since every film leaves a cliffhanger at the end which follows up on the next one. Lastly, I hope you get lost into the imagination of the magical world of Harry Potter, just like I did.",Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Movie Reviews

Something that this tape owed me was a better participation of Ron, since the appearance of Voldemort and Cedric totally overshadowed him, and they also made his character a bit like a crybaby and gossip, and I did not like that much.",Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Movie Reviews
2327,Hoan D,"Mar 06, 2021","Summary: This movie marks an important cornerstone in the development of the Harry Potter universe with the return of the Dark Lord Voldemort. It is set in Hogwarts during the fourth year of school, when the Triwizard Tournament takes place. It is a traditionally a competition between the three prominent schools of magic including Hogwarts, Durmstrang and Beauxbatons. Prior to the competition, the Goblet of Fire selects three students from each school to participate in the contest. Harry is unexpectedly selected and forced to enter the competition by the Goblet of Fire with three other students even though he never put his in the cup and he is also underage. Later, it is found out that one of the Voldemort's underlings cast an advanced spell on the Goblet to deceive it of Harry's age. During the first three rounds of the contest, Harry and the other students have to complete many difficult tasks such as rescuing underwater and fighting dragons. The climax of this movie comes when the four students compete to get out of the maze, the last round of the contest. However, Voldemort, still in his feeble from between dead and alive, and his underlings are in there waiting for the four, eventually killing Cedric from Hogwarts. Harry, after that, is capture, and his blood extracted and used to rebuild Voldemort into a strong physical form. Harry then duels against the Dark Lord for his life. He barely escapes Voldemort and eventually brings Cedric's body back to campus with the knowledge that Voldemort has returned. Analysis: The important turn of events in this movie heralds major change development of the storyline and the journey of Harry Potter as the main hero in this series. Harry is now no longer inherently safe from Voldemort like before when Harry's blood was has the magic against the Dark Lord. Now, both share the same blood as he used his Voldemort used Harry's blood to revive himself. Harry no longer is protected and now susceptible. He is now more representative of real-life heroes, who actually have vulnerabilities, not inherently indestructible by enemies as Harry used to be earlier in the series. This sharing of blood between Harry and Voldemort is also symbolistic of the struggles that real-life heroes have. It is like a connection across the dichotomy of good and evil, signaling the heroes also have their own evil side that they struggle against. Furthermore, when Harry's friend Ron turns against him, it further depicts Harry as a misunderstood hero. Ron estranged himself from Harry because Ron thinks that Harry intentionally enters himself into the contest for fame. However, later in the movie, Ron actually helps Harry to get through one of the dangerous rounds of the contest where the four students had to compete underwater. Ron's actions actually saved Harry's life. This part of the stories highlights the resilience of true friendship. No matter how significant the misunderstanding is, true friends will still help each other when in need and resolve the problem between them. Then when the four enter the last round of the tournament, the maze, Cedric encounters a minion of Voldemort, he is murdered by the killing curse. Then, Harry is captured by the other underlings of Voldemort. His arm is cut, and his blood collected to revive Voldemort. Harry has to duel against him for his life. He almost loses against the newly rejuvenated and strengthened Dark Lord. However, the souls of Harry's loved ones who were murdered by Voldemort appear from Voldemort's wand and give Harry's time to get to the Portkey to escape the maze. This scene demonstrates the theme of love's triumph over hate and evil. Critique: I love this movie and the whole Harry Potter series as a whole. There are, nonetheless, certain details that I think can be improved upon. The first one is rather a minor detail. It is when Dumbledore finds out the Goblet of Fire has chosen Harry as the fourth selectee to enter the tournament. The book says that Dumbledore ‘calmly' asks Harry if he actually put his name into the Goblet. However, the corresponding scene in the movie portraits Dumbledore's asking as aggressive and intimidating when he grabs Harry's arms and shakes them while questioning him. This minor detail, although does not affect the structural integrity of the storyline, somehow momentarily breaks the usual portrayal of Dumbledore as a gathered and calm man without serving any significant purpose. The second detail is when Harry is forced to enter the Tournament. J.K Rowling here could have better explained why it is that way, because the audience may have questions such as the following: Why is an underage forced to enter such a perilous contest even when he does not want to? Or Why can't/doesn't the administration do anything to keep Harry from the having to enter? Explanations to these questions can further strengthen the integral structure of the storyline. Overall, despite these small details that may be improved, I still give the movie 5 out of 5 stars.",Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Movie Reviews

2329,Leobardo V,4d ago,"The worst movie out of the trilogy, but really over hated. The reasons why people hate this movie is understandable, Peter Parker seems to have regressed on his love life which was developed and was seemed to be great as how the second movie ended, but in this film Peter Parker makes some decisions that make him a bad person when it comes to love and makes Mary Jane Watson feel not feel appreciated. Mary Jane Watson story is really not that good in this film they make her really dependent of a guy which in the comics, video-games, and TV shows/cartoons Mary Jane has always been an independent woman that takes care of herself most of the time. Villain wise this movie is also mid, out of the 3 villains, we only had one going into detail of why he was bad and why he took some decisions that made him a villain but only one had great character development and that was Sandman, for the other villain (New Green Goblin) we have had a background story of why he became a villain since the first film but to be fair they did do a good gob towards the end when it comes to that character. The main villain and the worst one is Venom, man came out of nowhere and managed to get into Peter Parker's apartment so easily without him realizing. Venom was a rushed character in this film, no background, man just landed on Earth from space and he only turned Peter Parker more into an anti-hero when Peter was his host but no interactions between Peter and Venom, also something to add, Venom turned into a suit which Peter easily took off and when Peter realized what was happening to him with Venom he struggles to take off his suit, makes no sense to me unless Venom realized Peter wanted him away so he just tried to stay with him. Once Venom reached Eddie Brook, it was more comic accurate but still a wasted villain nothing compared to the new Venom movies we have today. This movie is enjoyable but it is average at best compared to the other films.",Spider-Man 3,Spider-Man 3 - Movie Reviews
2330,Aidan B,5d ago,"A massive disappointment compared to the classic first two, ""Spiderman 3"" has a much shakier and convoluted story that tries to cram too much into its short runtime. The action is still pleasant, though the CGI somehow feels worse than the previous films. The villains are still good and memorable, though there are just too many to give any of them their time to shine. The direction that this film heads in is also very confusing, rewriting some important plot points and actions of the previous two films. Maguire, Dunst, and Franco are still very well in this movie though, and the acting of the villains is also on point. There are also a number of entertaining sequences, though most get overshadowed by the large amount of cringey and unnecessarily bad moments that make no sense. Overall, just a bad film that fails to conclude the ending that the previous installments deserved.",Spider-Man 3,Spider-Man 3 - Movie Reviews
2331,Martin F,6d ago,"The trilogy ends on a confusing note. It's a really hard film to follow, there is so many stories here and all of them seems underdeveloped. The characters development which was what I preferred in the first two movies, doesn't feel relatable anymore outside few moments (most of the time during the scenes with Aunt Jay, the voice of reason). The big point of the movie was adapting the Venom arc, and the movie fails in every way. Venom feels very secondary, I would even say that if you remove everything about him the movie would be as ""coherent"" that it is. I know it's ""iconic"" now in a too bad is good kind of way, but for me the Peter Parker/Venom scenes was a secondhand embarrassment. I felt bad for the characters and I even felt bad for Tobey Maguire having to play these scenes. It's simply cringe. The special effects sometimes feel too ambitious for the time, they go overboard with the action scenes giving you tense moment but very noticeable green screens or CGI. It was a time where we qualify action movies as CGI messes and Spider-man 3 is the perfect example. The end is a little too cheesy and too easy.",Spider-Man 3,Spider-Man 3 - Movie Reviews

2333,Liam B,"Nov 15, 2021","I don't think there is a person out there that believes this is the best film in the trilogy. While it turns Spider-Man in a direction that I don't particularly like, I still find that this film shows some of the charm of the first two. I can tell this film was made with care and love, but I can also tell that the studio got their hands on it and turned, what I'm sure was a great plan from Sam Raimi, into a mess of too many villains and plots. I would have love to have seen a movie with Just Harry as the Green Goblin or Just the Sandman. I don't like the inclusion of Venom in the slightest, to me, Toby's Spider-Man is supposed to be a great lighthearted guy, the ultimate nice/good guy, and I loved that. But, the symbiote turns Toby into a dark individual that I don't think fits the series. For example, The Spider-Man from the 90's animated series was a great Spider-Man to use the symbiote with. While he was a great guy, and one of my favorite Spider-Men ever, he wasn't the ultimate nice guy that Toby's Spider-Man was on the big screen. They used the symbiote much earlier in his arc, season 1 of a 5 season show, at a time when he was still arrogant and immature, as opposed to a Spider-Man who had already progressed through 2 films. The version of Spider-Man in the animated series was much more self-centered and was a much better match for the symbiote. Overall, I like this movie, but I don't like Peter for some of it, and a can't help to think what could have been.",Spider-Man 3,Spider-Man 3 - Movie Reviews

2341,Jonathan K,"Oct 09, 2021","Honestly this movie isn't nearly as terrible as a lot of people claim - it's just a movie where the desires of the talented filmmakers were overridden by those of an executive. Primarily, Sam Raimi, the brilliant filmmaker who made the first two (in addition to the wonderful Evil Dead trilogy) did not want to make a Venom movie, as he considered Venom a boring villain, but the studio forced his hand to do it anyway. And as such, this is a movie made by instruction, made be a director that made the preceding entries out of passion. Combine this with some numerous production complications and self-proclaimed genius Danny Elfman refusing to write the music because he felt Raimi didn't appreciate his unbridled genius, and you've got a movie with massive, massive problems just due to happenstance. And it's actually rather sad, as much about the movie actually works very well -- The climax is hugely entertaining and ends with a moment of resolve, rather than defeat, the way Peter finally stands against Harry are actually quite cathartic, and the new Composer's musical score is much better than the forgettable-at-best fluff that we got from the previous two movies (as let's be real - the wonderful main theme was the only piece of music from the first two movies worth listening to). There's some efficient (yet widely misunderstood) comedy bits in this movie, and it is interesting to see not only Parker himself becoming increasingly violent, but one of the main villains increasingly, of his own accord, becomes a more and more volatile person, making him a good villain. If you loved the first two I'd ultimately recommend this one - the only real reason I hesitate is that there are some depressing ""my dreams never came true"" beats that come up during the story, but so long as you acknowledge that it's not nearly as good.",Spider-Man 3,Spider-Man 3 - Movie Reviews

Despite the cast (the only good actors are Rosemary Harris, JK Simmons and James Franco), the villains are good. There is more action in this movie than in the other two combined, and I loved it because Peter Parker's arc was something I always felt bored watching. And this film is more than an emo Peter Parker. This emo Peter makes sense, I finally managed to have empathy for the protagonist, and the conclusion is perfect and touching. I ended the film proud of Peter. Finally, if I said the first film isn't that good, and the second one is good but overrated, this third one is underrated and deserves more than a ""cult"" status.",Spider-Man 3,Spider-Man 3 - Movie Reviews

2351,Sean L,"Sep 21, 2021","At the onset of his third big-picture treatment, we find young Peter Parker in an unfamiliar predicament: he's genuinely happy! Almost annoyingly so, in fact. Even his longtime love interest, Mary Jane Watson, seems to think he's laying it on too thick and tries to tell him as much in a series of awkward, abbreviated conversations between crime-fighting bouts. Parker pays no mind, of course, produces a string of awful motivational speeches when she needs emotional support and swiftly swings himself straight back onto the singles scene. Well, that didn't take long. Now Spidey is sad again! Just in time to tangle with three(!) competing super-villains, a rival in the workplace and a major league identity crisis. Not unlike its predecessors, Spider-Man 3 has way too much going on, a problem that's ballooned with each subsequent installment. The first two films manage to succeed in spite of this weakness, persevering with a great shared cast, strong character moments and well-earned payoffs. In those films, Pete's best pal Harry Osborn slowly works his way through a patient, simmering villainous turn. Here, he's abruptly hot-shotted in the opening action scene, carelessly reset and cast aside until the finale. Venom is birthed and dispensed in less than an act. Sandman's arc has enough emotional heft to single-handedly carry the counter narrative, but he always feels like a third wheel. Gwen Stacey pops in and out of the frame at random. There's just no room for these subplots to breathe amidst all the frantic competition, the race to grab every last thread and hurriedly weave them into something loosely resembling a story. Maybe with a touch of nuance and panache, a skilled director could have worked a little magic and turned this troubled script into an acceptable early-period superhero flick. Sam Raimi is anything but a nuanced director. At best, he's capable but limited, habitually caught in the act of winking at his own shortcomings in uniquely entertaining ways. No wonder he's best regarded for his gleefully deranged horror movies, where over-stressed people behave irrationally (and a little comically) in high-pressure situations. Under ideal circumstances, he can incorporate his eccentricities into the fabric of a film without negatively affecting its story, but not with so many other jobs on his plate. I'm not sure if the hammy over-acting is his fault or the stars', but I tend to lean toward the former because it's so hopelessly widespread. Nothing feels natural in this film, from the janky dialogue and clumsy delivery to the rushed primary character arc and dated special effects. I can still remember how this felt in the theater, bad enough that I avoided revisiting it for nearly fifteen years, and it hasn't improved with time. I can see bits and pieces of promise dotted here and there, hints that the overachieving Spider-Man 2 wasn't just a fluke, but they're drowned by the hurry to expand an already-crowded universe and get everything back to an unconvincing status quo in time for the closing credits.

2364,Cailan D,"Aug 06, 2021","In many ways, Spider-Man 3 is structurally the same as its two predecessors: Peter starts out the movie as Spider-Man and the villains, who aren't inherently villains, become so as the movie progresses. The biggest difference this time is that there are two villains rather than one and Peter plays a big part in why the villains are fighting him. In many ways, this same structure works to the film's benefit and gives us some interesting characters and nice action sequences. It's another example of if a system isn't broken, don't fix it. SM 3 also adds a lot of depth to Peter's relationships with those around him, which becomes especially important as Peter changes throughout the film in pretty drastic ways that have big consequences for him. SM 3 is a movie that exemplifies that concept that you can be your own worst enemy. The acting is pretty good overall, although there is a casting choice that to this day I'm not a big fan of. The effects in the movie have slightly raised the bar from the previous films, making this a slight improvement from SM and SM 2. All that said, SM 3 is a bit of a letdown and isn't as good as the other two. Many scenes lack the directorial and written finesse than they had in the first two which causes some scenes to feel really awkward and a bit disruptive to the flow of the film. The dialogue is a bit cheesy at times and there are some scenes that don't make a lot of sense. Sandman and Venom are decent villains but they aren't quite as good as Green Goblin and Doc Ock were, which is partially because they come from different plotlines so there isn't as much time to develop their characters as there would optimally be. One of the biggest issues of SM 3 is exactly that: there are a bunch of storylines going on at once so the movie doesn't have a clear and direct focus for a lot of its runtime, so certain things don't get the development they deserve. The film balances all these stories as well as it can and overall does a decent job, but there are things that could've been explored a bit more. The ending has an emotional punch to it to nicely caps off the trilogy and should leave viewers satisfied enough as the credits roll. SM 3 is undoubtedly a letdown from its two predecessors but is a decent enough movie to be watchable and enjoyable at times.",Spider-Man 3,Spider-Man 3 - Movie Reviews

I recommend Casino Royale, Skyfall and No Time To Die when it comes to a typical binge on the Daniel Craig Bond movies and recommend Quantum Of Solace and SPECTRE just once.

2414,Patrick D,"Nov 20, 2021",So overall I like the movie but it could have been so much better. I just think they try to tie things in way too much with this.

2415,Luke J,"Nov 17, 2021","Spectre is an entertaining and overlong spy thriller. Although it fails to reach the heights of Casino Royal or Skyfall- Spectre is a watchable, and often quite fun Bond movie. The action is great, cinematography is beautiful, performances are generally good, but the writing is fairly sloppy. Trying to have Blofeld become the one behind all of Bond's previous troubles is clearly retconning- and doesn't work great. Having Blofeld be Bond's jealous step-brother is just plain stupid- how would Bond not recognize someone he grew up with? The pacing is also a big problem. The opening is great with an amazing tracking shot followed by great action. In the middle act things slow down considerably, and the story isn't engaging enough to warrant it. Then the final act tries to squeeze in too much, and despite some great action it is jarring the way things jump from one event to the next so abruptly. It waits until the last 40 minutes to finally reveal the villain and have him interact with Bond- then we get an extended monologue, torture scene, and escape scene within a less than 20 minutes or less. The way Bond goes from having his brain scrambled to moments later being a deadeye shot, blowing up the entire base and escaping- is just silly and shows how carelessly some of the sequences were put together. There are a handful of other times where the logic just doesn't add up. Walken delivers a very hammy performance as Blofeld, a totally cartoonish villain when compared against previous Craig- Bond villains. All that said- this is a Bond movie with lots of style, great action, exotic locals, beautiful women, wonderful camera work, and a solid central performance by Craig (who is easily my favorite Bond).",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

2418,Toby H,"Nov 14, 2021","Spectre is another entertaining and engaging Craig outing, even if a slight step back from Skyfall. Watch it for Waltz, he's as masterful as ever. We're glad Craig opted to avoid any ghosts and do one more.",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews
2419,Stefan Z,"Nov 13, 2021","Ah yes, the one that thinks it's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, but is actually Austin Powers in Goldmember. This is definitely a goofy Bond movie masquerading as serious one. I actually watched this twice in the theatres when it came out. That's how much I loved it at the time. I now know I was forcing myself to accept the glaring awful writing. I never particularly liked the writing even back then, but justified liking it for other aspects like directing, cinematography, musical score, action set pieces, and having the best costume design in the series. That last one I still believe. Just like how the jarring editing in tandem with poor blocking weighs the overall quality of Quantum of Solace down, so too does the writing of Spectre. Skyfall had some ridiculous plot holes as well but there were other aspects of the writing keeping it from being a totally trash script unlike this one. Thomas Newman's score is even better than I remember. I think I might even prefer it to his Skyfall score. However, the cinematography is way worse. For some reason I thought the super saturated sepia filter was present only in the cold open in Mexico, which would be bad enough, but it's like that throughout the film. Not a fan ever usually of sepia and here its at a whole other tier. I do really like Bautista's character. One of my favourite henchman honestly. The Austin Martin DB10 is one of my favourite Bond cars ever. It's number one of the modern cars (modern equals Brosnan and Craig eras). The car chase in Rome is decent, not as bad as some die hard fans say it is. I liked it. I would have preferred Rome be in winter to somewhat try to justify the lack of traffic. There definitely were some vehicles in the way, but perhaps not enough. Back to the writing. The C stuff that M is dealing with makes no sense. Dont they already have information on everyone? What exactly is going to change with having more of it? The Blofeld stuff makes absolutely no sense. Brothers? Seriously? not only is that bad by itself, it makes the world of of the entire series so much smaller. Bond also has to deal with him on his own by the end. Where is the rest of all his minions? and why in the old MI6 building? How did Bond shoot down a plane with a pistol (ok that one I always had a problem with, but now with everything else, it just feels even worse. When were they (Bond and Madeline) falling in love exactly? Because it wasn't in this movie. Speaking of which, never in this series have I seen more nonsensical reasons for having sex since The Man with the Golden Gun. Neither times did it feel appropriate. One of them was done for laughs and I wasn't laughing. some jokes actually do work though, the writing isn't absolute garbage. I like Q and a lot of his lines, most of the time. I like the Sam Smith theme song less and less every time I hear it. When it first came out, I loved it, was in my top 5 of all Bond themes. By now it's somewhere close to the bottom 5 for me if not already there. The graphic of the theme song is probably even worse honestly. Some weird shadows over people's faces going on. The cold open isn't even as great as I remember. No only is the sepia filter so overbearingly distracting, the first cut from the long take happens at a pretty random and awkward moment.",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

2422,Jean L,"Oct 30, 2021",Spectre continues the story of Daniel Craig as James Bond and unfortunately is not one of the strongest instalments of this franchise. In here James Bond is tested by one of its toughest opponents yet Ernst Blofeld played by Christoph Waltz who is set to take over all the intelligence agencies of the world and make the world bow to him through an organization called Spectre. Craig here continues to kick ass and in here is struggling with the passing of M as played by Judy Dench. Now the mantle is taken over by the great Ralph Fiennes who is not as caring as Dench's M but is more stern and direct and gets in more sparring moments with Bond. The meat of the story though is the '' Bond Female'' played by the great French actress Lea Seydoux of Blue is the Warmest color fame. This is the best female character for this franchise since Casino Royale and establishes a romance that has great consequences for the story. Unfortunately even with Sam Mendes back as director this movie pales in comparison to Skyfall. Is convoluted with a very long dull pace and despite the great performance by Waltz this villain is quite disappointing with a very disappointing climax. This film could have been so much better,Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

Blofeld, played by Christoph Waltz, is kinda wasted in the movie, which is disappointing because Waltz is such a masterful actor and he could have had a much larger presence in the movie.

2429,Nathan D,"Oct 10, 2021","Spectre is satisfactory with a lot of elements that hold up throughout the whole film. Yet, several components get lost in the story that is not to the capacity it should be at. The story is flawed and does not flow right. This problem is apparent in the character arc of the villain. Just like Quantum of Solace, Spectre handles its villain terribly. Ernst Stavro Blofeld's story is so muddled with very little explanation. There is a lot of verbal exposition, but never any visual storytelling. Blofeld's storyline is a victim of this problem as the film had a near 150-minute screen duration yet can not show any relevant information. However, the film can get one of the Bond girls right and not just have Léa Seydoux be the sexual one-off that Monica Bellucci is. Speaking of Bellucci, she is part of a weak opening. Bellucci should have never been in the movie since her character is a misfire. Spectre is the fourth film in this version of the franchise, and the filmmakers should know that they need to treat their characters better. The film also has a mixed bag in the technical aspects of the film. The cinematography is bland, with hardly any shots that are visually appealing. The film uses the hand-held camera too much and focuses on the wrong details. One of those two problems is more at the fault of Sam Mendes as his directing is a step-down from Skyfall. Mendes does not fulfill the concept and story of this movie in an orderly fashion. There are various moments in the film where it feels like a parody of a Bond movie that you would see on a sketch show. The cast is at fault here with some weak performances from multiple actors. Daniel Craig is at his lowest point in Spectre with a very emotionless performance. Craig delivered this fun cockiness in the other films, but here he exhibits a bland personality. Christoph Waltz is solid, yet it is hard to see the range of his character when Waltz has very little screen time. Léa Seydoux is also a decent actor in the ensemble, and it was nice to see that she had a strong sense of emotion in times of uncertainty. Dave Bautista is a prominent addition to the cast and adds some much-needed variety to the film. Ben Whishaw is a delight in the role Q, yet he was missing that spark that he had in Skyfall. Lastly, there is Ralph Fiennes. Fiennes is excellent as M, and it was nice to see M expanded on with Fiennes making him a more likable character. Spectre is a misfire in the James Bond franchise, yet does have a few redeeming qualities in some of its departments. The story has a few bumps, and Sam Mendes is not doing the best work he can. However, Spectre is watchable as that is one highlighting aspect with any of these James Bond movies. Read more reviews like this at postcreditreviews.com",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

2435,David M,"Oct 08, 2021","Like Quantum Of Solace, this is a film that is destined to suffer by virtue of being a sequel to its predecessor; in this film's sake, to possibly the best Bond film of them all. Once again like Quantum of Solace, this film benefits from revisiting long after initial release; though the action sequences and the over-arching plot are closer to the entertainingly over-the-top traditions of much earlier in the series, this is never over-egged. The balance is in fact just about right, and there are moments of direction and design that provide a visual impact that's quite unlike much I can remember in any other film in the series. It is too long - when Bond says 'this isn't over yet just' before we cut to the film's denouement from what we all expected to be the denouement when we saw it first time around, it's tempting to find yourself saying 'Really?'. The 4 (or will it be 5?) film arc of the plot requires this extra ending and whilst it does mean the film outstays its welcome a little, it's an undeniably well-executed final finale. That there are at least 2 Daniel Craig Bond films better than this (I'm writing this before seeing No Time To Die) could sound like a criticism, but on its own terms and with the benefit of time, this is a comfortable success.",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

It's not a great film, but I'd argue better than this one. Worse yet, this film is overlong and slow as sin. There's a couple of good action sequences, the cast is good, and treating it's female lead as more than it's male leads disposable condom are all great. The cinematography is decent too, but all this is wasted with the stupid twist done decades earlier and better in the film mentioned earlier, as well as a tendency to become formulaic, which HORRIFIES me. I HATE what this movie does to this movie's villain. It's too nostalgia-baity and pandering. I give this a 4/10. I'm scared No Time To Die might be just as unoriginally stupid from what I've heard.

2443,Lequisha S,"Oct 05, 2021","They legitimately borrowed an Austin Powers Goldmember plot point with their hackneyed attempt at creating emotional resonance between Bond and Christoph Waltz' blofeld. This movie recycled so much from previous films in the Craig era. It tried to give 007 a Bond girl that he truly cared for, but there was none of the chemistry and flair Casino Royale had in the Bond-Vesper relationship. It tried to do the secret organization pulling the strings bit that Quantum of Solace did with Mr. White and the Quantum organization. It tried to do the villain-has-personal-attachment-to-Bond thing that Skyfall did. And on all three fronts, it failed miserably. Worst of all, there were so many dull points in the movie. If you won't have the depth or subversiveness of the better Bond entries, at least have interesting action.",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

I thought the action, as in pretty much all Bond films, was the standout for me. The train sequence was brilliantly choreographed and the climatic scene added some spectacular set piece action that will be etched into the Bond archives. Performance wise all good as expected once more, however Christoph Waltz as the films leading antagonist provided his usual demonic demeanour and his appreance weaves nicely into the narrative that had been building through the films prior to Spectre. This certainly does no harm to a group of films that has built itself up, especially since Craig has been at the helm, as one of the best action franchises of all time.",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

2447,MSBReviews .,"Sep 29, 2021","Rating: B ""Spectre fails to reach the tremendous potential of its intriguing narrative and fascinating antagonist, but Sam Mendes still pulls off a decent James Bond flick. The screenplay raises significant issues with an incredibly dull subplot that deeply affects the pacing of a bloated runtime. In addition to this, Christoph Waltz's lack of impactful screentime is disappointing, to say the least, despite a brilliant performance from the actor. Fortunately, the jaw-dropping action set pieces elevate the overall film, which also benefits from gorgeous cinematography (Hoyte van Hoytema) and exceptional acting across the board. Daniel Craig and Léa Seydoux's characters relationship is emotionally compelling, making Bond's mission feel more like an interesting personal journey. One of the best movies of the franchise is buried somewhere under the messy screenplay, but what can be found at the surface has much to appreciate.""",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

The pacing was atrocious, especially because I feel like they could have ended it at the two hour mark, with slight modifications, if any, and called it there. Hey, they brought back other Bond tropes I didn't like, such as storylines just being dropped and never brought back up again. The characters are also a bit flat this time around, the soundtrack's kind of generic, and Daniel Craig is as mumbly as ever, but he does deliver on the actions scenes, so he's done a solid job overall making this his Bond. The visual effects were well done, with neither distracting CGI of most modern blockbusters, nor the awkward mistakes of the 60s/70s/80s. The comic relief is good, and at the end of the day, this is still more interesting than some of the worst ones of the 70s and 80s. I'm really hoping the quality of Skyfall returns, like Bond has 24 times now. I will say, however, the surveillance stuff was timely commentary for 2015 the way Tomorrow Never Dies' was in 1997, and to this day for both, so they were at least trying.",SHOW MORE,Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

Tom Holland does very well in his portrayal of both Spiderman and Peter Parker, and the villain, played by Michael Keaton, is one of the more memorable villains in the MCU. However, the main issue I have with this film is that Spiderman never feels like his own hero, just like Tony Stark's shadow, up until the end of course. Even the villain, however, doesn't even have any conflict with Peter, he just feels like a villain that would fight against the Avengers, or more specifically, Tony Stark. I feel like the film relied too much on Tony Stark and never came out of his shadow. The film in general, however, was still fun to watch and it's one that I've seen several times, it's just that there are a few issues that I have with it.",Spider-Man: Homecoming,Spider-Man: Homecoming - Movie Reviews

2464,Rafael R,"Oct 28, 2021","My favourite Spider-Man movie. Tom Holland's version of the hero is the most human between the main trio (him, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield). He's a real teenager: anxious, acts by impulse, he's the Spider-Man who most want to be a hero. Most people complain that Tony Stark replaced Uncle Ben in MCU. I completely disagree. When Peter met Tony he already was Spider-Man by around six months. Uncle Ben has already died and Stark was someone who gave Peter a purpose. His turnaround sentence is the best I saw in a Spider-Man movie. But a Spider-Man movie isn't only made of Spider-Man. We have Peter Parker's arc outside the suit as well. And it's excellent. The high school environment looks like a high school environment (the best friend, the bully, the crush, the cynical, everyone is here and they're great characters) and Tom Holland is the most charismatic and trustworthy Peter Parker (as a teenager, he looks and acts like one) and his chemistry with Laura Harrier (Liz) is undeniably cute. Finally, Vulture is an excellent villain: he's imposing, has a motivation that makes sense, and despite not having Spider-Man as a direct enemy, is a person who is next to Peter and had the superhero interfering in his plans. My only issue with this movie is Aunt May, who is constantly treated like a MILF, and that joke is the only one that is repetitive and never works. It's sad because Marisa Tomei is a good actress and has the perfect age-looking for the role.",Spider-Man: Homecoming,Spider-Man: Homecoming - Movie Reviews

2472,Marco B,"Sep 16, 2021","Spider-Man finally gets a full length MCU treatment in this (sort-of) reboot to the franchise. Tom Holland is probably the most accurate portrayal of our young hero, Peter Parker, as he deals with the after math of working with Iron Man's Avengers (see Civil War). Peter is an easy-going fun loving kid who wants the girl, to impress Tony Stark, and to be popular. The positive in this film is that it is a real coming of age tale with a kid trying to deal with being a kid. Even our villain, The Vulture, is excellently played by (my favourite Batman) Michael Keaton, who has less of a plan and is just plain greedy. This film suffered from a lack of consequences as Peter has nothing really to lose, only his potential position in the Avengers, which isn't that big a deal. The other problem with this film is it can't decide whether it's a teen flick, action movie, coming of age tale or an origin story. Because of this, the plot and pacing can be off at times, but the acting makes up for this as Spidey really shines through.",Spider-Man: Homecoming,Spider-Man: Homecoming - Movie Reviews

Of course that's not putting down the brilliant Spider-Man 2 from Sam Rami, however this movie is the one I gravitate towards when wanting to put on a Spider-Man film. The Amazing cast really helps push the movie to a higher level with 'Tom Holland' playing Peter Parker/Spider-Man this is the first time I actually believed the actor could actually be in high school whereas former iterations who looked in there mid 20s. Tom Holland to me plays both Spider-Man & Peter brilliantly with Michael Keaton also doing a superb job as the movies villain 'The Vulture' Michael manages to make you feel bad and understand the character one moment then makes you fear him the next, You have to give props to the actor when his powerless character is threatening a superhuman and you are actually worried for the latter.

2475,Stephy S,"Sep 04, 2021","An action-packed coming of age story full of laughs and engaging fight sequences, Spider-Man Homecoming is a cheesy story that doesn't take itself too seriously but still makes time for heartfelt scenes that show who Peter Parker is as a person. The CGI from Marvel is phenomenal, as to be expected. The plot is your average light hearted Marvel plot and it works about as well as you'd expect, the writing isn't some magnum opus but it's decent enough for it to be forgiven. The cast is however a bit hit or miss, Robert Downey Jr is charismatic and a blast as always and Michael Keaton is insidious and one of the better Marvel villains, but we can't speak about the cast without talking about its rendition of Spider-man aka Peter Parker. Tom Holland is truly fantastic, he's cheesy, he's quippy, he's charming, he's everything you could ever want out of a Spider-Man, and most importantly, he's having fun in the role. Unfortunately, outside of these three, the rest of the cast is pretty forgettable. The pacing while at times too fast is never terrible.

It became more complicated with more mystery and unpredictable twists. The threat was more alarming and prominent to the whole school. There was also a bigger danger to Harry and his trio, which made me more invested in them. Even though I was more interested in the story, the run time was a big issue.

2529,Puroo R,"May 08, 2021","After watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone I had gotten really high hopes for the Harry Potter franchise. I was expecting all of them to be as simplistic and visually appealing as that movie. With that in mind I watched the second movie today and sadly, it doesn't live up to the mark on almost any of the parameters. That's not to say that it's a bad movie. It's not. But it's not a good Harry Potter movie. To begin with, the movie's CGI hasn't aged pretty well. And that's actually really surprising because the first one was so good so this one should have had a higher budget and thus more advanced VFX. But other than the Basilisk, most of the CGI hasn't aged so well. Especially that of Dobby. When he was banging his head in the drawer in the beginning of the movie, the shelves of the drawer were shaking in the opposite direction of where they should shake. And when Harry puts Dobby in the wardrobe it looked more like the wind is opening the door instead of Dobby. There are plenty of examples of bad CGI in the movie but I don't want to take it too far. Speaking of Dobby, he's had a very bad introduction. The way he is behaving is annoying. If I were to behave like that my mom would have slapped me all across the face. Sure he does get a wholesome ending, but that's yet to see how he turns out. Draco also became more annoying now, with constantly trying to bully Harry even though he can't do a thing. Myrtle spoke like a nerd Harley Quinn. I get this movie is trying to be campy, but that goes way too far. The story is a good part here. Although it's not as easy as Sorcerer's Stone, it is still very nicely detailed. Too many incidents happen in it, but yet it does not feel bloated. It feels absolutely to the point, with none of that ""side quest"" things movies often use to pad the runtime. Everything happens for a reason and it all pays off in the end. The scenes with Ron, particularly in the beginning, are always funny and memorable. Though Hermione doesn't play as huge part in this movie as Harry and Ron do, she also gets a decent screen time, although without any character arc. I'm still on the second movie of this franchise, so I can't exactly say if this is among the good movies or the bad ones. But I really hope the rest of the movies are more leaning towards the first one in terms of tone. I remember every scene right now, but I can see myself forgetting most of the parts in the next few months.",Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - Movie Reviews

2577,Jacob J D,"Jun 28, 2021","""The Secret Life of Pets 2"" was made to teach new parents a lesson Sometimes I feel like Max, the Jack Russell Terrier. As much as I want to be like Rooster, the cool and collective sheepdog, sometimes my nervous and over-protective energy can get the best of me as most new parents have realize in the beginning years. As if Illumination was thinking of me when producing the script, they decided to name the baby Max is zealously protecting over as Liam my own toddler's name. I was only expecting childish fun gags and witty observations about the animals that rule our lives. Never thought the film's moral compass was to make me feel less alone with Max complaining ""why is the world so dangerous"" as I try to prevent my little ones from hitting themselves into pesky edges in our household. True, this theme is a minor element in this entertaining, energetic, and humorous sequel that should satisfy fans of the original. However, being present in the most important subplot reminded me that the most important lessons can come from unexpected places. As Rooster (perfect voice casting portraying the gruff, aloof, grit, and authenticity of Harrison Ford) said to Max after he reflected paranoia of Liam possibly falling, ""so what if he falls? He will just get back up."" It's a perfect metaphor that we can't protect our kids at all times forever, to let them go to grow experimenting as Max put it in the end this ""complex, scary and beautiful world."" Following the model example of Rooster, Max learns to face his own fears giving an example of bravery and courage as a result to Liam. Of course, most people are not going in seeking out these themes in this animated feature rather a visual vibrant, well-pace, and fun time that doesn't outstay its welcome. This film hit that mark overall even feeling more so like an episodic Saturday cartoon. I say that because the structure is unusual considering there is three subplots that feels like three separate episodes that in the end interconnect for a finale. This lack of lasered focus linear structured plot results in a thin story that questions if a sequel only exits simply because its predecessor was a box office success. Nevertheless, at least the themes and lessons learned mentioned earlier intertwines with the three main characters in the final act. At times it seems a bit mature for the younger audience with multiple suspenseful tense scenes however even my toddler son took it well as if he were inspired to become Rooster himself. The voice cast is pitch perfect and strong all around that brings relevance and charm to these characters that will support a healthy fan base looking forward to the next entry. Thank you for the lesson Harrison Ford.",The Secret Life of Pets,The Secret Life of Pets 2 - Movie Reviews

Anyone who knows psychology or who has suffered recovering from mental illness knows that kind all-to-common action gets people killed. I can't help but remember a friend who introduced me to that movie who during that exact scene and said, ""I like that dog."" ... as he refused to awknowledge or respect a mental illness his daughter was struggling with; and was just exacerbating her condition. It could have been a decent feel-good movie if it hadn't had that scene. But that scene turned it from a potential tool for healing and recovery to slipping glass shards in the medicine bottle.

2611,Late R,"May 24, 2020","‘The Secret Life of Pets' was a pretty average animated film whose ""what do our pets get up to when we're not around"" premise made it relatable, funny and charming to pet owners/lovers. The sequel has practically nothing to do with its title anymore (you can only pull that trick once, after all) and loses anything that made it somewhat original. Now we're into very familiar animated-animal territory that we've all seen many times before. Sure, there are some good messages (albeit very standard stuff) and a few things that'll probably make you smile, but for the most part, as with its predecessor, it's not particularly memorable and, in fact, the most stand-out thing is the colourful animation (the backgrounds are lovely) and character design. In short, kids might enjoy it and there are a few moments that might catch your attention, but for most adults, there's not much here.",The Secret Life of Pets,The Secret Life of Pets 2 - Movie Reviews

2648,V T,"Oct 01, 2021","I've watched the movie for a total of 4 times and let me tell you something (two times on HBO and 2 second more on a pirate site): The movie is utterly garbage and unbearable to watch, even with the Utimate Cut. Till now, i still don't know why people are praising a poorly-written movie with extremely low pacing and dogshit performances, maybe because everyone can have diferrent opinions about a subjective subject i guess. Nonetheless, the movie is still something worth to be buried somewhere else outside of this world, far from our reach. There are many problems with the movie, but the biggest problem of all was the plot. It was just unbelievably stupid and corny, left the Martha scene alone. Don't get me wrong, i don't have any personal hate on Snyder but this movie is just something else beyond the conception of intelligence. I refuse to think that this was made by a decent human being. It's like watching a Neil Breen movie for Christ sake, everything is completely a trainwrecking mess. None of the details in it made sense in a way that a nornal mind can conprehend; how can a hateful, violent, gruesome vilgilante somehow found a immigrant alien to be hostile and then spare him the moment he knew that they had the same mother's name? Oh yeah, i know why, because the movie didn't bother to consider the logical thinking of the plot or the self-development of the characters that involved in it so they just did what they thought that be the (least) logical thing to ease the discord between the two. To summarise all of it in one sentence: it's a plain stupid movie.",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice - Movie Reviews

Surely there has to be more to it than that for such big names as Affleck, Fishburne, Adams. Et Al. The directing is amongst the most hopelessly muddled that I've ever seen in my 65+ years of cinema involvement. (My father was a cinema manager, so that had a bearing on me seeing far, far more movies all through my youth than my contemporaries who had to buy their seats.). But this thing would have had me desirous of a rebate, especially bearing in mind the price of cinema tickets these days, (my days of freebie tickets ended - unfortunately - about thirty years back) The screenplay and dialogue is poor, poor stuff indeed. And - Superman as, effective,y, - a villain? What? I'm reduced to using terms not unrelated to those of abuse in another circumstance. It is crap, it is junk, it is unwatchable dross. Don't buy the DVD, but by all means if you're curious to see how bad a flick Hollywood is capable of turning out despite a vast budget, check it on Amazon Video.

The action scenes sometimes work (the underwater opener and the man v tank showdown) but some are just over the top craziness.

2657,Taekwondo Life M,"Mar 18, 2021","Everything about this sequel to Wolf Warrior exceeds the first. The acting, the special effects, the story- all an improvement over the original installment. Wu Jing returns in this sequel. He also wrote, produced, and directed the film. The film surrounds Wu Jing's attempt to live a peaceful life in Africa when he his peace is disrupted by a mercenary army and a deadly disease outbreak. One of my criticisms of the first film was that I did not feel Wu Jing commanded the screen as the lead. Nothing could be further from the truth in this one. Rather than playing a Jackie Chan-esq character, Wu King finds his own as a compelling, interesting, and exciting action star in this one. He is very good. As for the supporting cast- Frank Grillo is always fun to watch. He appears to be the hardest working action star/character in the world. His fight with Jing in the finale of the film is well choreographed. Celina Jade is commanding as the love interest. Nwachukwu Kennedy Chukwuebuka steals every scene he is in as Jing's ""Godson"". This movie was one of the highest grossing pictures of all time. Sam Hargrave, martial artist, stuntman, and Director of the highly successful ""Extraction, stunt choreographed the underwater fight as well as many of the action scenes. This explains a lot about its success. This one is worth watching. The ending foreshadows a ""Part 3"" and I hope it is at least as good as the sequel.",Wolf Warrior 2,Wolf Warrior II - Movie Reviews
2658,Jonathan K,"Jan 19, 2021","In terms of production and narrative machinations, this is a far more complicated movie than its predecessor, so props to Wu Jing on his Directing of this film to have it work; it's not some of the best Directing you'll see by any stretch (the acting is mediocre and some of the cinematography is really rather bland), but it flows and it functions without any actual structural problems, which most certainly isn't nothing. People came to watch Action, and this movie Stars and is Directed by one of the most underappreciated Action stars working today. As such, the action is almost always from Good to Excellent, and the story-beats, while somewhat thread-bare, are enough to keep the momentum up. I was also shocked as to how much had actually happened by the end of the movie, as the amount crammed into the movie feels like it was a full hour longer (not a complaint, just an observation), as it ends with a prolonged fight scene that ends up with him battling a tank. The movie does often times come off as a bit pretentious at times, as it features heroes protecting unarmed citizens from trigger-happy killers, but it really just boils down to being an excuse to have some really cool action sequences; the movie does make you empathize for the refugees, but their part in the movie is really just a trick to generate a sense of empathy from the viewer. There is also a very, very strong Chinese Military Patriotism element in this movie, making it also feel like a Chinese Michael Bay film, but I don't count this against the movie because it makes sense (being a film made in China) and because it's actually purely a positive message - It uses heroism to bestow Patriotic Propaganda but doesn't use it to justify any morally grey misdeeds on the part of the heroes (I mean, it's literally about soldiers protecting unarmed civilians under fire). If you want a fun time you will find it in this movie, which is explosive, full of stunts, and works well on a technical level as well.",Wolf Warrior 2,Wolf Warrior II - Movie Reviews

Beaucoup plus sympathique en mercenaire au grand coeur qu'en soldat de l'armée chinoise, Wu Jing est aussi accompagné de Celina Jade et surtout de Frank Grillo, qui se délecte à jouer les salopards. Tout ceci serait une bonne nouvelle si Wolf Warrior II n'était pas un film aussi abject au niveau idéologique, considérant que l'Afrique est un continent inférieur, une zone de non-droit avec une population gentille mais ne servant que de chair à canon pour les bienfaits de l'action (on ne compte pas moins de 6 massacres filmés avec délectation).

2692,4d ago,"You can tell they put a good deal of thought into making this one maybe if for no other reason than to give the viewer connections to the original trilogy story. I have to nick the film for a few reasons. It tries so hard in the first half to try and be a drama with Anakin unsure of what he should do. The movie then segways into him completely changing course mentally almost immediately with one scene in particular seeming unbelievable by any stretch - he was conflicted before this scene but he does a complete 180 in seconds and it just seems haphazardly written here. The movie also does a disservice to our prequel heroine, Padme. She is reduced to a stand by your man 'til it kills you 50s style house wife; it's sad because she was a cool woman who could fend for herself in the first two films. She's turned into a prop here and it's only her acting that saves it from being a wash. Last ding is that it's hard to believe the Jedi didn't know the Sith Lord was right in front of them the whole time; they're supposed to be wise and have prophetic abilities. All that to say this: there are some great battle sequences including the best lightsaber battle in the series. The back and forth storytelling works well here to keep the viewer engaged. I can't say the film is easy to watch in the middle - Anakin's transition into Vader is not only convoluted but disturbing. It's especially hard to watch in juxtaposition to the rest of the series' tone. We can assume things about good and evil but to see Vader's fall from grace is very depressing. It is easily the least enjoyable 40ish minutes to watch in the whole saga. The first 40 and last 40 minutes however are enough to make it not only good but the best in the prequels. As a standalone story it is well done but not a movie you'll want to rewatch for fun - it's essential to the overarching story and that's it.",SHOW MORE,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith - Movie Reviews
2693,Aidan B,"Nov 20, 2021","Though the film can get a bit uneven at parts, the conclusion is ultimately satisfying and heartbreaking to watch as it wraps up this mediocre trilogy with spectacular fashion. ""Revenge of the Sith"" has the best story, CGI, and action of any of the prequel films made, and the film perfectly sets the stage for ""A New Hope."" I think that George Lucas had a perfect plan with this trilogy, though ended up failing in the process to get to this film. This third installment in the prequel trilogy is absolutely gorgeous to watch, and due to its very memorable and emotional moments throughout, ""Revenge of the Sith"" remains as one of the best ""Star Wars"" movie to date, despite its several flaws.",Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith - Movie Reviews

It explains Anakin's tragedy very well and the morality of the Jedi Order too. Great movie, i would suggest to Star Wars The Clone Wars Season 7 after the movie.

Also the plot itself is very epic and central for Star Wars itself. The focus in on emotions, imo the genre Space Opera gets a positive view by this movie, because it's theatralic and emotional. Dialogues and scenes might be too much ""set in scene"" for some people because they're classical theatre-like.

2729,Yuri L,"Sep 18, 2021","A very underrated movie. This film accomplished what the prequel trilogy was aiming to do, which was to elaborate on the backstory of Darth Vader and Palpatine's rise to power through the corruption of the republic. We are shown how Palpatine's manipulation of Anakin comes to fruition after years of careful planning. We see the failure of the Anakin Obi Wan relationship and the establishment of Luke and Leia's upbringings. This film also has an amazing score, including some of John William's finest works such as Battle of the Heros and Duel of the Fates. This film also makes excellent parallels with the rise of Hitler and the fall of democracy in post WW1 Germany. I do have some issues with this film, namely some of the acting is a little over the top. I also think the handling of Padme's death was rather cheesy. I think it would have been more fitting if it was eluded that Palpatine killed her instead of heartbreak.

This was my favorite movie growing up and I still have so much nostalgia for it. Anyone born in the 90s that is a star wars fan probably agrees that this was such a fun time to watch as a child. I remember my first time watching it and how amazing it was to see obiwan become ben and Anakin become Darth Vader. This inspired me to love movies the way I do today. Looking back at the movie now I definitely will note the cheesy dialogue here and there but it is still such a solid movie. I LOVE the lightsaber battles in this movie. I thought Ewan McGregor as obiwan was a perfect cast and Ian McDermott as Darth sidious is terrifying. Everyone should agree that this is by far the best of the prequel trilogy.

2737,ANDERSON G,"Sep 06, 2021","""Various Games: In Flames"" is a competent sequel but much less charismatic than its predecessor, shifting the focus to something more political, the transaction is good, the script is less linear but with continuity problems. The continuation of the franchise had more than 50 million in budget than its predecessor, although we don't feel this visually expressive improvement, the cache can have food a lot of the money, as we have a less authorial film that perpetuates what worked in the first one though it lacks a greater depth of the characters. ""Ravenous Games: On Fire"" hasn't aged as well as the first one, we feel a repetition of ideas, we have a climax that should have been built before, but the characters are still great and the performances at a good level such as costumes, makeup and soundtrack, in addition to photography, which improves significantly.

It is everything a sequel should be. This film has such an incredible fast pace and energy to it that makes it so enjoyable to watch. We also meet new characters in this film like Finnick and Johanna, who are also my two favorite characters in the series. My only main complaint is that I do think it feels a little bit too similar to the first film since we do have to go through all the training and interviews and prepping all over again since Katniss has to go back into the games.

These wonderful elements now are more blatant and over the top. Saying this though, this is the Marvel sequel we were all waiting for, incorporating unknown characters without brow-beating us about upcoming films in the MCU, potential spin-offs and sequels and just creating more depth in the Guardians universe.

2796,Nathan D,"Aug 06, 2021","This film is definitely a step-up from the first installment as the story is just so much better. James Gunn really poured a lot into this movie which led to such an amazing film. The overall message of the movie is so beautiful and offers so many iconic moments. The film always has something going on and a lot of the story details never get lost in other plots. Some aspects of the film are a tiny bit complicated, but it doesn't hurt the movie all that much. A large reason why this movie feels a lot more whole is that the characters are way better developed here. Peter's story excels greatly into something really beautiful. I would even say the same about Yondu as in the first film, Yondu didn't feel all that important. This film, however, made me greatly appreciate Yondu and his actions in the first film. Rocket, Gamora, and Nebula also get some more character development that I think benefited them greatly. Even new characters like Ego and Mantis were very easy to attach some type of connection to as they are both very well developed. The only character I would say is poorly written is Drax, which sucks because I really liked Drax in the first film. Drax came off as rude and annoying for a large part of the film and his jokes weren't all that funny this time around. As much as I loved the characters in this film from a story standpoint, the actors weren't all that great. Both Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana do a poor job in their roles. Their line delivery is off some of the time and I never felt the energy their performances had in the first film. Plus, both actors never convinced me that they had a love connection forming. Another actor that struggled was Dave Bautista. He was sometimes trying too hard to sell his joke or line that it came off in a cringeworthy way. However, the rest of the cast was pretty solid. Bradley Cooper did a fantastic job just like in the first film and new additions to the franchise Kurt Rusell and Pom Klementieff do an awesome job with both really nailing down the personalities of their characters. Michael Rooker is the stand-out to me in this film. Rooker had some great line delivery and really made the message of the film feel powerful and impactful. The production design of this film was flawless. Everything looked so stunning and the design of Ego's planet was just so well done. The color choices were great and how the technology on the planet moved was just so cool to watch. However, the cinematography felt a little weaker in this film. It was still very good, but I don't think cinematographer Henry Braham really made any shots look visually breathtaking like Ben Davis did in the first film. Something that did improve was the score. It was better than in the first one with Tyler Bates creating some memorable tracks and more of a balance between songs and the score. Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was definitely a step-up storywise, but somewhat of a step-down when looking at some of the cast. Even though I do like this film better than the first one, I do think the cast was a lot better in the first installment rather than the second. However, the strong, heartfelt story really hides all the casts' flaws and really sets this film over the top.

2797,Jonathan K,"Jul 29, 2021","The first Guardians of the Galaxy was a lot of insanity and a fair amount of heart -- this Sequel has a fair amount of insanity and a lot of heart. And I really mean it - much of the movie does ask that you feel ""this is funny"" or ""this is cool"", but there are numerous parts where the movie make you feel Mortified, Triumphant or even legitimately Sad. The final few minutes of the movie before the credits roll are absolutely spellbinding, and I literally tear-up every time I watch the final act of this movie. The final act is both Inspiring and then Heartbreaking shortly afterwards, and the fact that a Marvel movie has, upon multiple viewings, brought me to tears really shows how outstanding this film is. Like many, I would've liked a bit more insanity, but this is EASILY the Second Most Insane movie of the MCU (part 1 being the #1 spot), and since the trade-off was genuine emotional impact, I am more than happy with the exchange we got. If you love movies that cover a wide spectrum of emotions and does so effectively, then Guardians of the Galaxy 2 might be the best movie to do so in a very long time. You will laugh, you will cheer, your heartrate will occasionally rise and you will end it having had your soul crushed. In terms of pure entertainment and emotional impact and satisfaction, I'd argue this might be the best Space Opera since The Empire Strikes Back - yes, I really mean that.",Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 - Movie Reviews

2800,Cailan D,"Jul 23, 2021","GotG Vol. 2 isn't quite as good as its predecessor, but even though it does fall into the ""sequel is worse"" category, it still remains a solid and entertaining MCU blockbuster and comes close enough to the original to be enjoyable. The script doesn't have the finesse of the first movie causing the humor to drag and be a little over the top at points, but the actors do a fine job of getting around this causing a few of these moments to be genuinely funny. It's nice that this movie takes us deeper into the character of Peter Quill by exploring his family, a route that was set up well at the end of Guardians 1. What's even better about this is watching how Peter learning about and discovering his true family impacts his relationship with his ""new"" family: his fellow Guardians. This impact adds some emotional depth to the film, and makes Peter Quill a surprisingly complex character and takes him through a really nice arc that forces him to truly consider his relationships with those he cares about the most. Pratt supplements this with another great performance as the character, and his fellow Guardians castmates hit the spot as well. The movie makes sure to make good use of Kurt Russell as Ego by giving him plenty of screen time, a backstory, and a few emotional moments of his own. It also kicked ass to see the true power and capabilities of Yondu's flying arrow, something we got a taste of in the first movie but was amplified substantially in this movie. It's also still a relief and breath of fresh air that this film has no connection to the Avengers and the rest of the cinematic universe other than us knowing that it's a part of it. As mentioned before, what really prevents this movie from reaching the heights of GotG 1 for me is the humor, since even with the acting the script hampers this movie's ability to be as funny as GotG 1. GotG 2 is nonetheless still a fun and entertaining movie and is sure to leave viewers satisfied as the credits roll.",Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 - Movie Reviews

2820,Puroo R,"Aug 20, 2021","Pixar has made movies of all kinds - What if toys had feelings, what if insects had feelings, what if monsters had feelings, what if cars had feelings, what if fishes had feelings, what if rats had feelings. And now they have made Inside Out - what if feelings had feelings? Inside Out is probably one of the most underrated movies that Pixar has made. It was the first original Pixar movie which I didn't get to know about when it released (the first such one was a sequel, Monsters University), and I'm really surprised how this movie gets overlooked so easily. The way I see it, this movie is a social commentary about how we perceive life with our emotions. Riley here is a metaphor of us, how we feel when we move to a new place and are unable to handle the new life. In such situations we either feel scared, angry or depressed. When Riley starts crying in class, Joy tries to stop Sadness from ruining her memory with a vacuum but ends up destroying all her other memories. This is another metaphor from our lives, where we end up forgetting all our happy memories in times of desperation. Later on Joy and Sadness are in her memories, where they see Riley's childhood drawing of Bing Bong whom she considered her friend. The plot has been made with a complete sense of nostalgia. When we feel nostalgic, we feel both happiness and sadness at the same time. We are happy because we got to live those times, the time which was better than what we are living at the moment. We are sad because we know that time never stops, and so everyday we are straying further away from when it happened. We will never be able to live the day again, and it shall only stay in our memory. While Joy and Sadness are not present Fear, Anger and Disgust control her. I don't think I need to explain this. Riley has lost all her happiness and does not feel any sadness. Keep in mind she had previously cried in class, which is something very embarrassing for a ten year old child. As a result she does not want to show her sorrow in front of everyone since she fears people will laugh at her, so instead she tries to cover it with anger and disgust. This is just like how we behave when we are depressed but are also too afraid of what others might think if they learn about it. And then there is the memory dump, the place where the old memories are forgotten. This is one of the deepest messages that the movie gave us. To save Joy and Sadness and allow them to get out of the pit, Bing Bong readily sacrifices himself. This is because he had always considered himself and Riley friends, and he was ready to sacrifice his own life for this. It also shows how Riley has now lost the memory of Bing Bong due to her depression and frustration, and it is something she will never remember again. This is a metaphor of how we forget the small details from our childhood which gave us joy once we grow out of the phase. It also symbolises that although Bing Bong has been lost forever, Riley's joy and sadness will always remember him. This is similar to how we get nostalgic whenever we see our childhood writings and drawings. And finally when Joy and Sadness do make it back, then Joy chooses to let Sadness guide Riley. If she wanted she could have guided Riley and make her feel happy about reuniting with her parents. But in that case the moment would have completely lost the impact. So instead Sadness did it, which is why Riley started crying, something she had not done for a long time. This is yet another metaphor of when we are unable to hold our sorrow for too long and burst out crying. As a result her parents are finally able to understand the situation she is in and give her more love. In the end Riley starts feeling happy, since everyone has understood the value of Joy. She was the first emotion that Riley felt, and the one who guided them all in the time of desperation. All the other emotions came to her afterwards, which is why they are not as emotionally attached to Riley as Joy does. Joy knows what is the best for her, just like how we feel the best thing for our life is what makes us happy.",Inside Out,Inside Out - Movie Reviews

2825,Jacob R,"Jul 02, 2021","Just….how? How did Pixar make another flawless film after three films that I would either consider meh or bad? I just don't get it! Let's just make sure Pete Doctor directs every Pixar movie ever and we will be a-ok. I don't want to talk about all the good things with this movie, because let's face it: everyone has done that. Instead, I want to talk about all the things that this Pixar movie does better than all the others. First, I think this is the best voice cast for any Pixar movies prior or after this. The only one that kind of comes close for me is Toy Story 4, but that's for a different review. Biggest highlight is of course the great work of Amy Phoeler as Joy, it was just spot on. Next, comedy. Seeing how the main character is literally the concept of Joy, I would like to think that this movie was going to be funny. And I was right with this being, in my personal opinion, the funniest Pixar movie. Lewis Black as Anger is just a laughing riot to me. He was hilarious! Finally, how can you not talk about this movie without mentioning the ending, with two big emotional parts that really leave a huge impact. The first being the death of Bing Bong, which feels a little like it comes out of nowhere, but you're going to remember it. And, of course, when Riley comes home from running away and the parents also say that they miss the old home….OMG it's so good! The only kind of problem is that Anger is mainly the reason all the islands get destroyed, and no one addresses it at any moment. But that's minor, and no one is going to be thinking that in their first viewing, I only noticed it in my most previous viewing of the movie anyway. I really think someone should do a deeper dive into this movie, cause it really deserves it. However, I can only praise it for so long.

2834,Ethan T,"May 11, 2021","From a few of the same key players that brought Up, Inside Out is another profoundly affective animated drama guaranteed to pry emotion from anyone with a heart. The voice cast and animation all seem to be up to Pixar standard, while the emotion alone makes the film. The story combines the gut-wrenching and the fun, but does require the switching off of brains. Every story needs some logic or rules, even within a fantasy, to really work and have genuine stakes, and this just doesn't. You're introduced to the system, but you receive the feeling that elements and abilities In the moment, the film does more than enough to be positively memorable and pack a top-tier emotional punch, and this alone makes it good despite its numerous problems.",Inside Out,Inside Out - Movie Reviews

2844,Karol C,"Mar 22, 2021","Inside Out review A heartfelt animated movie, ""Inside Out"", takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions with creative imagination and a look back at some nostalgic moments we might have had in our childhood. Unlike any other, Pixar studios created an original movie of the emotions that go behind a person's mind and made them into having their own personalities. Focused on the mind of a little girl ,Riley her life is shown as typically any perfect childhood. With the presence of the emotion joy it shows her story of her two loving parents raising her and living the life with many moments that one child creates. Including the building of humor, friendship and playing your favorite sport. But as all children go through the other emotions such as sadness, fear ,disgust and anger it will include her experiences. However, her life takes a sudden turn when she has to move with her parents from their hometown Minnesota to San Francisco. Her emotions will be put to the test in adapting to a new lifestyle they're typically unused to. To start off , it shows the beginning of the first years in Riley's life. Transitioning from stages to the preteens years of her life. This is where she experiences many emotions and personal likeness and dislikeness. Riley is seen on her journey as she experiences all typical childhood memories. From learning how to walk to talking your first new words. Discovering your least favorite meal to favorite toy to take with you everywhere. The laughter you create and the sad moments you experience. The rewarding moments of receiving a good grade to being upset for losing an important game. As Riley is growing she has experienced majority exciting emotions until a certain news comes to her attention. She will be moving from her childhood home Minnesota, where she was born, raised, and grew up to miles away into the city of San Francisco. Despite the change , her emotion Joy makes Riley see all this in a positive way. Meeting new friends, decorating a new room and many more ideas. Arriving at the new location, Riley is quick to notice the drastic change in seeing her new home. Adapting to the city and less outdoor activity is one of the unfortunate changes making her find new adventures. On her first day of school, she is introduced to her classmates and told to talk a bit more from her time back home. As she recalls some of her favorite memories, the emotion sadness touches her favorite memory, changing Riley's memory to a sad moment and turning it into a sorrowful memory. Joy continues to try and make Riley enjoy the new memories. After they had another similar disagreement Joy and Sadness cause the core memories to be knocked from their containers and accidentally vacuumed along with them into Riley's emotional interior. With this problem, it leaves the other emotions Fear, Disgust and Anger to run the emotions until the others return changing RIleys behavior. Throughout the film it shows the many obstacles and challenges Joy and Sadness must go through to reach the headquarters. Following with revisiting old memories and lifelong imaginary friends. It will take a spin through some future glimpse some being Riley's future boyfriend and many more. Overall this unfortunate event turned out to be a better lesson. The emotions appreciating each other's teamwork to help Riley have the best life she could as she grows up. Enjoying the moments one creates as living life with a positive attitude.",Inside Out,Inside Out - Movie Reviews

2851,Nattapong S,"Mar 10, 2021","Normally, Almost every animation which are made by Disney and Pixar are interesting to most people because they mostly fun, happy to watch, beautiful graphic, etc. , but I think 'Inside out' is more than that. I have remembered that in the time this movie has been released, it was very famous. But I have not seen it yet until two months ago that I watched it. The first time I have seen this movie to the end. I understood to many media why they rated this animated movie very high. First It is about the graphic of the animation. As we have known. Disney and Pixar are one of the best animation studios about graphic, and they have done to this movie very well, such as an appearance of a character. There are lots of details about graphic, sharpness of the video, etc. Second, sound effect. In my opinion. Sound effect are very important to every movie in the scenes that want to show, or express more the feeling to the audiences than only the movie scene. And this movie expresses the feeling to the audiences very well such as happy, sad, scared. The last thing and it is the most interesting point is about feeling. It is what this movie expresses to us. For me, this part is the point that makes this movie different to other animation movies that Disney and Pixar have made. It is more than a movie for entertaining. It teaches us how we can control our feeling , however I will not tell you what feeling that I mean. I want you find it by yourself in the movie. Then after you watch it, you will understand what I have told to you. But there is one inferior point in this movie. It is distribution of the character. Some characters are very notable, but there are few characters have a few of air time, scenes that they act. In my opinion, 'Inside out' is still one of my best animation movie. For me, I give it 1/3 of the best Disney and Pixar movie of all time. If anyone is looking for some full of quality movie. 'Inside out' is the great choice. concluding, very well work for Disney and Pixar making this movie. I give 9 out of 10. I hope you enjoy my review more or less.

My only critique is the film was originally shot to be about two-and-a-half hours and was shortened by the studio and included reshoots. Originally Tessa Thompson's character 142 was to have more backstory, Hela's arrival was completely altered by CGI from what was seen in the trailer BUT what did work in reshoots was the addition of a funny ‘theatrical' performance including an Oscar winning actor.",Thor: Ragnarok,Thor: Ragnarok - Movie Reviews

We can't have economic freedom without bodily autonomy and basic civil liberties as well as a government that enforces those liberties. Kidnapping Fischer was a vicious, cowardly and morally bankrupt and not the work of a hero. I disliked the character so much I didn't care what happened to them so the movie was boring as well. The fact this ham fisted, pedantic and desultory film is supposed to be ""intelligent"" is particularly disturbing. Imagine a future where computer nerds rule the world by forcibly kidnapping us and then implanting ""good"" ideas into our brains and those of our children to make sure we do the ""right"" thing.

Then I watched it again and appreciated the extremely impressive elements of it much more. The directing talent from Christopher Nolan is truly remarkable and the special effects/CGI is great. The action scenes especially in the middle of the film were my favorite parts, plus the ending scene. Not to mention the cast of actors that they were able to have participate in the production, very noteworthy. The film does have some issues though that may alienate some viewers. Much of the phenomenon in the movie is left up to a lot of interpretation and can make your mind too blown while you're still trying to keep up with the plot. It can be a lot to take in all at once and confuse people who aren't used to a movie like this. Plus I think that the romance between Cobb and Mal bogged down the main mission of the team a little too much, but I still see why something like that was included. Overall a pretty good movie! There is a lot to say about this movie and many ways to analyze it and that's why it was popular I guess!",Inception,Inception - Movie Reviews

2960,Stefano D,"Aug 27, 2021","A perfectly paced, written and directed story that will send your mind to an endless pondering and mesmerising journey. Nolan really knows what he's doing when it comes fiction. He knows how to deliberately lose the audience's comprehension to then retrieve it with magnificence. What truly makes Nolan's famous fiction movie Inception a masterpiece of time and reality mayhem, is the way the story is written and developed. It starts with a pretty strenuous concept: the inception of dreams. But then, as the story unwraps, with well-pace actions, embracing dialogues and great characters dissections, we begin to fathom what this concept of infiltrating dreams can serve for, alongside how it actually works – using great insight of true physics and thorough studies upon the very subject of dreams and time. All leading to an ending that wraps into this ""open ways"" notion. The casting is straight up perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio embraced the role of Dom Cobb as a professional, really diving into the trauma of the protagonist and exploiting the pain and adventurous errands that this character went through in his past. Tom Hardy nailed the role of the Eames, a character capable of impersonating others within one's dream, using his seriousness and his passionate sheer acting. Cillian Murphy, managed to play the role of a broken son left with the legacy of his dead father like a boss, using his prowess acting and his bewitching voice. And last, but not least, Eliott Page, who really knows how to do her job and create an emotional and interesting character, Ariadne, ready to help her team as the ingenious architect of dreams. I could spend a day writing about the story and how the cast, the full cast, is perfectly chosen, but I think the points I've given are enough to catch your attention – without spoiling the whole narrative – if you haven't seen the movie yet.",Inception,Inception - Movie Reviews

2973,Jonathan K,"Oct 25, 2021","There are few objectively bad cinematic experiences that I like as much as the Michael Bay Transformers movies, but Part 2: Revenge of the Fallen, is the one I will never rush to defend. It's aggressive, it's loud, it's obnoxious, it's WAY too long, and I never thought I'd say this about a Michael Bay movie, but: It feels Lazy. This last one is the biggest oddity in regards to this movie, as Michael Bay's biggest problem has always been that it feels like he Directs and Edits after drinking a double-dosage of RedBalls Energy Drink (for those that watched Chapelle Show), but half of this movie looks like Bay just Directed it after taking Melatonin, as the cinematography is surprisingly plain, the stunts less intense than his usual work, the action blocking is a lot less intricate than with any other movie of his, and there's so much in this movie that simply did not need to exist that it felt like Bay was shooting most of this out of obligation. Let's throw in the fact that this movie is simultaneously the Most Comedic yet Least Funny entry of his Transformers movies, and you also have a movie that suffers greatly from inconsistent tone (a problem the others suffered from as well but not nearly to the degree here). The one distinctly good moment in this movie is a desperate fight in the forest between Optimus Prime and several Decipticons, as it's one that plays out with genuine stakes, has weighty consequences, ends on a powerful note and feature's excellent cinematography, choreography and sound design. It's a shame as this bit is genuinely great, the sole legitimately shining moment in a movie that balances between low-tier mediocrity and the outright awful.",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen - Movie Reviews

2976,Puroo R,"Aug 18, 2021","When I had heard everyone say that Transformers movies keep getting worse as time moves on I was actually very hesitant to watch this. I really liked the first movie so there was no way I could believe that THIS franchise could possibly be bad (although I did see that later on, I didn't see it here). In my review of the first movie I said how I got interested in the Transformers franchise after watching it, since I didn't know this was actually a toys company and not an anime series. If that movie was just the introduction, this was where the real action takes place. I saw Revenge of the Fallen on Amazon Prime soon after the first one. I only had one week left before my Prime subscription would expire, so I had only decided to dedicate this time to watching all the Transformers movies so that I could understand what this franchise is all about. Unlike the future movie this one actually expanded on what was established at the first movie. Although the human characters were not as interesting as the previous movie and the story was also pretty much empty, the action scenes completely made up for it. As usual the CGI and action was very good. The new characters introduced were fun to watch. I really like to see it when new characters are brought in and given their own character development as they transform into cool cars. However not everything about this movie was good. Like I said above the human characters were not as interesting. The entire blood about Sam going to college and his parents continuously pestering him was very annoying. This was the last time we got to see Mikaela, which is also something very sad IYKWIM. This movie was able to explain very well the entire concept of Transformers, something that the prequel fail to do so. Before I used to think that Autobots and Decepticons are supposed to be cars, but now I know that they are actually robots which can turn themselves into whatever they see in front of them. I would definitely give a rewatch afterwards sometime in the future whenever I have to show this franchise to a new generation.",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen - Movie Reviews

The movie isn't finished yet, and you can tell; there are some funny awkward jokes strewn around, and there are a few minor narrative holes here and there, but I can see where they're heading, and I LOVE it. The plot is very interesting to explore, including the history of Transformers and the lasting effects of that legacy that transcends time. Also you will not find better action in any other film than in this one; the action is nonstop and visually appealing and it will keep you at the edge of your seat.

While I do think the opening and closing moments of the movie are solid, I think this movie seriously drags in the middle. For a movie that is supposed to be the big finally, this movie is super underwhelming. As usual, the acting and dialogue aren't great, but this movie mercifully doesn't focus much on the unconvincing romance in this series. I just feel the way it ends is kind of a cop-out, happily ever after type of ending, and it makes the whole series feel a bit pointless. I can't speak on behalf of the book but I think this franchise saw an opportunity to make some money and dragged this story into two full-length movies when in reality just one big two and a half hour movie might have been handled more neatly and effectively.

In Part 2, Bella and Edward's love-child brings a conflict between the Cullen family, the pack of werewolves lead by Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) and the Volturi cult led by Aro (Michael Sheen). Having not seen the other films or read the Stephanie Meyer books, I could never follow why being immortal would be a threat to the Volturi vampires or how the vampires inexplicably gain powers like chopping logs like a cheese cracker, superspeed, or super-jump. It also didn't help that the visual effects are far below the standards of a Sci-Fi channel movie, demonstrated by the werewolves, motion blurs, the backdrops, and the baby. Another list of stupidity: Bella learning to act human, the elemental powers that contribute nothing to vampirism, the ethnic stereotypes, and the climactic battle near the end which was all a vision. The only redeeming and entertaining value in the whole series so far is Michael Sheen, who bites the scenery gloriously and even has that silly hammy laugh as an act of threat. While nicely shot and not with some crazy and funny moments, Breaking Dawn Part 2 is still a poorly written, poorly acted and poorly directed mess.

3043,Jacob B,"Aug 21, 2019","The best Twilight film...mostly owing to the fact that it's the last one of these suckers (no pun intended). There's a final battle that's actually quite badass, despite being remarkably gore-free for an all-out massacre...which then leads to probably the cheapest movie cop-out I've ever seen in a movie, though I won't spoil it for you. Michael Sheen has more screen time after being limited to just two scenes in the terrible New Moon movie and only allowed to have a Marvel-style mid-credits scene cameo in the last movie. And, the movie for once isn't boring with some nice cinematography and a decent opening credits sequence. It's still not good despite being the best film but I'd rather take an average fantasy action film than a dull romance anytime. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson's performances aren't any different from what we're used to seeing from them at this point, the ending is probably not as happy as Stephenie Meyer and Bill Condon seem to think it is and it's clear the special effects budget was dedicated to just the final battle because Bella and Edward running looks abysmally fake and the CGI baby is much more creepy here than in Part 1. Did I mention the cheap cop-out? I think I did. Glad to get this franchise over with though I might see the adaptation of The Host, seeing how the book is written by the same author. It is fascinating to see how a series that was always generally considered to be not good still managed to have movies that were all hugely successful at the box office. While there have been good first films followed by a series of crappy sequels such as Transformers and the Resident Evil movie series, Twilight was considered to be a bad film franchise from many detractors since day one yet the sequels still managed to show up amongst the 10 highest-grossing films of the year from 2009 to 2012. We might never get a definitive answer as to just how popular this series ended up being but for the time being, let's all take a moment and feel either relieved or sad that this series has come to an end.",The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 - Movie Reviews

The director Roland Emmerich had once again proves he is the master of making big budget disaster movie flops like 2012 (2009). The absence of Will Smith due to his appearance in the even worse film Suicide Squad (2016) really ruins it for me.

I don't know where the studio brass' collective heads were when they green-lit this movie but my best guess is that they took a jump to the left out of a time warp. Never the less, everyone's favorite Sunday afternoon movie is back with a new chapter starring Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman reprising their roles as David and President Whitmore along side Liam Hemsworth, Jessie T. Usher who plays the son of the absent Will Smith's character and Maika Monroe as Whitmore's daughter. Also returning are Brent Spiner and the incomparable Judd Hirsche as David's father Julius. In short everyone is here to take on another swing at the alien menace who, in response to their crushing defeat in 1996, have sent in a call to their home planet for reinforcements. The biggest stumbling block this movie has is just how impossibly late it is. The original film, despite it's flaws, had a lot going for it with it's white hot cast, adventurous spirit and unique story. It didn't matter that a computer running Windows 95 could somehow interface with an alien spaceship or that Vivica A. Fox and Boomer the dog avoid a trillion degree fire by hiding from it in a closet or just how impossibly racist Judd Hirsche's character was. It just felt right at the time. This movie however is just so long overdue that it's no longer the cute as a button baby that we would have embraced with open arms had it come out in 1998. Instead, it's an overweight 34 year old man with a mustard stain on his horribly faded Blues Traveler t-shirt. The overall story feels dated, juvenile and ridiculously out of place especially when compared to the films that came in it's wake over the last 20 years like Edge of Tomorrow and Battle Los Angeles which believe it or not is a better film than this. The action is confusing, the story is limp and certain characters make returns only to die or unceremoniously be written out of the story for no real reason at all. There is an extremely interesting side plot dealing with an ground war that the aliens fought with human forces in Africa which would have made an incredible film in and of itself but that bit is forsaken in favor of more cameos and another far more convoluted story line that ends with an even more unbelievable and convoluted cliffhanger. Ultimately I can't really recommend this movie to anyone other than the biggest of big ID4 fans.

The look into a magical government was also nice. The ""Fantastic Beasts"" part of the film was great. The other part, dealing with society and politics, was quite disappointing.

3150,Puroo R,"Jun 15, 2021","I have just finished watching the movie on Prime Video and everything is absolutely fresh in my mind right now. I had no idea what I was going in for. I didn't read the original book or watch any trailer before seeing this movie. All I had heard was that this takes place in the same universe as Harry Potter, which is why I watched it. And honestly speaking, this movie is nothing different from what I expected it would be. The problem with this movie is that it's very, very cliched. It uses those exact plot points that make an annoying movie, well, annoying. That's literally how this movie begins: Making an annoying creature do things for which the protagonist gets in trouble. This is just like how Dobby was in The Chamber of Secrets, except over there he was doing it because he had been asked to do so. The marsupial mole over here wasn't doing it for any particular reason at all, except for being cringy. If I were Newt I'd have just let him get caught and die. And then of course, Newt is unregistered. The way the movie began made it seem like Newt was a complete idiot, except that the whole point behind his character is that he's smart. He's the only one person who cares about the beasts of the magical world unlike the zoophobic wizards. Every species in this whole movie - muggles, wizards, magical creatures - everyone was unlikeable. They all did things which made me want them to get their comeuppance. The only thing that saved this movie for me was the world building. I have heard that the book is actually a guidebook for all the creatures living in their universe. So this, being an adaptation, was the only good part in the entire movie. And it was so beautiful that I enjoyed this otherwise irritating movie. I really wish that was the main focus of the movie instead of them being about fugitives running from the law and something something Ezra Miller. Another thing I really liked about this movie is the depiction of the 1920's America. All the characters looked like they belonged in that age. The ignorant, hateful behaviour of the people from that time was very well depicted, if that was intentional. The acting was great. People reacted just like how they would if the CGI was present before them in real life. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a movie that seems to be more oriented for a young audience, since they are the ones who will find it more appealing. It has cool and cute animals, funny scenes, childish storyline and overall the 90's and early 00's vibe to it. It's a one time watch for the adults, since the only good thing to offer for a mature audience is the phenomenal CGI. It won't remain as interesting if watched for a second time, which is why I'd recommend you to not ruin the experience by watching it for the second time.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them - Movie Reviews

I firmly expected them to not completely recapture the magnetism of the main series as there was practically no chance with an entirely new cast, and I wasn't itching for a continuation of the franchise I'd loved as I'd just seen the old ones. Redmayne made for an enigmatic leading man, though I wasn't enamored with Waterston and I never truly understood the appeal of Farrell. The CGI is very good, particularly the non-creature stuff but the beasts are good too when not sitting right next to a real animal, like the Niffler near the beginning. The clear intent with this one was to worldbuild, which I found mildly unnecessary (and a bit obnoxious with them exchanging Muggle with No-Maj for No-Apparent reason), but I liked the plot itself for the most part too. They seemed to stay a bit too long in the suitcase each time they went as it started to feel like an entire universe was inside and that they may set one of the movies exclusively in there, but that would be so far removed from reality that I doubt it'd be very entertaining.

3160,Meydiana R,"Mar 15, 2021","No story & too much CGI I have to say that I am really disappointed of the movie as a whole. The Harry Potter movies are easily one of the best and most rewatchable movie franchises so far. And this movie is sadly nothing like the original HP movies. The only thing that is has in common are the special effects (for the apparitions). There was no real dialogue between the characters. Just silly one-liners and the occasional humorous remark. I am also very angered by the fact that they just introduced a new concept (obscurials) to the HP franchise that would literally change everything (if obscurials exist why hasn't Harry Potter become one? After all he fits the criteria). There was also way too much CGI in the movie. It became a real nuisance after a while. Especially because it wasn't even ""up to today's standards"". My final critique concerns the overall flair of the movie. It just didn't feel like it belongs to the magnum opus that is the HP movie franchise. And righteously so; why did they film it in NYC? The HP franchise is the most British thing since James Bond and Doctor Who. I never really realized it before but now that I watched this movie it became very clear to me. You can't just change the location like this and expect the audience to embrace it. Sorry. What's next? Fantastic Beasts in Japan? No thanks.

Esta trata sobre el Príncipe encantador que quiere venganza por lo ocurrido anteriormente, lo cual me gustaba al inicio como una motivación para el villano pero solo lo convirtieron en un tonto en vez de un villano serio e intimidante. Los personajes que nos presentan son mas de lo mismo, que no buscan trabajarlos en su tonalidad y que buscan rellenar la trama con algunos chistes malos e innecesarios; aunque hay chistes muy buenos en la película. Se le puede destacar la animación y lo entretenida que puede ser. La música esta vez no es tan buena como las de las anteriores películas y hasta sentí un intento de copiar la misma formula que antes pero mal hecha. Los nuevos personajes no me gustaron para nada y tuvieron escenas innecesarias. Sacaron el protagonismo de las otras películas que tenía Fiona y eso no me gustó nada. Por ultimo, el final con el discurso de Arturo deja mucho que desear y parece sacado de la nada para darle un final abrupto al conflicto.

3188,Puroo R,"Jul 11, 2021","Shrek the Third was the first Shrek movie I learnt of. I always used to see the Shrek franchise as something of a fairy tale, one that I can't possibly like. There were many reasons why - Shrek looked ugly, the animation wasn't exactly what I'd call 'gorgeous', and the little me couldn't tolerate seeing a princess beat up soldiers (I know, it happens in Shrek 2 and Shrek the Third but I couldn't tell the difference). So I finally watched it, just to see what all happens in it and why exactly does everyone meme it so much. I liked the first two so much that I decided to watch this movie too, and it was... meh. Shrek the Third started off really well. But the problem with this movie is that, well, it created an expectation too high. The first five minutes were actually very good, with Prince Charming grieving over his mother's death and everyone mocking him. But immediately afterwards it changed to the bad guys deciding to hate him for being bad. This didn't make sense, because that's literally what bad guys do. And then the bad guys unite to wreak havoc and... Remove a stamp? It looked like a joke that could have been in any other movie. Speaking of jokes that could have been in literally any other movie, there are plenty that happen over here. The king dying and then coming back to life before dying properly, Shrek throwing a champagne bottle at a ship making it sink, Puss explaining how babies are made, Shrek and Donkey threatening the librarian (I still remember seeing that scene in the trailer as a kid), Puss and Donkey not being restored to their original bodies completely in the end and of course, the entire plot of Arthur being a loser. But of course this movie isn't absolutely terrible. I really liked the speeches that Arthur gave; once at the campfire when he and Shrek talked about their lives and once in the end where they defeat Prince Charming. The part where Puss tries to look cute when he's in Donkey's body and the soldiers get disgusted was also hilarious. I also enjoyed the part where all the princesses come together to storm the castle. I hated that scene as a kid but now I find it funny. Shrek the Third is the only 3rd movie of a franchise that I have ever realised wasn't as good as the previous ones. I watched Spider-Man 3, Star Wars: Episode VI, Despicable Me 3 and even played Batman: Arkham Origins, and I really liked them all as much as I liked the other two. It doesn't have quite the charm that the first two movies, for that matter all the other three movies have. It's a pity that I really wanted to like this movie, but it seems too mediocre.

3201,Italian G,"Mar 13, 2021","This review contains spoilers. According to many Shrek the Third represents the lowest point of the franchise. And they are right. I'm not saying this is a bad movie. It is simply meh. The continuation of the story is perhaps a bit too banal, but in full swing with a familiar continuation. The animations are very good, but nothing comparable to the latest films. The known characters undergo practically no evolution, both Shrek and the others, but donkey always remains the nicest, even if honestly it is less than the other films. the king's death scene is perhaps the most hateful scene in the franchise that wasn't funny at all but just pissed you off. The parody continues, even if it is less intense than the previous ones 2. I don't have much more to say: Arthur is a decent character, Prince Charming doesn't suck as a villain, but he's not on par with his mother and the story is pretty predictable in many places. It seems as if this film is only cheaper than the previous ones by not giving anything really innovative. But it's not bad. it is watchable.",Shrek the Third,Shrek the Third - Movie Reviews

3231,Mr F,"Oct 07, 2021","Starting with the most important thing about a comedy based movie: this film is endlessly hilarious and even when one joke doesn't work you know there are at least five coming up that will and that when they do work, they REALLY work. This, and the similar ways the premise is used, makes this film very similar to its predecessor but it's not quite as good in a few ways: the characters aren't boring but aren't as fleshed out in some ways, the beginning doesn't set things up badly but it's pretty obvious what will happen and it's a little less funny. Despite this, the movie is still really entertaining through it's fast paced but still mcguffin based plot and really well done performances from everyone involved. On top of this, the movie looks really cool and realistic which adds to the tension it builds, which it does really well especially in the Baboon scene. Although it definitely trys to expand the universe in which it takes place, it definitely could have used some different ideas and a MUCH better villain which is weird because this was my biggest problem with the first one. It builds to a well deserved if not a little long conclusion that left me genuinely happy about the sequel that will hopefully come in a couple of years (with covid you never can tell). What a hilarious fantasy that lives up to the previous' reputation.",Jumanji: The Next Level,Jumanji: The Next Level - Movie Reviews
3232,Stephy S,"Sep 22, 2021","A minor improvement upon its predecessor, Jumanji: The Next Level is still good fun but almost an exact carbon copy of its forerunner, that's both its biggest strength and weakness. The cast this time around is even better, returning actors deliver even better performances and the newcomers blend in without any issue. The chemistry they share has gotten even better and it's still a delight to watch! The special effects haven't changed much, they're still phenomenal but not any better than its precursor, mainly the intricate designs for the fictive creatures and the expansive landscapes were pleasing to look at. The pacing, however, is just as awful as the original, it still tries to pull off that videogame level style but hasn't improved in the slightest compared to the original, it's still just as clunky and makes some scenes unbearable to sit through. The life system they introduced before is back and this time they've improved upon it but it's still flawed. The twist of making them swap the number of lives is a unique idea but there's still no form of tension and they again get rid of those lives by killing them off for comedic purposes. The action sequences on the other hand are probably the best part of this movie, especially the bridge escape scene! They're hysterical and chaotic but not to the point where it's unclear what's going on all while making use of each character's unique attributes in a fun and quirky way. The soundtrack was just as much of a banger as before, Guns N' Roses is back and even more fun this time around and the orchestrated themes are even more exhilarating and hype! All in all, Jumanji: The Next Level is a solid thrill a minute blockbuster with enough to leave you satisfied.",Jumanji: The Next Level,Jumanji: The Next Level - Movie Reviews

The ability to connect with the original Jumanji, while also introducing a new audience to the world of Jumanji through a video game platform was interesting. Next Level returns to the same formula as Welcome to the Jungle, which kind of makes the film lose the charm and unexpected fun that came with the previous film. Next Level delivers on performances again, with Kevin Hart's character mimicking Danny Glover being a huge highlight. The action sequences are fun, but they seem repetitive, as we already had seen these character go through peril before, even with the avatar switched shenanigans making it funny. It's pretty nice to see Karen Gillan and Jack Black being in more of the forefront for the majority of the film, as it helps provide both performers more scope to showcase their comedic talents. As for the film itself, it's still a fun ride with a lot of great jokes, but it's just missing something. It seems like the movie was made as more of a bridge for the sequel (which looks like it will go back to the basics and familiarity for some of the older fans of the series).

3285,Milhouse V,"Jun 23, 2021","I think this film is really where the series begins to hit it's stride. It has expanded the world from the last film, but not so far as to distract from the story, and at this point, enough of the world has been established that it's not as distracting as it was in Chamber of Secrets. This allows the film just enough room to breath and everything is seemingly working in harmony with each other. While the films have gotten progressively darker, it is done appropriately so. Harry Potter is growing older and more experienced, so his day-to-day problems as a wizard should reflect that--all the while edging closer to his confrontation with ""He who won't be named"".",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - Movie Reviews

3288,Nguyen D,"Jun 14, 2021","LUMOS MAXIMA!! Let there be light. The third in the franchise, and we followed Harry Potter and his friends in their third year. It's worth noting that the director changed from Chris Columbus to Alfonso Cuarón. Even though this is the third, I'm still amazed at the new magic tricks that the source material created. They also became goofier and funnier. The CGI was decent for the most part, but some were noticeably bad. The biggest change from the first two was the story, which became more complexed and involved playing with time. This came with a problem for me: in the first hour and a half, I felt like the story was going nowhere, and the pieces were random. However, the ending act tied everything together and explained what happened a lot, perhaps more than it needed to, but probably for the young audiences to follow. Even though it's 20 minutes shorter than the second one, the runtime still felt very long, mostly because of the set up that seemed to go nowhere at first. It would be better if the story moved faster and connected the pieces sooner. Overall, I'm still amazed at how well and creative the script and source material used its universe to entertain audience. The story was more complex, which was good and enjoyable, but nonetheless still felt too long and lost me couple of times. 7/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - Movie Reviews

Cuaron is an excellent director who can seemingly turn his hand to any sort of film that comes his way, and as with every film in the series there are some good newcomers here - Emma Thompson is only briefly seen but is very good; Gary Oldman is a fine addition and the introduction of the Dementors marks the arrival of one of Rowling's most powerful, enduring and meaning-packed creations.

The film interested me from the first minutes. This movie is about Harry Potter. All parts of the film tell about the life of the boy Harry and how he fights the evil of Voldemort. The film shows a devoted friendship, as Harry is always helped by his friends and never abandoned in even the most difficult moment. The performance of the actors is so convincing that it makes you believe that it was all real. Many moments in the films are very moving and even make you worry about the character. Many moments are very spectacular, especially when Harry confronts Voldemort All the parts are very interesting and magical in their own way. In each part, the story of Harry Potter becomes more interesting, each part makes a lot of sense. This is the most interesting and gripping film from the first minutes.

3298,Puroo R,"May 12, 2021","After watching The Chamber of Secrets I was a bit skeptical to continue watching the franchise. That was what I had in mind when I began watching this - Will it also show filthy, cringy characters? Is there going to be terrible CGI with literally no beautiful locations? Are there going to be tons of disgusting scenes? Turns out this movie is better in terms of all those things. And definitely worth a watch if you haven't done it already (I know you muts have, I am the only 90's-born stooge who still hasn't watched this series). The story this time takes a much dark, complicated turn. In the beginning of the movie itself Harry kills his aunt, or so it seems since it has been left ambiguously. He doesn't even hesitate from using his magical powers to scare his family anymore, although it is never explained how his uncle knows that he's not allowed to use his powers. This time, just like every other time he is to escape from home and go to Hogwarts station. But this time he does it in a bus being driven by a ghost. I like how every time Harry has to escape from home it always happens in a funny and wholesome manner. Those are the scenes that I could watch forever without getting tired. As the series is progressing, Harry Potter is having a higher budget, which is clearly visible by the fact that now it is following the ""show, don't tell"" principle of storytelling way more often. And that's why the story is using a lot less runtime giving exposition or conversations but rather on actually doing things. I learnt this the hard way. I was doing my project on my computer while watching the movie on the phone, and I missed a lot of scenes and had to rewind to see them again. This is a habit that I had developed from the last two movies of the franchise. And I'm really happy to see that supposedly the Potterheads must have really enjoyed seeing it in the theatres or wherever they saw it. They wouldn't have wasted any time on the talkikng scenes like sci-fi movies normally do. However, I am more used to having Harry Potter having a simple story, just like the movies of that time like Narnia and Lord of the Rings. I was doing a project while watching the movie on my phone, so I stopped seeing the movie for like, 5 minutes and by then everything had changed. I never understood when Harry and Hermione went to the past and what exactly were they trying to change. I also didn't know who that guy was who sat on the flying creature and flew away. Also what finally happened of the Dementor, I completely missed out on that part. There is something about the Harry Potter movies that stops me from wanting to watch them, and I have no idea why. I also get this feeling with Stuart Little and Narnia. So I can't say for a guarantee that I will rewatch it to watch the scenes that I skipped. Although this movie is a major improvement over Chamber of Secrets, it doesn't match the standard that Sorcerer's Stone has set. I have heard enough about Harry Potter and how much it means to everyone, but personally for me it's not a franchsie I could possibly bond with for some reason. I hope I change my mind soon after future movies.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - Movie Reviews

Johnny Depp reprises his role as Sparrow, but doesn't succeed at giving the character the charm he has from the first movie in the franchise, though it may be the way the character is written. Javier Bardem plays the villain well, but some spoken lines early in the movie were hard for me to understand. Geoffrey Rush does a great job as always. The writing for this film seemed to make things up as the movie went on instead of maintaining or expanding the lore from the previous films, like playing a game that the rules change while you're playing, it wasn't really fun.

The movie also introduces us the a new villain witch is a intresting villain. But the movie chickens out and makes the same mistake they did with black beard, instead of prolonging their new story. Jack Sparrow is visually there on the screen, but I never felt the itself in the movie. Barbosa is given a nice story arc, but it's rushed and could easely have lasted two movies.

Barbosa is the character who wants to kill Jack (because everyone always wants to kill him). In the first movie, Jack wants to recover his ship, which is ""the black pearl"" that is commanded by Barbosa (in that movie the bad guy) whose character is hated, but in the end we all love him, he kidnaps Elizabeth (thinking that his last name was Turner), which continues to appear in the other films. Barbosa the black pearl and the crew are cursed for stealing and they spend a Mayan treasure that was given to Hernán Cortés when he arrived in America, and they try to remove the curse while Jack tries to take the ship from them and William tries to take his lover Elizabeth, it is a saga Very interesting because it combines fiction with some legends of the sea, which I find funny in some places, since Jack always tries to put a funny tone to problems.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales - Movie Reviews

There are many famous actors in this film. Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, Javier Bardem as Captain Armando Salazar, Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa, Brenton Thwaites as Henry Turner, Kaya Scodelario as Carina Smyth. The plot is very unpredictable. The undead Captain of the Silent Mary who seeks revenge on Jack Sparrow and try to steal the Trident of Poseidon to kill every pirate at sea. All the battles take place in the sea, which is very unusual. Dialogues between the characters are on pirate jargon with hard humor. It looks very convincing. Also, there are many surprising moments, for example, the death of one of the main characters. The end of the movie was amazing. While watching a film, you can't get dull.

One such reviewer said this was copied from 'Mac and Me'. All it takes is two minutes to do your research and to the person that posted that - don't spread false info. Mac and Me was released in 1988 and was a blatant rip off of E.T. This movie is a true masterpiece. I first saw it back in 1994 and it stuck with me since then. I miss those times terribly, however I can imagine how amazing it would have been to see it in cinemas back then! It is one of the best films ever created accompanied by one of the best soundtracks to ever be recorded. It is charming, funny and tear-jerking and the plot is straight to the point with each scene executed beautifully! This movie is a must watch and an all time-classic.

Steven Spielberg logra un gran trabajo y se complementan de una manera genial junto a la partitura de John Williams. A pesar de la inclinación de Spielberg por la manipulación barata, E.T. es en realidad una película bastante buena. En cuanto a lo que no me gustó es que algunas escenas duran mucho más de lo necesario (la persecución en bicicleta o mucho del inicio de la película que me pareció muy lenta) y algunos de los actores jóvenes ofrecen actuaciones no muy buenas (a pesar de esto, Drew Barrymore es genial).

Despite Spielberg's penchant for cheap manipulation, E.T. is actually a pretty good movie and manages to hit most of the right notes. It's the story of an alien who's been left behind after his ship departs Earth in a hurry after a threat from humankind and the relationship he develops with the young boy who finds him. Some scenes go on for far longer than necessary (the bike chase, for example) and some of the young actors give less than stellar performances (despite this, Drew Barrymore is great), but, overall, it's an entertaining family film that leaves you feeling satisfied, for the most part.",E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial - Movie Reviews

3368,Andrew R,"Apr 24, 2021","Simply put, ET. THE Extra Terrestrial is THE best film of the 1980's and one of the greatest American films of all time, as well as one of the most beautiful and innocent. It really deserved to win both the Best Picture and Best Director Academy Awards of 1982 over Ghandi. And Drew Barrymore deserved an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Her performance at SIX years old is simply amazing and so natural. Here in 2021 it's easily forgotten what an event ET was during the summer of 1982.....and the fact that it held the top spot on the worldwide and domestic box office for a staggering record of 15 years, until the release of Star Wars in January 1997. Any film holding the domestic box office record for 15 years now is unthinkable....although The Force Awakens $936 million seems completely untouchable now. People also forget ET was really a tiny little film, made for under 10 million dollars in 1982...somewhat low budget even in 1982. But with the king of the box office, Steven Spielberg at the helm and John Williams' INCREDIBLE Oscar winning score, ET soars like a $100 million dollar film. It's larger than life. And while we're talking about John Williams' score, incredible, powerful, triumphant and heartbreaking all at the same time. I would call his music to ET the greatest film score of all time if it weren't for Star Wars (1977). Most of us who grew up with the film know all the stories about the inception, inspiration and production of the film so theres no reason to repeat what countless reviews have said about the film. This review is strictly about the importance of the film and the pop culture phenomenon it became. Those of us who are lucky to be old enough to have seen it during it's original theatrical run in the summer of 1982 will never forget the experience. It's one of the most vivid memories from my early childhood. I remember it like it was yesterday. I saw ET for the first time on my 5th birthday, July 19th 1982. I was taken to Walmart before the film for a Skelator He-Man action figure and Castle Greyskull playset. I went to see it at the Belle Meade Theater in Nashville Tennessee, one of the oldest and nicest theaters in the south. I remember bouncing out of the car in excitement, the hot, humid summer evening air hitting me, and the bright orange summer sunset. We sat in the upper balcony, which was my first experience in a theater like that. I cried the entire way home, and my mother had to read me the ET storybook to get me to fall asleep. There are some things you never forget. And the first time seeing this beautiful film is a memory those of us 43 and older will never forget. ET will always be the true box office champ to me. And if you disliked or hated this wonderful achievement in filmmaking then I feel sorry for you because you have a cold, black heart.",E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial - Movie Reviews

The special effects and stunts are also so real - Tom Cruise even: broke his ankle in mid-air for a stunt and continued the scene, and learned to fly a helicopter for an aerobatics-stunt scene. That's what I like to call dedication right there, and it really lacks in most action movies.

Tom Cruise continues his run of insane stunts, this time jumping solo from 30,000 feet.  While the rest of the white-knuckled action is spread throughout the ever-expanding cast of MI characters.   The most notable additions in this installment are Vanessa Kirby as a mysterious intermediary, and Henry Cavill as a supposed CIA hitmen that plays more like an alpha male meathead. Kirby adds to what was already a phenomenal female talent pool, and for my money, is the real reason to continue to give these movies a chance.  Kudos to Cruise and the MI producers for helming a series that offers up female roles on par with their male counterparts.  And within the storylines themselves, it's the femmes that truly rule this former boys club, and the entire production is better for it.   Unfortunately the main storyline of a nuclear arsenal gone rouge falls flat.  Been there, done that.  After a slow start dominated by unnecessary mansplaining of the overly convoluted plot, things eventually settle in.  And they do mostly stick the landing, with an ending that wisely returns to the emotional bond of the MI core.",Mission: Impossible - Fallout,Mission: Impossible -- Fallout - Movie Reviews

3422,Abhay D,"Mar 03, 2021","One of the best directed action movies in recent years, certainly one of the best in this decade. Usually, sequels get worse and worse. Mission Impossible is the one of few movies I can think of that gets better and better with each part. It's almost unbelievable that the sixth sequel to any franchise looks this good and fresh. Interestingly, the director changed for each film in the series and this film is the first where the director team remained the same. The last three are very good, and this one is probably the best in terms of quality. An interesting story that requires attention, tense action scenes that are at the highest level. I must also mention Tom Cruise who is a masterful actor as well as an action star who participates in various stunts. Shooting, driving, racing, jumping, parkour, flying, the character did absolutely everything in a very tense film through his 140 minutes, which is not a small amount for an action film. one of the most appreciated things about Cruise is that what he does onscreen is real. He really does those leaps between buildings. (He broke his ankle on one of those leaps and shut down production for seven weeks.) He really does drive a motorcycle at high speeds against traffic. He really does fly a helicopter. Who knows what motivates this guy, but the results are incredible. The music, the stunts, the actors, the cities, and the landscapes. Everything was put together amazingly well. And an ending scene that you will never forget. And, some people may find the plot quite complicated, and it is. You really need to pay attention. I recommend watching MI5, and, if you have time, all the others. There is a reference to all of them along with the movie.",Mission: Impossible - Fallout,Mission: Impossible -- Fallout - Movie Reviews

3427,Neil V,"Oct 26, 2021","2012 is enjoyable trash that I've watched dozens of times. It's laughable at times, yet thoroughly enjoyable if you don't take it seriously. It's a mix of a really interesting premise with a mess of completely unrealistic actions scenes and subpar acting. The first 30-45 minutes are actually pretty engaging. I really enjoyed the buildup and the scientific findings. Then, it just turns into a comedy fest with a father protecting his family from near-death every five minutes. I mean, if this were to have been even the slightest bit realistic, it probably would've been regarded as a great end of the world flick. Instead, the directors chose to go with the typical Hollywood approach of over-glorifying chaotic action with no regard for plot/writing. However, said actions scenes are highly entertaining in my opinion and the ending gives you the payoff of a ""warm, fuzzy climax"", while also completely unrealistic. I regularly throw this movie on to watch in the background when I want to mindlessly watch something and for that reason alone, it's worth a watch. If you're expecting to find Oscar winning-worth performances, with a brilliant cast and writing, this probably isn't the movie for you.",2012,2012 - Movie Reviews

3442,Matthew E,"Jun 01, 2021","This movie has plenty of problems, but the special effects and hyperactive plot is enough to keep anyone watching. And I'll admit, I still come back to this movie to re-watch when I want to pass some time and satisfy disaster movie cravings. 2012 has a disaster for almost everyone. You want volcanic eruptions? Check. How about megatsunamis? It's all there. I feel like that plays a big role in why I still enjoy coming back to the movie despite it not having much of anything else going for it. I'm a sucker for disaster movies. The special effects are quite spectacular. I would even say almost too over-the-top at times. But it's certainly enough to keep anyone from turning the movie off immediately. It also helps to distract from a not so great plot, which is riddled with plenty of cliches that are all too familiar in the genre. I am a scientist, and so I'm always analyzing the science behind these movies. Of course, it's science-fiction though, so it's not exactly going to hit it right on the head. I would just love to see more movies out there that are less ""fiction-y"" and more realistic. On the flip side of the coin, while the events that transpire in the movie stem from a fictional concept, I applaud the writers for coming up with something that's not horribly derivative. Can't say I've seen a disaster flick where the end of the world is caused by neutrinos heating up the Earth's core! Everything thing else... though, is more derivative and highly predictable. I feel like some of the conflicts in the plot are a bit overdone, cliche, or otherwise unnecessary. Nonetheless, it's a disaster flick that I won't stop watching anytime soon!",2012,2012 - Movie Reviews

I tried to watch this movie a few years ago. I turned it off about halfway through, just because I was weary of the CGI special effects. They're so much like watching a cartoon. This is, without doubt, the most over the top disaster film ever made. The entire city of Los Angeles slides into the ocean, Washington D.C is obliterated, and I've lost count of the other cataclysms, but there are dozens of them. As to the characters, there is a family with young kids (there always is), the U.S president, brilliant scientists (of course), and thousands of extras, most of whom get pummeled to smithereens by toppling skyscrapers or tsunamis or exploding volcanos. Oh yeah, a giant cruise ship gets decimated by a tsunami. I liked that. I've always hated cruise ships. This movie will certainly give you your money's worth. But it's basically a 2 1/2 hour cartoon. Not a funny one, either. And there's obviously no point in raising the issue of plausibility. Cartoon's aren't supposed to be plausible.",2012,2012 - Movie Reviews

3446,Molly M,"Apr 14, 2021","Roland Emmerich delivers an apocalyptic adventure to viewers in this intense, explosive catastrophe. The film makes use of various world-ending prophecies, including the Mayan calendar to rip cities in half and crumble monuments to the ground. '2012' follows various characters across the globe as they race to save whatever's left of humanity. The film opens in India, where Dr Adrian Helmsley is called to the world's deepest copper mine, only to discover the Earth's crust is heating up quicker than expected and must rush back to the United States and present this information to the President (Danny Glover). On the other side of the country, in sunny Los Angeles, is failed author and limousine driver, Jackson Curtis. While camping with his kids, Jackson meets Charlie Frost (Woody Harrelson), a man who preaches that the end is near. What happens next leads Jackson and his family on a globe-trotting adventure to China for a shot at survival. As Jackson makes his way across the globe, Government officials Chiwetel Ejiofor and Oliver Platt try to save what they can, all the while trying to maintain law and order. Despite '2012' being a high-octane action film, Emmerich still manages to display emotion. Final phone calls to loved ones provide a sense of closure to some characters, while for others, it fills them with sorrow and guilt. The 158-minute runtime can't help but drag on, and there's a few unnecessary scenes and lines of dialogue that could've been skipped. The visual effects throughout the film are incredible, even with a few issues here and there. They're extremely detailed and do a great job of getting across just how much damage has occurred all around these characters. Co-writers Harald Kloser and Thomas Wander provide '2012' with a decent score that compliments the chaotic atmosphere of what's going on on-screen. Chiwetel Ejiofor gives a great performance as Dr Adrian Helmsley, starring opposite Oliver Platt, who gives an acerbic performance as Carl Anheuser. Glover shares a heart-wrenching scene in the White House chapel with Ejiofor, where he says 'I'll be the last President of the United States of America, do you know how that feels?' A quote like that makes viewers realise the magnitude of what's happening. John Cusack gives a superb performance as Jackson Curtis, a divorced father of two who just wants to maintain a good rapport with his kids. Oh, and if you recognise the name Jackson Curtis, that's because the character is named after the rapper 50 Cent. Emmerich was a big fan of the rapper and wanted to name his lead character after him. Something that Emmerich did well with '2012' is he gave viewers two different points of view. One from the more public, working-class side and the other from the up-high, government officials. That's something that not many action films do. Despite the film mentioning the Mayan calendar and culture, the Mayans didn't actually say that the world would end in 2012. Unless you include the end of the world, the main theme throughout '2012' would be family. Jackson Curtis tries to save his family and Adrian Helmsley gets to say goodbye to his father. Tony Delgatto (played by the late George Segal) tries to reconcile with his estranged son before being abruptly cut off. The film provokes the idea that your wealth and/or job can determine your survival, and when in extreme situations, people are willing to put a price on life, €1 billion per person to be exact. There were production plans for a TV sequel titled '2013', but it was cancelled due to budgetary reasons. In conclusion, '2012' is a chaotic catastrophe with fiery scenery and heart-warming familial moments. The film features good performances from the entire cast and keeps an equal focus on both the ends of the world, and the people who are desperate to survive.",2012,2012 - Movie Reviews

The villain is also not that interesting, and the entire story doesn't feel very original, riddled with plot clichés and conveniences throughout. About the only good things in this film are the action and the humor, which I think still lands. Where this movie is strongest is when it strays from the whole ""alien"" main plot.

Neither did I fully enjoy the maya-alien plot nor every action scene in this. Shia was miscast and his performance didn't help in the slightest to make up for that. It's not a bad performance, but he's all over the map. The material he had to work with was not strong to begin with, however. Indiana Jones was something, a David Koepp script couldn't fix. The CGI gets a lot of flac for a couple of mild blunders (compared to actually bad CGI), but really isn't that bad. The departure in the end is pretty amazing. Overall this doesn't compare to its 3 predecessors. Yet, I keep revisting this movie because watching Spielberg fail is still way more entertaining than watching other directors peak. There is still much to love about this. It is by far one of the best adventure movies of the 2000s. If it had been an off brand adventure flick, people would hold it in high regards.

3505,Jorge M,3d ago,"I watched a long time ago and I had a conflict about this film, I couldn't understand why Spider-Man 2 was considered one of the best superhero movie ever. I'll be honest, I was a kid and I didn't process the film like this days, that doesn't mean that the film didn't like in that moment. Now days, I get on the train to swear that Spider-Man 2 is the best Marvel film ever. It's an amazing mix of genre which has you on the edge of your sit during all the film. It'll thrill you, it'll make you sad, it'll amuse you, it'll make you jump out of your seat in excitement. It could be said that I am exaggerating but this film is perfect in every single aspect, the script, directing, cinematography, visual effects, the performances, editing, sound and soundtrack, achieving an unique style to be the benchmark talking about Spider-Man. It squeezes all your feelings while with a gorgeous eloquence speaks us about the importance of kindness above all. It could be summarized with great tenderness with the next verse. ""I believe there's a hero in all of us, that keeps us honest, gives us strength, makes us noble and finally allows us to die with pride. Even though sometimes we have to be steady and give up the thing that we want the most. Even our dreams """,Spider-Man 2,Spider-Man 2 - Movie Reviews

I loved mjs character in this movie because of her chooses and what she needs to do. the last thing I liked is JJJ and he was more of a character than the first movie. what I didn't like is that the CGI was kind of weird at some parts and there was still some cringe acting from the actors. also I hated all those annoying screams in this movie. but other than that this movie was amazing.",Spider-Man 2,Spider-Man 2 - Movie Reviews

Peter Parker is now graduated and is struggling to live on his own, he is struggling love wise as he cannot express his real feeling towards Mary Jane Watson, this causes Peter Parker to become a really stressed person which leads him to struggle with his responsibility to be Spider-Man, he is losing his friends as they start losing trust in him. Villain wise this is probably the best out of the 3, it goes really into detail of why the villain is the villain and later on realizes all of the actions and damage he has done which makes the villain start having inner conflicts with himself as he has to pick to archive his dreams or keep humanity safe.",Spider-Man 2,Spider-Man 2 - Movie Reviews

The acting is still perfect, and the expanding of the universe is done very well. Much like the original, the CGI still feels a bit outdated to today's standards, though it was decent enough for its time. The plot and story is arguably better, and the villain is about as well done as Green Goblin, if not better in some ways.

The first 30 minutes of the movie are an absolute blast, with real humor that lets Tobey Maguire take himself a little less seriously for a while. It starts dragging a little bit as the plot picks up, strangely, but it's got bright spots here and there until the end. Alfred Molina is all around pleasant as Doc Ock, although he comes off as a little cartoonish at times. J K Simmons is amazing as always, and I appreciated the Bruce Campbell cameo. Kristen Dunst is still passable as best, although her one-dimensional, male-dominated dialogue doesn't help. Tobey Maguire still can't make facial expressions. This movie tries to introduce some interesting ideas about mental health, responsibility, and self-care, but doesn't really develop them into anything more than ""Spider-Man kicks ass whenever the plot needs him to."" Peter has a bit of character development, but he tries his darndest to avoid it until circumstances force it on him. The ending is somewhat satisfying but overly cheesy for my taste.

3523,Jonathan K,"Oct 15, 2021","It's nice when a niche movie is confident to wear its own identity loud and proud, and this was one of the main reasons why so many, myself included, loved the Sam Raimi Spiderman film from 2001. It doesn't hurt that the film was a solid bit of what I like to call Uplifting Blockbuster entertainment, but Spiderman 2 keeps what worked with the first and adds depth and greater dimension. The villain has gone from a Charismatic Evil Baddie to a Charismatic Morally-Conflicted Baddie, the evolution of Peter and his friend Harry feels logical and realistically painful, the relationship between Peter and MJ is genuinely sweet, and even Aunt May is given a lot more time to showcase her character, and her inner strength, and her scenes with Peter about his confession to her are a serious emotional gut-punch, flawlessly and organically fused with what is otherwise a feel-good superhero action flick. Let's also throw in the fact that the CGI is a massive step-up, particularly in regards to the character animation, the action scenes are notably more intricately designed and the setpieces are actually more inventive and climactic. There's also a Transition involving sunglasses that might be my favorite Transition of any movie (or anywhere outside of some used in Sherlock). This is filmmaking at its most confident and free-flowing, and Sam Raimi is one of the best quirky filmmakers of all time, effortlessly fusing a unique and offbeat sense of fun with a big-budget adventure movie for mass audiences. If you like the genre, and don't need it to be ultra dark and pensive (the latter of which this movie sometimes is, mind you), then this is an absolute must-see, along with the first.",Spider-Man 2,Spider-Man 2 - Movie Reviews

The villain is better, Dr. Octopus is as imposing as Green Goblin and I could take him seriously, there are genuinely heart-touching moments that were almost absent in the first film, and the final 50 minutes are a spectacle. But the other side of the movie, Peter Parker's personal drama, is, like in the first film, hard to watch. Tobey and Kirsten still don't have chemistry, and consequently, the romance arc is, again, dragged (I missed Dr. Octopus during a moment). And Tobey Maguire, despite everything, is not a good actor, it's hard to empathize with him. Aunt May (looks more like grandma May) and J.K.

I very much appreciate how they've developed characters in a way that any interaction between two of them feels like fanservice. I didn't think I'd appreciate the addition of The Rock as much as I ended up liking him and while I love the previous composer, I loved the addition of the grungey rock segments in the film score. The prison fight scene with Brian pulled me out of the movie as it was too obvious that they had sped up the framrate to make the movements appear faster and more violent than they were and throughout the movie the choreography involved fight moves clearly pulled right out of WWE, like the dropkick/elbow drop combo and the chokeslam and the freaking diving headbutt of all things that took away from the realism in a way that I disliked. I also thought it was absolutely implausible that The Rock's character would agree to let the bad guy go after chasing him for so long when it literally meant endangering millions of people all for one person as that's a stupid character arc and an objectively poor decision. He should've just shot the dude right away before he could call the kidnapper since that's pretty much how they prevented Mia's death anyway, jamming his phone. And the bad guy's radical switch from calculated smart guy to bloodthirsty dumb guy was poorly written.

3622,Puroo R,"May 08, 2021","It is not very common for highly successful superhero movies that explore a new genre have an equally successful sequel. Superman and Superman II, Iron Man and Iron Man 2, Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, there are plenty of examples where a great movie is followed by a mediocre or even a bad sequel. But this one is definitely not one of them. Rather I like Deadpool 2 more than its prequel. Since the previous movie was more set up in order to give an origin story and have the regular good guy vs bad guy fight, it did not have much time to explore over its humour. And this is exactly where Deadpool 2 does the job. The story revolves around Wade Wilson once again with his popping over his wife's death by a bunch of mercenaries and alongside that he is trying to save a boy from becoming a supervillain and getting killed by Cable. This movie it takes itself very lightly just like the prequel and breaks the fourth wall continuously as the story passes by. There is even a joke on Josh Brolin playing the role of cable as Deadpool says, ""Suck it, Thanos!"". Multiple comic scenes take place throughout the movie e which include the formation of the X-Force, Deadpool being made an X-Men trainee and no one taking him seriously, Wade Wilson been sent to prison, Deadpool fighting Cable and releasing all the mutants only to be ripped in half by Juggernaut and Deadpool growing out as a baby from the bottom half. The action scenes of this movie are even better than the previous one. I really like the scene from the beginning of the movie where Deadpool is fighting a bunch of Yakuzas in Osaka. The camera revolves around Deadpool as he slices down all the man who have come to save the leader. When juggernaut and colossus are about to fight Deadpool says, ""Big CGI fight coming up!"". When he is about to fight cable for the first time, Cable ask him who he is to which he replies, ""I am Batman!"". Overall there are multiple action comedy scenes sprinkled all across the movie. The movie also gives an important message, which is not something we normally see in an X-Men movie. Deadpool tells Russell to let the headmaster live, as killing him would send him on the path of villainy from which it will be impossible to come back. Instead of Russell Deadpool chooses to take the bullet from Cable and his death becomes the reason why Russell chooses to give up killing and become a good person instead. This also saves Cable's family from dying and he can go back in peace. But soon afterwards that message is discarded after the headmaster is run over by Dopinder's taxi, thus fulfilling his dream of becoming a contract killer. Deadpool 2, being the movie for a mature audience as it is, is hard to think of home to watch with, considering such a movie cannot be watched with the family and friends have watched it anyway. This is the reason why it's a good thing they decided to make a sequel of this movie and connect it to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If Dark Phoenix and The New Mutants were not made, this could have been the most perfect way to culminate the X-Men franchise and merge it with the remaining Marvel Cinematic Universe. I can't wait to watch more of this.",Deadpool 2,Deadpool 2 - Movie Reviews
3623,Simon O,"Apr 12, 2021","One of those extraordinary films that is hilarious, clever, visually stunning and emotionally potent too! The most enjoyable superhero movie.",Deadpool 2,Deadpool 2 - Movie Reviews
3624,Jonathan K,4d ago,"Deadpool shows the power of a well-written screenplay, which is fast, sharp, incredibly funny and immensely self-aware without ever staying in the dreaded ""meta"" zone for more than a few seconds at a time (like Deadpool mocking Ryan Reynolds as only being successful because he's good looking). The main hero has a woefully cynical worldview, but he is actually extremely observant, and isn't just cynical due to viewing the world via an emotional skew - there is bad in the world, from the little injustices that everybody simply lets go, to the uneven value placed on human lives based on the circumstances, and his dark jokes about these things actually feel like a raunchier version of something George Carlin might have come up with. And on that note, yes - This movie is overpoweringly raunchy, so if this is not something you enjoy, then you have no business being here. Luckily, the movie has a lot more than just comedy to offer. It features a surprisingly somber story of a mildly deformed man running away from the eyes of the one he loves, which is actually quite touching. And along with that, the movie has a fair amount of action and some moments of genuine intensity, and both of these aspects are very well done; while Tim Miller might have made the most Poorly-Directed Terminator movie with Dark Fate, his Directing of Deadpool is absolutely spot-on, nailing the humor, heart and adrenaline almost flawlessly. It's not a perfect movie, but mostly because its unique and extreme style of humor, much of it winking to the camera, is so consistent that it does eventually get slightly tiresome - it's like listening to 3 Weird-Al albums back-to-back; it's always funny, but the humor is so consistent that it just wears off after a while. But if ultra-dark and raunchy humor work for you, as does some surprisingly brutal violence, then I cannot recommend Deadpool enough. I absolutely loved it and plan on watching it numerous times moving forward.",Deadpool,Deadpool - Movie Reviews

3678,Jonathan K,"Oct 18, 2021","George Lucas isn't quite the most creative person in the history of Hollywood, but he was creative in the exact right way at the exact right time, inventing not only a unique fusion of genres (that proved way more successful than even he could have imagined) but a new type of special effects approach (moving the camera around an object, rather than the opposite like everyone else). The original Star Wars represents the pinnacle of a simple story with a hidden depth when examined closer. The world is well realized, the villains incredibly intimidating and memorable, what is and is-not possible is well established quickly, and it largely plays out as a feel-good movie with a few moments of genuine tension or drama. Mix in good performances, likable characters, awesome action sequences and some of the best audio (both music and sound effects) of any movie, and you've got a movie that has, and will forever, stand the test of time.",Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,Star Wars: Episode IV -- A New Hope - Movie Reviews

3681,Alex J,"Sep 28, 2021","What made Hollywood and gave the foundation to the sci-fingenre. Star Wars. A simple story about galatic governments, smugglers, space wizards, space ships and robots. This idea of film sounded absolutely insane in 1977. But for George Lucas it was a story, his story. That he believe was worth telling. All these years later, it sure did pay off. Not only is the film simple to follow, but the characters are likeable, then set pieces and score are fantastic. It's all great and is a solid film. I highly recommend any film goer to gives this a shot, and see what the hype is all about.",Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,Star Wars: Episode IV -- A New Hope - Movie Reviews

All of the development for the Galaxy, force and many other aspects is done in a very efficient way which allows the viewer to be excited for an expanding galaxy and hence why the franchise still runs over 40 years after this film. Given the year it was made, 1997, this movie has some very impressive special effects, better than some you see nowadays in 2021. Despite limited screen time, Darth Vader immediately established himself as a legendary villain thanks to his menacing presence and his ability to steal every scene he is in.

3686,Colton S,"Aug 30, 2021","A legendary ambitious start to the ever-expanding star wars saga, George Lucas opened our eyes to new possibilities of blockbuster filmmaking and things have never been the same since audiences have seen that opening crawl for the first time. Starting in the middle of the story(Episode IV) It is a thrilling adventure of young farmboy Luke Skywalker who with the help of old Jedi master obi-wan Kenobi follows his hero's journey and begins learning the ways of the force and become a Jedi himself as he and hotshot smuggler Han solo along with wookie Chewbacca(captain and co-pilot of the Millennium Falcon), work together with the companionable droid duo of R2-D2 and C-3PO to rescue princess leia, and help the Rebel Alliance in their fight to restore freedom and justice to the Galaxy as they go up against menacing Darth Vader and his waves of imperial storm troopers. The story is a perfect morality tale as good goes up against evil and it feeds people's hunger for adventure, thrills ,and comedy. This 1977 film is a classic and with the story, John William's brilliant musical scores and the huge leaps that it takes with special effects and other filmmaking techniques(which were many building blocks towards even better techniques for modern filmmaking) this film will live on in people's hearts and minds for generations but don't take my word for it, go out there and see it for yourself!!! no longer will you have to fear about not knowing what the force is or what a wookie is or even how many languages C-3P0 can speak, this film is the perfect first steps into a larger world!

3687,James M,"Aug 25, 2021","Some kind of movie magic happened when Star Wars was made. From the reported chaos of its production, somehow everything fell into place by the time the final film was released: the perfect cast, groundbreaking special effects, amazing sound effects, great editing, an awesome music score and a fantastic adventure story with not one, but two, very different heroes taking centre stage. Star Wars has a level of realism, showing us a futuristic world where technology is fully integrated into people's daily lives, and everything has a ‘used' look that made it seem very real. The iconic opening shot, with an absurdly massive Star Destroyer crawling across the screen in chase of some hopelessly outgunned little space ship, informed us that this was a world unlike any we had seen before - a place far, far away and in another time, just as the opening credits had promised. The central robot characters R2D2 and C-3PO were both believable and likeable. It was an inspired choice to have only one of the robot speak English, with the other one left to communicate through simple electronic beeps, leaving us searching for meaning in the robot's simple movements and head turns. Mark Hamill was perfectly cast as Luke Skywalker, the naive young farm boy who gets caught up in a galactic war with rebellious freedom fighters. Hamill's boyish good looks made him very relatable to the young fan base, many of whom dreamed of being Luke Skywalker long after they had left the movie theatre. Carrie Fisher was also good as the beautiful but sassy Princess Leia, and Harrison Ford announced his arrival as the alternate hero Han Solo. The story never labours, instead moving at a solid pace as one small adventure unfolds into the next. There are moments of genuine emotional depth, such as when Luke looks out over the Tatooine landscape towards the planets dual setting suns. as if longing for the future to arrive. There is also great action and adventure as the movie progresses to it climatic battle against the awesome Death Star. Star Wars still looks fresh today, and can be enjoyed over and over again.",Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,Star Wars: Episode IV -- A New Hope - Movie Reviews

But believing that people centuries ago sprinkled clues throughout their work, trusting that every hidden clue would survive centuries of world events (including two world wars as it turns out) and also trusting that people centuries later would find and correctly interpret and follow those clues.... What utter horse****. . Right now it's possible that i am getting my terrible films mixed up, but i think that there are even clues that could only be found because of technology like x-rays. And there is no way anyone living 500 years ago could have predicted that tech, not even DaVinci himself. . It's laughable. And this is laughably bad.

3774,Matt F,"Jul 18, 2021","Wow. Just wow. This isn't a superhero movie or even a sci fi and is not in the same genre; people must learn what that is, instead it's more like a special effects packed action fuelled fast paced blockbuster with brilliant technology, style, money and humour. You can expect the level of nonsense nowadays more so because most of the fast and furious entries lately have been too over the top they were from the start. Now, you've the very best in action stars Jason Statham who at only five foot nine took the usual hammering in terms of a roasting from the Americans. Plus you've Dwayne who looked amazing in this until the later stages when he appeared to have lost his entire pump with the amount of work he had put in. The two characters got at one another in the same way Kevin hart does which was fun at first then became tiring. The film was at its best when it was more serious. Future tip dial down the undue excess, dial down the immature phrases and dial down the special effects and you've instead of showing off all the money most of the cities you filmed in just do not have, actually use what was best in the film, old school and charisma. Special mention for the females in this movie, the extras including the army of bad guys were very poor in this almost made this comic book like, but the female lead did her part even if she was just a spare part towards the end. Statham was bound to produce coming from some silly films such as spy and the Meg, whereas Dwayne had to pump up to de-emphasise his ageing stubble, the two looked remarkable they got on well. Jason is better when he's no nonsense serious and so is the rock with that added humour and banter. Although at times this went too far like with Ryan Reynolds to be taken as a serious movie this annoyed me. The audience compared this too much to the franchise which is just as mad, finally less irrelevance on super cars and more on actually showing us just how sensational these two men are.",Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw - Movie Reviews

3787,Kyle C,"Jun 17, 2021","The first two thirds of this movie are a little bit of a slog - it takes a while for the story to get going and for the cast to really have anything to work with, and most of the action up until this point has been generic and really nothing special. A lot of the CGI is obvious and awkward. But the final act in Samoa is so exciting, beautiful, and action-packed that it pretty much redeems everything we went through to get there. Dwayne Johnson finally gets his chance to shine in this installment, showcasing some solid fight choreography while also showing surprising restraint in the humorous and emotional scenes. Jason Statham also gets a lot of redemption (as does his character), making him a lot more likable in this film than in the previous F&F installments. Although it's marketed along with and takes place in the Fast & Furious universe, this film is firmly NOT a Fast & Furious film (which is ultimately for the best). For one thing, Hobbs & Shaw is almost entirely a buddy comedy film, with a good bit of action and some emotional scenes thrown in. Ryan Reynolds is funny and unexpected, although Kevin Hart's character felt altogether unnecessary. Although it's much more of a traditional action film than what we're used to in this franchise, it stands on its own pretty well and gives the leads a chance to shine apart from the bloated cast of the main series.",Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw - Movie Reviews
3788,Dale R,"Nov 15, 2021","The origin story of the character from Disney's Sleeping Beauty animated film done in live action starring Angelina Jolie. This film is not a live action remake of the original film, instead making the villain of the original the protagonist of her own film. Maleficent is one of my favorite villain characters of all time and I wish they would have told the original story (expanded for time) from the villain's point of view. Instead they ruin the characters of the good fairies and Maleficent herself. Angelina Jolie is perfectly cast as the title character and does a great job in the role. The scene taken from the original movie when she curses Aurora as a child was really well done.

Between the hype, a sequel & Jolie, I expected magnificent special effects, adventure, and an epic character study of a good-hearted-girl-turned-evil queen. It has great effects; I will give it that. But, where the film fails is in its character-arc. Rather than display Maleficent's gradual transition, the film spends a max of 4 minutes, where Jolie goes from a weepy girl having lost her wings, to a woman limping in frustration, to an villainous queen seated on a thrown of her own making (and with a pair of body guards lookin like undead versions of Groot). This is not character development. And, there is also very little to be said for the man she loves, who ultimately becomes the rival King. His portrayal falls flat, but I'd can hardly blame. The character is one dimensional with dialogue to match. And, his betrayal, with no buildup, makes about as much sense as Maleficent's turn to the darkside. Might have to skip the sequel.",Maleficent,Maleficent - Movie Reviews

3800,Thomas R,"Sep 01, 2021","There are people here who are disappointed that this movie has no resemblance to the animated movie from decades ago...but that is presumably the intended idea. The movie is certainly scary and violent without being gory, but definitely don't take little kids to see this one. It will be quite unsuited for them. Maleficent begins life as an immature fairy in a beautiful, harmonious fairy world next to a conventional and harsh kingdom. She is visited by Stefan, a boy of a similar age from the kingdom, who implies that someday he will live in the king's castle. An innocent romance begins, but soon ends as the boy grows older, and the current ruler of the kingdom attempts to invade the fairy world with his army to steal its treasures, only to fail. As the old king is dying, Stefan claims the throne by amputating and stealing the fairy's wings. He gets the crown, marries, and has a baby daughter...only for the now-embittered and vengeful Maleficent to arrive and place a curse on the daughter. Stefan is forced to have his daughter raised by three fairies to try to keep her safe...and in the process, becomes embittered and vengeful himself. But over the years, as the daughter grows up, unaware of what had happened, Maleficent sees her and starts having second thoughts. But the cold war has started between Maleficent and Stefan; can Maleficent undo the damage she has done? Like most characters in recent fairy tale-themed movies, nobody is entirely good or evil, and everyone is the victim of the attitudes of their respective cultures and eras. Good for teenagers or above, but too upsetting for the young kids.",Maleficent,Maleficent - Movie Reviews

Angelina Jolie is obviously incredible, the visuals and CGI are mostly impressive, I really like the score for this movie and there's some really epic and emotional moments in this movie like the action scene against the king, Maleficent cursing Aurora and the entire 3rd act. It's quite impressive and can get pretty violent for a Disney movie. But by far the biggest issue with the movie is the pacing. This movie drags on so many times during the 2nd act, especially the scenes with Aurora discovering the moors and it just isn't interesting but overall, it's a good time. I enjoy it.",Maleficent,Maleficent - Movie Reviews
3812,Mitchell C,"May 30, 2021","Maleficent is such a disappointing watch for a few reasons. The first 20 minutes were icky, with the child actresses not being the most expressive. The start of the movie just felt like a huge waste of time, but when Maleficent got her wings cut off by her boyfriend who went psycho on her for a really dumb reason, I thought the movie might pick itself up. It did indeed do this... for about 5 minutes. Evil Maleficent was intimidating for a few seconds and how she put a curse on the princess for revenge, but then Maleficent kind of just picked on Aurora (the princess) and then they became best friends 5 minutes later because Maleficent related to her? Then Aurora goes to her father's castle after finding out Maleficent put a curse on her. But when Aurora gets to the castle and meets her dad, the dad just goes, ""L.O.L, I told those stupid fairies to deliver you the day after today."" And then the king just locks the princess up with no compassion at all. The final battle was pretty lame. Maleficent just drops the king, learns some stupid moral, the end. The film's pacing is really off, wasting the first twenty minutes with bad acting and a dumb twist villain, then rushing Maleficent's redemption 10 minutes later with the movie not giving you enough room to see Aurora's personality. To top it all off, the movie ends with a rushed out ending. Don't even get me started on the side characters. Everyone here is so unlikeable. For instance, the fairies aren't as fun in this movie as they were in the original movie. These fairy's just end up not even caring for Aurora. The crow (who's the best character in this movie) does a better job of looking after Aurora than the fairy's could ever do. The king is just really angry for no rhyme or reason, yes his child was cursed, but he just shoves her to the side in the final act like I just said. Maleficent her self is just pathetic, she just ends up being soft, but since she's the good guy, she actually ends up bing pretty likeable. But since she's just a big softy now, all of her intimidation she had in the original is gone. The movie takes itself too seriously at times as well, with the closest thing too funny is when Maleficent is picking on Aurora when she was little. In conclusion, just go watch sleeping beauty.",Maleficent,Maleficent - Movie Reviews

3832,Tristen M,4d ago,"After watching it for the first time in maybe 3 or 4 years and thinking about it. I don't think I hate Amazing Spider-Man 2 anymore! Is it convoluted? Absolutely. Is there too much in it that goes absolutely nowhere (mainly because they were questions to be answered in a conclusive chapter of a trilogy) yes maybe a little too much! Are the origins for the villains a little cheesy or bad? Maybe they weren't bad maybe it was just the execution of it because I could be wrong but I think they draw heavily from Ultimate Spider-Man comics. BUT the score is incredible, of every single Spider-Man movie we've ever had ASM2 is the absolute most gorgeous and visually stunning. No movie is this fucking cool looking. Andrew gave his performance 110% and his chemistry with everyone even someone giving as bad a performance as Dane DeHaan seems to work for the movie it is. Every actor gives everything they've got in this and you can tell, it's not like Spider-Man 3 where you can tell that almost nobody cared and because everyone's acting is so good in this the emotional moments do hit and they often hit hard!!! Honestly this to me has the best, most accurate portrayal of Peter Parker; funny and smart as hell that's not just trying to impress Mr.Stark, what he doesn't know we see him actually try to figure out without the solution being ""Oh Mr.Stark put this in my suit already!"" Most of my issues with this movie has always been that I hate (and still do) that a looooot of the plot is heavily solved through pure coincidence. That whole plane massacre sequence at the beginning of the movie where Richard Parker is fighting for his life to try and upload his confession video not to send it to a news station, not to send it to someone he knows will do something good like Ben or another scientist, not the police, he sends it to his private computer currently sitting in a secret laboratory under an decades abandoned subway terminal that you only have access to by inserting in these specific slightly different subway tokens that are hidden inside his calculator that Peter only found because he got mad and threw the calculator and it broke and it just so happens that the video sent was also an apology to grown up Peter. Yeah that's absolutely convoluted and even with my newfound respect and even liking for the movie thinks that whole thing should have been cut. But look at the villains, all the groundwork is there. Their stories are actually well grounded and good, it's just the performances that made them seem stupid. Max Dillon becoming Electro; he's a man whose always belittled, bullied at work by EVERYONE despite being one of the top people in his field, has no friends had to buy his own birthday cake and sing Happy Birthday to himself that when he finally gets power he can exact the revenge on those who've wronged him! That's an awesome origin story it was just the weird direction in how Jamie Fox, who I don't blame for the bad performance, director Mark Webb other than Amazing Spider-Man had only done indie romcoms. And even with the weird writing and directing Jamie Fox gave it his all. Harry Osborne his mom died and his dad never cared about him, sent him away when he was really you and rarely if ever saw him or thought about him again. The first time he sees his father in years he's on his death bed saying ""Hey, this disease I have. Guess what? It's genetic haha!"" Then he has to learn to trust Peter because everytime he's made a friend or thought he did they only liked him for his money! And I do like that subplot of Oscorp trying to push out Harry but trying to figure out how. That too is great groundwork for the bad guy. Now this I do blame Dane DeHaan for because he's reacting to everything right but there's still just something about his performance that makes it seem cringey. Paul Giamatti gave the worst performance of his career as the rhino but hey no movie no matter how great is perfect. But the fight choreography in this is Incredible, it's not like a lot of superhero movie fight scenes where either it's too dark or the camera is too shaky and you can't see what's happening or there's a lot of weird cuts and transitions that you still can't see what's happening. This was a for a while my absolute least favorite comic book movie right up there with shit like Superman 4 and Batman Forever and Robin but being that I haven't watched this in years I do admit this is now a guilty pleasure. It's by no means simply due to the plot issues a good movie but I do enjoy the good aspects a lot more now.",The Amazing Spider-Man,The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - Movie Reviews

Plus, the storyline does not make sense, the main problem being: Max Dillon idolizes Spider-Man before becoming Electro but becomes a villain after becoming Electro. 🙄 And for reasons I cannot explain, the death of Gwen Stacy just wasn't moving. Terrible handling of an iconic part of Spider-Man's story.",The Amazing Spider-Man,The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - Movie Reviews
3837,Ellie C,"Nov 09, 2021","While disappointing after the first one, the second one still has a strong enough script and an amazing cast: Emma Stone, Andrew Garfield, Sally Field, Dane DeHaan, Jamie Foxx. DeHaan was an absolute standout in this movie and he completely stole the show. His portrayal of Harry Osborn is my personal favourite- he manages to make us feel pity, disgust, annoyance, and empathy, all at different points for this tortured character. I would have loved to have seen more of DeHaan's abilities and talent in the ASM franchise. *SPOILER ALERT* Marc Webb's directing is absolutely phenomenal and genius. When Aunt May reveals that Peter's father was a traitor, the camera angle tilts- Peter's work has been turned on it's side, it has become askew. Later, when Peter finds the Subway train and finds out the truth about his father and his work, the camera rights itself- Peter's world is righted.",The Amazing Spider-Man,The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - Movie Reviews

Além de o Rhino ter menos de 30 minutos de tela em em um filme de 2,20 horas, e ser completamente desnecessário. Em contrapartida, o Electro tem uma origem que chega a ser até melhor que a das HQs, apesar de ter uma motivação meio estranha.Mas ele é um bom vilão, e é o ponto forte do filme junto com o homem aranha.",The Amazing Spider-Man,The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - Movie Reviews

Los efectos especiales son impresionantes, el spiderman de Marc Web tiene el mejor balanceo, Peter en esta pelicula tiene sin dudas el MEJOR traje de spiderman en el cine, el Soundtrack es espectacular y la muerte de Gwen Stacy hizo llorar a mas de uno. esta pelicula tambien tiene fallas, villanos como Rhino realmente no tienen importancia en la trama y salio muy poco en pantalla, al igual que el duende verde. Electro si fue un buen villano y creo que de hecho es el mejor de esta saga de peliculas, aunque pudieron haberle dado mas profundidad al personaje.

3846,Rafael R,"Oct 15, 2021","WARNING: THIS REVIEW HAS SPOILERS! The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the worst Spider-Man film until then. The cast from the first movie still does a great job, but none of the new characters works. Harry Osborn is a poor version of the emo Tobey Maguire with a bit of Draco Malfoy. The actor is terrible and his arc is badly developed and also rushed. Electro is the worst Spider-Man villain in the cinema of all time. Jamie Foxx here is as invisible as his character, who has no motivation for hating Spider-Man (Lizard also didn't have, but at least he was imposing). And the romantic arc, which was masterfully done in the first film, becomes a ""To All the Boys 3"" but with Noah Centineo's character being the protagonist. There's no history. The best things of this film are: it deepens on Peter's parents backstory, the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone still works and Gwen's death is painful and touching.

Infelizmente o filme acabou se perdendo por causa de tantos subplots envolvendo futuros projetos para essa franquia que acabou sendo cancelada... Eu consegui me divertir muito com esse filme. Acho que foi o único filme que me deixou com um ar de ""o que acontece agora""? Infelizmente o 3° filme não aconteceu, e eu sempre me pergunto como seria o 3° filme. ""Teria sido melhor ou pior que os 2 primeiros?"" O Espetacular Homem-Aranha 2 tem comédia, romance, ação. Tudo o que um filme do Homem-Aranha deveria ter. Esse filme é uma das adaptações dos quadrinhos do Homem-Aranha simplesmente perfeita, tanto que parece que estamos assistindo o Homem-Aranha ultimate em live action. A atuação do Andrew e da Emma também ajudaram a salvar o filme. A trilha sonora também não peca, Hanz Zimmer caprichou nessa. Não me arrependo do que vou dizer... Esse é um dos filmes preferidos de comic-book. Os efeitos especiais desse filme são uma coisa de outro mundo. Marc Webb nos entregou um filme ""puro"" Homem-Aranha, e ele fez isso muito bem. Infelizmente a Sony atrapalhou cortando cenas importantes para o desenvolvimento de muito personagens, como por exemplo da Felicia, ou do Max, que infelizmente acabaram sendo esquecíveis.

3856,Stephy S,"Sep 01, 2021","Even more of a mixed bagged than its predecessor, The Amazing Spider-man 2 improves on the good parts of the original like its protagonist and the chemistry between the cast, but it butchers so much stuff. The saddest part is, it felt like director Marc Webb had a clear vision for the sequel but the studio interfered and forced him to shove another villain in at the last second. Speaking of villains, one is poorly written and just lazy, and green goblin's development is just non-existent. The pacing is god awful during the second act and every subplot feels out of place, the sinister six setup feels like Sony was just trying to make more money by teasing them and the story arc of Peter's parents (if you can even call it a story arc) has no place in the story and doesn't have a satisfying pay off. Nothing we learn about them is something that subverts our expectations, it's all old news. That being said, Peter Parker, Gwen Stacy, their relationship and Gwen's death scene are all phenomenal. It's strange seeing Marc Webb being able to deliver on arguably the most powerful death scene in any movie, and then also be the man responsible for Electro and Green Goblin. There's not much more I can say that hasn't been said yet, it's corporate pandering, it's lazily written and could've been so much more if they just focussed on one villain and expanded on the dynamic between said villain and Peter. If only there had been a The Amazing Spider-man 3, maybe that would've been the golden child of the series.",The Amazing Spider-Man,The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - Movie Reviews

The last chapter to the popular Hunger Games movie series that broke literary sales records, made Jennifer Lawrence's career and influenced young girls everywhere to take up archery is finally coming to a close... well sort of. This is only part 1 of the final chapter. In it's infinite wisdom, Lionsgate films has decided to take the Harry Potter route in finishing off the Hunger Games series. What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said about the second to last Harry Potter movie? Some may call this film a necessary bridge to the final chapter of the series, others may call it a gradual build to something far grander in scale than what we've seen before in other Hunger Games films. Some may say that but the fact of the matter is, this movie is just plain old fashioned filler. Trust me, I've read the books and the only thing you're seeing in this film is pure filler. I don't think I'm giving anything away by telling you that The third book of the Hunger Games saga depicts the events of a massive war between the capital and the other districts but it's not ALL just a battle, there are quite a few pieces of plot that need to occur leading up to the epic spectacle of war, things that the makers of the Hunger Games film series would rather just get out of the way than have them share the spotlight with what is sure to be the special effects event of fall 2015. I could go on and tell you about everything else in the film as far as the cast and the story and the special effects but honestly, nothing has changed since the last film. Everyone does a good job and the film ends up where it needs to be but the overarching feeling behind it all is that it all of it adds up to being just a bunch of Hollywood BS stretching out projects for no reason. There's no real reason for this movie to exist, everything that happens here could have been explained in the first 20-30 minutes for the most part, Lionsgate just decided that they wanted to line their coffers with a little more coin before this franchise ends. Eh, who can blame them. Money is money after all. Unfortunately it doesn't add up to a very entertaining ride for everyone else in the theater. All in all, if you're a fan of The Hunger Games films, you're seeing this for only one reason, to get to part 4 where the real action is. If you're just a casual fan, I'd say read the back of the DVD case or the wiki synopsis and hell, just watch the trailer and prepare yourself for part 4 because that's what you should be paying to see, not this. Perhaps I'll have a different opinion of the series once part 2 of Mocking Jay comes out, but as it stands right now on it's own, Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 gets a 2.5...out of 5",The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 - Movie Reviews"

It makes for an intense , suspenseful political thriller that allows the viewer to take in what happens by not moving too fast. The Hanging Tree sequence is probably my favorite in the franchise, the score is remarkable and the action that is around is great.

3901,Matthew D,"Jun 16, 2020","A smart political drama to get teenagers involved in politics. Francis Lawrence's coming of age sci-fi political drama The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 (2014) is an interesting installment in a franchise built on blood, then goes deeper into social dynamics and what it takes to create a revolution. Suzanne Collins' writing is interesting as she acknowledges the need for political propaganda in order to maintain order and unite the districts. Mockingjay - Part 1 sets up for the grand finale with style and class as Katniss must film President Snow's atrocities to inform and unite all people to her righteous cause. I think Lawrence finds fresh perspective on teenagers rebelling and relating to these heroes with his slick direction. I must mention that Lorde is on the soundtrack for this movie. Her astonishing dream pop anthem ""Yellow Flicker Beat"" calls on the youth to rebel and be themselves with frightening majesty. I love how it's the last thing you hear in the movie as the end credits start to play. Likewise, James Newton Howard's score has never been more evocative and emotional, especially towards the end of Mockingjay. I love his music for this fiery franchise. Jennifer Lawrence is incredible as empathizing with Katniss Everdeen and the struggle of an oppressed people. The Hunger Games movies mean more than entertainment, but a warning against allowing your society to crumble. We should all be rising together like Katniss in these turbulent times. Lawrence is inspiring, lovely, and haunting as the distraught and conflicted Katniss trying to do what she believes is right. Josh Hutcherson is excellent as the captured Peeta Mellark, painfully tortured and forced to deliver half-hearted messages to the Mockingjay revolution. Liam Hemsworth is interesting as the conflicted Gale Hawthorne, who wants to be there for the already spoken for Katniss, while fighting alongside his people. Woody Harrelson is outstanding as the heartfelt Haymitch Abernathy, standing alongside Katniss through it all. Elizabeth Banks is increasingly emotional as the entertaining eccentric Effie Trinket. Julianne Moore is fantastic as the cold and calculating President Alma Coin. She bears a knowing confidence I find revealing. Rest in paradise to the ever amazing Philip Seymour Hoffman as the crafty architect of the Mockingjay revolution Plutarch Heavensbee. Jeffrey Wright is more clever and cunning than ever as the technical genius Beetee. Stanley Tucci is more underhanded as the propaganda announcer Caesar Flickerman. Donald Sutherland is more vindictive and vicious than ever as President Snow. His calm fury is fascinating to watch unfold on the masses. Willow Shields is very emotive as Primrose Everdeen with her hurt looks and helpful healing practices as a revolutionary nurse. Sam Claflin was awesome in Catching Fire and he's captivating with his dark dramatic performance as Finnick Odair. Jena Malone gets a memorable cameo as Johanna Mason. I wish she were in more of Mockingjay. Mahershala Ali is cool as Katniss' new protector Boggs. Natalie Dormer is cool and gorgeous as the propaganda director Cressida. Ve Neill's make-up for Dormer is so wonderful with her green tattoos and undercut hairstyle. The costumes in Mockingjay are all wicked armor with plenty to love. Philip Messina's harsh industrial production design is striking like Jo Willems' vivid cinematography. I love his wide shot of Katniss shooting down two jets with her bow. The close-up of Jennifer Lawrence's face to the jets is killer. Lastly, Alan Edward Bell and Mark Yoshikawa's snappy editing makes Mockingjay's 123 minutes fly by like the bird. In all, Mockingjay is not as phenomenal as The Hunger Games or Catching Fire, but it inspires a sense of anarchy and rebellion in you for sure.",The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 - Movie Reviews"

3906,Zach L,"May 30, 2020","Once you grow up and realize the realities of conflict, inner turmoil and the fight to do what's right, you hopefully lose any immature attachments to fleeting fancies of the heart. Sadly, this film doesn't recognize that. Collins wrote these books for a YA audience but the stakes within the plot are so high that the naive YA heart tugs are a fatal error. Katniss and Peeta's love story arc was never fully developed in the first place , so for her to be so hung up on Peters fate that it causes her to play the reluctant hero role is outright silly. There are scenes early on in this film where Katniss is screaming and crying over poor Peters fate that is supposed to make us feel for her quest for love, instead it's just a childish distraction. Had she stepped into the hero role and been mature enough to know that none of her allies had any choice in the impending revolution, thus meaning Peeta no harm, it would have been such a stronger and more well defined study in the rise of the Mockingjay. It's like you're watching a 14 year old Tiger Beat mellowdrama play out for no good reason. All that aside, the dystopian vision of censorship, power and mind control from within governmental systems is well thought out and worth the trip down the rabbit hole. The heroines conviction for the cause does bloom eventually, thank God. Otherwise, this film would be a waste of time.",The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 - Movie Reviews"

It never was about stupid kids shit it was always about emotional growth. Shrek forever after hit the spot and showed us at the start what the series had become and how he grown sick of it. He then realised what he lost and for the first time in the series he cried. When she couldn't get his reality back he put his selfish self out of the picture and tried to help phiona have a better life. Rumblestinkings unlike other villains he actually won and outsmarted everyone he was a masterpiece of a villain.

3911,Pedro G,"Oct 28, 2021","Muy buena película, sin duda un digno final y definitivamente el mejor ejemplo de una obra infravalorada. Es una pena lo poco apreciada que está esta película. Creo que fue el resultado de la tercera entrega, y el mal sabor que dejó la franquicia. Al volver a ver la película, me sirvieron mucho los temas maduros que toca y su profundidad en los personajes. Uno de mis aspectos favoritos de la película, es el antagonista 'Rumpelstiltskin', quizás no es el mejor (ya que para mi sigue siendo el hada madrina) pero es muy memorable. Por otro lado, me gustaron mucho todas las escenas emocionantes que te dejan al borde del llanto, o llorando directamente. Esto hace que no sea tan divertida como las dos primeras películas, pero me gusta por donde llevaron esta película, dándole un toque diferente. Por otro lado, la película no iguala a la primera ni obviamente a la segunda, pero por lo menos es un digno final de la franquicia y no es olvidable para nada. También me gustó mucho el soundtrack de la película y la animación es genial, se nota una gran evolución en cuanto a las anteriores y que se gasto mucho mas presupuesto esta vez. Destaco mucho también el doblaje latino que sigue siendo muy bueno. Por último, el final es muy satisfactorio, dejando un mensaje hermoso y un montaje musical con la misma canción del final de la primera película; concluyendo con los créditos mostrando escenas icónicas de toda la saga, simplemente hermoso. En conclusión, una película incomprendida con un final muy digno que se mantiene fresca gracias a las hermosas animaciones, el gran desarrollo de Shrek y una buena historia.

3939,Italian G,"Mar 13, 2021","This review contains spoilers. I honestly don't understand all this hatred of the movie. I didn't grow up with the Shrek saga: during the lockdown I saw all 4 films in order. And for someone who saw the film for the first time, I found it a great product. The animations are a big improvement over the previous 3 films and the characters are beautiful to look at. The story is very controversial, but I found it to be in full swing with the franchise, because let's be honest: Shrek never really changed his temper. It certainly hasn't stayed where it started, but evolution is minimal. Here, finally, he manages to have a real evolution in line with the character. In my opinion, Shrek has not undergone a regression, but only a wave of nostalgia that blinded him. The idea of going back is what the franchise needed: going too far was a huge risk. So, instead, they eliminated the damage of a third sequel. The remaining characters are well adapted to the other reality and donkey always remains the best. The villain, the focus of the film, has a very good characterization and his plan is very well done. On one issue, however, I can agree: it is less parody and more serious. But that's exactly what the franchise needed as an ending (for now). With the fourth film, the franchise doesn't lose the whammy, it stays fresh thanks to the beautiful animations, great development of Shrek and a good story. An underrated masterpiece.",Shrek Forever After,Shrek Forever After - Movie Reviews

Honestly the idea of bringing the characters who have been on an adventure for the past two films ending up in a circus feels mediocre. The film once again keeps the same flaws with the poor pacing, the lack of character development, the hit-or-miss jokes thrown out of nowhere, and the message it tries to tell. However the movie does have more charm and better animation quality. There is one scene that nearly blew me way visually at the circus when Alex, Marty, Gloria, Melman, and the rest have their final performance.

Gold waiting to be found, but their accents were distractingly below par, especially in McDormand's case. Sacha Baron Cohen as a lemur having a whirlwind romance with a bear voiced by Frank Welker of Scooby-Doo fame might have looked good on paper, but reeked of unoriginality and never once provoked so much as a smile.

3965,"Jul 22, 2020","I only have vague memories of watching the first Madagascar movie with some friends and their kids. At the time I thought it was kind of cute, but mostly forgettable. I certainly didn’t think it was going to spawn an entire franchise of films and TV shows, but to my surprise it did. One of the sequels was Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted. And, for the record, I did indeed watch this without seeing the 2nd movie in the franchise. I don’t think much context was needed because this movie is its own insane thing. My distant memories of the first Madagascar film told me that it was all about them wanting to escape captivity to live in the wild. As a result, I found it quite odd that the entire plotline of Madagascar 3 was structured around the heroes wanting to return to their cages. I guess they felt they had a level of fame in the zoo, and they wanted to be loved and adored by humans again. In order to earn their way back to the US they decide to join the circus. There they meet some new friends that love them and accept them as part of the act. From that point on, I’m sure you can write the rest of the plot for them. It’s not an original story, and I found it rather boring. There’s been a trend in many animated films lately to include fast-paced insanity instead of story or actual comedy. This annoys me tremendously, and gets me cringing rather than laughing. Madagascar 3 is a poster child for this film-making style. Everything is moving at a mile a minute, and we’re asked to laugh just because it’s weird. I cannot even recall a single joke that worked in the film, and the story was utter nonsense. As one small example of the stupidity of this movie, somehow the animals all make it from Madagascar to Monte Carlo (I guess by swimming there.) Yet they must go through the entire plot of joining the circus, and working to make it successful enough to tour in New York, in order to make it back home. I understand the real goal of the film-makers was to get the animals in a new and interesting situation, but they couldn’t even invent a decent way of getting them there. I was so detached and disinterested throughout this entire film, despite the fact that it has some decent voice talent. Sadly, they were all performing their voices in an exaggerated fashion, so it was rather obnoxious. There were times when I was actively trying to ignore Madagascar 3, so that I wouldn’t be annoyed by its frenetic idiocy. Maybe this stuff works for kids, but for me it was tedious, to say the least.",SHOW MORE,Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted,Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted - Movie Reviews

From the amazing cinematography to the Oscar-worthy Score, this movie is one of the best to come out this year. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is one of the most mesmerizing performances I've ever seen on screen, the way he depicts his character is not realistic, but also deeply dark and disturbing to viewers. This man is able to creep out and disturb the audience just by laughing. No music or special effects needed. The plot, though flawed and at times unrealistic, is very, very dark and disturbing.

3988,Jacob B,"Aug 10, 2021","Hell to Pay has its problems such as Harley Quinn feeling pointlessly shoehorned in, an excessive cast of characters despite the short runtime and a somewhat convoluted explanation behind an otherwise really good plot twist but the Suicide Squad's third film outing following Assault on Arkham and the 2016 film is still tons of fun. Not to the same level as the kickass James Gunn film I saw two weeks ago but it's another good showing of why DC continues to remain virtually unchallenged when it comes to the direct-to-DVD market. The voice acting is great as always, the action sequences are thrilling, the plot, while generic, fits Task Force X better than the generic doomsday villain of the live-action film, there are good dynamics between some of the characters, the quips put a smile on my face and last but not least, the movie actually tries its damnedest to justify its R-rating unlike The Killing Joke and Justice League Dark, which were honestly less violent than the crazy stuff shown to us in Flashpoint Paradox. Thank God I'm not squeamish to these kinds of things, otherwise I'd have come out of cinema showing of the equally bloody, if not gorier, 2021 film a gibbering, nervous wreck. While slightly inferior to Assault on Arkham, Hell to Pay still succeeds in doing what the 2016 film failed to do, give the Suicide Squad the film adaptation they truly deserve that truly embraces its source material's ""no-punches-pulled"" nature.",Suicide Squad,Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay - Movie Reviews
3989,Puroo R,"Jun 09, 2021","Before I begin to review this movie I would like to take a moment to tell how much I lived under a rock when it came to superhero stuff. So as a kid I never liked superhero cartoons. I always found them over the top. So I had no idea whatsoever about superhero stuff. I thought Batman is just like Superman except he wears a mask, Superman is weak af because I always used to see him get beaten up every time I skimmed through the cartoon channels and saw a glimpse of Justice League or Superman. And the best part - I didn't even know what DC was. I used to think all the superheroes are made by Marvel. So when Suicide Squad was announced in 2016, our teacher had asked us which movie we want to watch. I had said Rustom (a Bollywood film) while the rest of the class said Suicide Squad. I had seen posters of Suicide Squad and I used to think it's just some mindless action film like all zombie movies. So my friend told me it's gonna have Joker in it. I combines two and two together and understood that Suicide Squad is a DC movie. And no, my stoogeness is still not over (wait for it): I was now excited for the movie, because I thought Joker will be played by Heath Ledger! So of course, then we know what all happened. The movie was bad, everyone lost hopes from DCEU, yada yada. But anyway, why I brought this story up is because my very first introduction to Suicide Squad was by the 2016 movie, and that's surely not a good way to be introduced. Sure I understood the concepts, but I had no respect left for the franchise. It's like learning about Green Lantern or Fantastic Four from their movies (...okay, I'll admit. That's how I learnt about them too). So now that I was watching DCAMU, I was a little nervous from watching this movie. But then I thought, let's just go with it. What's the worst that can happen? And surprisingly this is way better than the trashy movie. Now don't get me wrong. I'm all in for the Ayer Cut, provided it fixes that movie. But now I have already been introduced to Suicide Squad the wrong way and nothing can fix that. This is much better. Finally this was the movie that brought the Flashpoint Paradox back to relevance with the rest of the DCAMU movies, which was otherwise never talked about again. The whole Ticket to Heaven storyline was awesome. Everyone was dying at some point, so it was very thrilling to root for any one character. Although I had a hunch that Harley Quinn and Deadshot will never die since they didn't die in the movie either, yet I was really tensed for them. This is in spite of the fact that I don't like either of the two characters. But seeing them all travel in a bus and interact with each other for the first time was very nice to see. The animation, fight scenes (especially Zoom cutting down Bronze Tiger in the end), everything was so awesome. It's nice to see how much DC can do if WB does not keep meddling it. If this movie didn't exist, or rather should I say, if I had not decided to become interested in superhero stuff and not just looked at what the normies are looking at, I'd have continued to hate Suicide Squad. The Suicide Squad, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, the possible Ayer Cut - I'd have hated them all and not even bothered to see them. Thanks to this movie I have become a lot more accepting towards this franchise and can now watch it without the fear of getting bored.",Suicide Squad,Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay - Movie Reviews

""Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay"" seems to suffer that same fate but in a way that still leaves the film entertaining. On the negative side, the film has some really awkward character animation and some really horrible 3-D animation. On the positive side, however, the story is great and does a killer job of connecting itself to one of DC's best animated films, the voice acting is fantastic, and the action and content is able to be exciting and dark without it feeling like it is being gratuitous in nature. Basically, it is one of those rare occasions where DC manages to deliver an R-rated feature that doesn't feel like the goal was to get an R-rating but rather tell a great story that just so happens to get an R-rating.

The Suicide Squad team is pretty good for the most part. And the hard R rating helped out as well. My favorite part of the entire movie is Reverse Flash. I loved him in this movie. But he was so much weaker, but for a good reason. I won't spoil why. But I'm glad it shows he would've beat everyone if he was at his full strength. And even in his weak point, he still was stronger and better than anyone else. But other than him the movie is pretty meh and boring at times. The team keeps you entertained with their banter and jokes at least. Deadshot is also pretty good. This movie way better than the movie version of Suicide Squad that the DCEU had.

4052,Jean L,"Jun 30, 2021","X men days of future past is easily one of the best x men movies of all time and marked the return of Bryan Singer to the franchise after several disappointment entries after his departure. This film is solid and probably underrated featuring great direction, a great story and a large cast that unites the original x men trilogy cast of Patrick Stewart, Ian Mckellen, Hugh Jackman, Halley Berry with the prequel cast of James Mccavoy. Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, and Nicholas Hault. All the performances are great notably a delightfully funny and witty small appearance by Evan Peters as Quicksilver, James McAvoys tortured performance as young xavier, and Michael Fassbenders almost superior interpretation of a young magneto rivaling the charismatic Mcckellen. The movie sends Jackmans wolverine back to the past to meet with young xavier played Mccavoy to stop a future apocalypse. This movie is fun as it brillianly goes back to the past and present weaving between the two separate casts and trilogies in an epic way. Jackman is great with the prequel cast serving as the bridge between the two franchises. The movie has its weaknesses as the story can be devoid of logic and a lot of plot holes created by previous entries. Yet it features great drama, and lots of action that turn this movie into a superhero epic. Easily one of the best in the franchise.",X-Men: Days of Future Past,X-Men: Days of Future Past - Movie Reviews

No setting up characters, just expositon done right and the best part of the movie is definitely the story and pacing. It's awesome seeing the older and newer X-Men cast and it's such an engaging story (and it's a time travel movie) with perfectly clear high stakes. You're always on the edge of your seat, wondering what'll happen, making the movie unpredictable and it's perfectly paced. No scene is too short or fast. The acting, visuals and action are absolutely marvelous with so many cool mutant powers. It's really compelling as well seeing a broken Charles with a great character arc, a Logan who steps into the role of mentor, an awesome Quicksilver scene and it once again explores the relationship with human and mutants and time so well and that 3rd act is phenomenal. I always wonder how it's going to end.

4059,Puroo R,"Apr 15, 2021","I'm gonna be a little too honest here: I bingewatched all the X-Men movies, so I often forget about this movie. Many times I get confused when someone mentions a scene from this movie, and I'm like, ""wait, it happened in THIS movie? I thought it happened in First Class/Apocalypse!"" And I'd prefer admitting that it's my fault than it being the movie's fault. X-Men: Days of the Future Past is what I'd call the movie that bridges X-Men: First Class with the other canonical movies, and at the same time also helps in eliminating the bad movies like The Last Stand and Origins. The movie begins with, as usual, mutants being attacked and eliminated. So to save all of them, Wolverine goes back in time and stop Mystique from killing Bolivar Trask, a defence contractor. Wolverine reached the 1970s, when he was still a mutant without vibranium. And to set planes in motion, he has to find Charlex Xavier, Magneto, Beast and Mystique. Bolivar Trask used Mystique's powers to create Mutant Hunting Robots. In the beginning they were only meant to be used to fight in the Vietnam war, but seeing how Mystique and Magneto revealed themselves, they decided to use the robots to hunt down the mutants itself. They didn't see whether mutants are also sentient beings or not, they just wanted to have them eliminated. And that's when the roles of money and power play. It was on the order of President Nixon that Bolivar decided to make those robots, which President Nixon had ordered only because of Bolivar's influence. So in a way it was a loop of blame. And when Professor X, Wolverine and Quicksilver reach Magneto to save him, we finally get to see the fabled Quicksilver scene, where he takes down all the prison guards single handedly. It was the most iconic moment from the movie, and no amount of appreciation can praise it as much as it deserves. The modern day scenes were also adding to the tension, and in the end when Mystique is left with the choice whether to kill Bolivar or not, it is a quite tense moment whether the mutants in the modern time will survive or not. In the end we see that all the mutants who had died in the previous movies had also come back to life, and the franchise was brought back to where Bryan Singer had left it in X2. Normally it is very difficult to reboot a franchise (read Sonic 06). Not only do you have to understant the major events that need to ve removed in order to fix the franchise, you also have to make the reboot-turning movie really good, otherwise it will just contribute to being the hot garbage that the other movies of the franchise are. And that's the reason why I believe this movie is underrated. It single handedly fixed a failing franchise, joined the acclaimed prequel into the main timeline and became a success both critically and financiallly. It deserves to be one of the most iconic X-Men movies.",X-Men: Days of Future Past,X-Men: Days of Future Past - Movie Reviews

Well-told with a strong good-vs-evil theme appropriate for children (no blurring of the lines here) and morality lessons about bravery, selfishness vs selflessness, caution with strangers, etc aplenty. Some have argued some of the acting was subpar but it wasn't a big deal to me. The music is appropriately majestic and the action retains your interest throughout.

4069,Dale R,"Nov 14, 2021","Four children from London escape the bombardment during WWII to the home of the Professor. While there, they discover the wondrous world of Narnia inside a wardrobe. The children actors do an excellent job in the lead roles, especially Georgie Henly who played Lucy. Tilda Swinton, James McAvoy and the voice of Liam Neeson are also standouts. This is truly a wonderful adaptation of the book. The special effects are hit and miss, you can tell several heads are giant practical effect masks, some green screen scenes are obvious and some of the character animation is off. But the hits are spot on! Aslan's eyes are beautifully animated as is the rest of him and the Beavers as well.

4070,Thomas R,"Sep 18, 2021","C. S. Lewis was the author of the Narnia story series, which was meant to be a ""Lord Of The Rings""-type scenario for children. Lewis himself wrote about religion and was a convert to Christianity later in life, but the Narnia series was not necessarily intended to be an allegory about Christianity, contrary to popular myth. Degrading death and rebirth of someone is obviously not exclusive to the Bible. I mention this because the novels (which I haven't read) and the movie are simply epic adventure stories. So how are they on their own merits? The establishing parts are good; siblings living in London during the Blitz are sent to safety in the countryside, and while playing they discover the title magical kingdom. Unfortunately the children don't really engage us, nor does anyone else, and the story is rather confusing. Worst of all is the ending, where the kids have grown into adults during their time there, but when they get back to their home, they are kids again. Huh? Special effects are okay, but that was about it. Go see Peter Jackson's ""Lord Of The Rings"" instead.","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe - Movie Reviews"

4085,Saad Aman S,"Feb 27, 2021","Book adaptations tend to belong to four categories - the highly flawed commercial successes which the real fans of the book hate with intense passion (Percy Jackson, I'm looking at you), the critical and financial flops (A Wrinkle in Time, Artemis Fowl), films that have a separate passionate fanbase from the book and tend to lean towards the successful kind (Harry Potter is one good example, Winnie the Pooh) and finally - the guys who get picked up, shelved around, are always ""in development"" and never see the day of light. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe was neither. It wasn't a Harry Potter, and it wasn't a critical mess. It also was produced, and merited itself even more films. And after doing all this, it stays true to the adaptation. Fair enough, Christian parents would be a little disappointed seeing their favorite theologian novelist's book getting adapted into what is more of a pure light fantasy and less of a biblical allegory. Although Arsalan is still revered in a similar fashion, the overall aesthetic is far more Lord of the Rings than it is The book of John. It is cinematically well-done, from the bombing of London, the cigar-smoking landlord to the insides of the land of Narnia. The characters do tend to be forgettable though. Not from a depth of good acting or that they aren't fleshed enough - they are fleshed way too much. The White Witch is of course my favorite (from a narrative standpoint and not moral or personal whatsoever) when it comes to the main characters, and Arsalan does a pretty decent job too. It has several heart-warming moments to watch and utter ""Aww"" to, but the only thing it lacks are more LOL moments. Overall, a 3/5 and would say it is pretty fresh.","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe - Movie Reviews"

4089,Nurzhamal K,"Dec 08, 2020","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe This magical fantasy, released in 2005, is a gorgeous screen version of Clive Lewis's novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The film directed by Andrew Adamson turned out to be really beautiful, full of magic, breathe-taking story and interesting characters. Due to expensive and high-quality special effects, the film ended up with a big budget of about $ 180 million. When I first saw this film ten years ago, I was completely captured by this story, and loved it forever. Four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, are sent by their parents from London to the village to an old professor - a friend of the family. Once, playing hide and seek, the young heroine Lucy discovers a mysterious wardrobe, thanks to which all four find themselves in the fabulous country of Narnia, where fantastic people, animals and creatures live. It turns out that this peaceful country is under the rule of the evil Witch, because of which it is always cold and eternal winter. Children must help King Aslan, the Great Lion, who founded Narnia many centuries ago, defeat the Witch, break the spell and free the inhabitants of Narnia. I wanted to pay attention to the visual effects, special effects, make-up, scenery, the whole atmosphere in the film - everything was done just perfectly. Watching this fantasy, as if you really find yourself in the magical world of Narnia, in which you want to stay forever. To summarize, I want to say that the film is thought-provoking, spectacular and well-filmed.","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe - Movie Reviews"

There's a great battle scene in there, some fun characters and strong effects. It's a tad too long, but not by much. It has a nice charm to it also, as they set up Narnia excellently. The quartet of children are very well cast, all four of them suit their roles to a T. Georgie Henley is sweet as Lucy, while William Moseley and Anna Popplewell fulfil the roles of Peter and Susan comfortably. Edmund, meanwhile, is of course annoying, but Skandar Keynes does a good job portraying him. Elsewhere, Tilda Swinton and Liam Neeson are terrific casts as the White Witch and Aslan. Both do great, especially Swinton. James McAvoy, Ray Winstone, Michael Madsen and Rupert Everett are smart choices too. I've, as far as I'm aware, never seen the two sequels so very much look forward to seeing what they have in store for me.

4095,Alef M,"Jul 26, 2020","Um bom entretenimento. O obra ,como um todo, faz um bom trabalho no que se diz respeito a caracterização. Mesmo esperando mais do reino - artisticamente, ainda sim temos alguns cenários bonitos, uma trilha sonora excelente, uma cinematografia de gênero, junto ao figurino e as criaturas. O filme não se leva muito a serio, devido ao foco no publico mais infantil. Os personagens não são muito bem desenvolvidos. Edmund tinha uma grande potencial, podendo ser bem complexo. Assim como Pedro - que inclusive, fica mais sem graça ainda com a atuação de William Moseley. Não conheço a obra literária, mas acho difícil que esses personagem sejam tão fracos lá - numa medida de comparação. A vilão não é tem um impacto tão forte quanto deveria, mas Tilda Swinton dá alma a personagem. A voz de Aslam, Liam Neeson, acrescenta um peso absurdo. Sabedoria, um certo tipo de aptidão paciente, força; É, de fato, um ótimo trabalho de dublagem. James McAvoy faz bem o seu trabalho. Mesmo não tendo muito espaço, ele estava irreconhecível. Mesmo com alguns furos, uma vilão que só servia de antagonismo, e protagonistas relativamente fracos, a obra é divertida e passa o tempo. Senti falta de uma lição ao publico infantil, mas isso já é minha preferencia de proposito.","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe - Movie Reviews"

I love how Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy all work together when in danger they always keep each other safe, and they always support each other. Peter saves Susan and Lucy from the wolf. Also, in the battle, Edmund saves centaurs, fauns, and animals by sacrificing himself and destroying the witch's wand. I also like Lucy. She is a good character because she's kind and forgiving and always wants to help people. She forgave Mr. Tumnus. The parts that aren't in the movie makes me sad because I was really looking forward to seeing some of those scenes, like when they were playing with Aslan in a big ball of love and joy.","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe - Movie Reviews"
4098,Finn H,"Jun 24, 2020","MOVIE The movie The Lion,The Witch, And The Wardrobe is disappointing. The worst part is that the creators took all the joy out of it and replaced it all with wars and battles. In the book The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe, you don't actually see the battle. Instead you see joy and happiness, but the movie focuses on violence and war. The courtyard scene with giant Rumblebuffin and the lion who said ""He said us lions"" is missing. So is the scene when the children, who were now adults, talked strangely, for example when Peter said, ""For in all my days I have never hunted a nobler quarry."" Instead they speak very casually. I do not like how the creators changed so much of the book. It ruined the whole movie this way.","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe - Movie Reviews"
4099,Arthur M,"Jun 20, 2020","It is one of the rare cases in which it makes no difference to read the book first or see the film first. Both make the other better, and as an adaptation, the Disney movie is simply flawless. Each line of each scene in the book was accurately transcribed on the screen, also accurately transcribing the emotions and sensations of each moment in the way that C.S.Lewis endeavored to do. But besides being an extremely faithful adaptation to the original, this film also has its universe expanded in a coherent and aggrandizing way to the story it is telling, with several original scenes being created for the script. Scenes that add context, deepen the characters, make what is epic more epic, what is magical more magical and what is deep deeper. It is no exaggeration to conclude that this film is probably the best adaptation of a book ever made.","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe - Movie Reviews"

4108,Dale R,"Nov 15, 2021","This prequel to Monsters, Inc., tells the story of how Mike and Sully met in college. The biggest draw for the first film was the relationship between Sully and Boo, and while Mike and Sully's relationship was interesting, not continuing to develop Sully and Boo was a disappointment. The choice to make a college fraternity movie out of this franchise is interesting on the same level as making a spy movie out of the Cars franchise. There are also several plot points that do not mesh well with the set up from the first movie. On its own, this movie has some great comedic and emotional moments. The voice acting is great and the animation is amazing as always from Pixar. There is a scene during the third act that shows Mike and Sully sitting in front of a Moon lit lake and it is absolutely beautiful!

La animación sigue siendo muy buena. Lo único que no me gustó fue que decidieran hacer una precuela antes que una secuela en la que me hubiese gustado seguir viendo al personaje de Boo ya que era la esencia de la película junto con Mike y Sulley.

4121,Jacob R,"Jun 27, 2021","Ok so….this movie has some great moments. Is that enough to call this a great movie? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no. This movie has two things that I think are truly great, being the theme and the ending. The theme of the natural (Sully) vs the hard worker (Mike) I think is great. They should use that in more of their movies, I wouldn't mind seeing that again. The ending also portrays to this theme, showing how Mike still found his passion in scaring by coaching other monsters. If only the rest of the movie was like that. First, the animation and voice acting is still stellar. The story and everything that has to do with them being in college is boring and predictable. It's just 80s college movie stereotypes, and I don't want to see that in a Pixar movie, I'm sorry, I just don't. Also the jocks vs the nerds stereotype with the scare games is another thing I just don't want to see in a Pixar movie, again, I just don't want to see that….AT ALL. That made this movie from a good and entertaining one, to barely serviceable. This is just another Brave to me. Just like that movie, I would only watch this movie if you want to say you've seen them all. If not, I'm sad to say, this is another one I would skip. To be honest, this feels like an appetizer before the next big Pixar flick.",Monsters University,Monsters University - Movie Reviews

However the ending of this movie is actually really good and mostly the best part of the movie, but overall the movie could've been better. 7/10",Monsters University,Monsters University - Movie Reviews
4123,Puroo R,"Jun 16, 2021","I never got to know this movie existed. I used to live under a rock back when it released. So the moment I learnt that Monsters Inc has a prequel, I immediately watched it with my sister. We didn't know what we were going to witness other than the fact that the title itself says it's from the time Mike and Sully were in college. And it really stood on our expectations. It's funny, adventurous and has the character development that we want to see in a Pixar movie prequel. This time around Mike is the protagonist. His life is shown from the school days to studying in college and then finally getting a job at Monsters Inc. Seeing him really reminded me of my own days of school, which is the reason why I liked his character so much over here. Sully is like one of those normie guys whom I'd always choose to stay away from in my school/college days. I absolutely hate people like him. And that's what made me side by Mike even more. But eventually as Mike and Sully became friends and took part in the competition, I began liking Sully slowly. He's the kind of a character who may act like a douche, but is not completely bad. He does not behave that way because he himself wants to. He's just doing it because he thinks this is what will make him popular. Coming from a big family he never understood the way normal people behave. And once he became friends with Mike, he slowly began to change. Although he still didn't trust Mike, because of which he cheated to make Mike win by adjusting the dial of the scared child. The ending was actually pretty unexpected. I was thinking they will graduate from college and then become employees at Monsters Inc. After all, the college name sounded just like the company. But the ending seemed completely random and hilarious. They slowly rose up to the ranks, answering the question within the last 30 seconds. I watched this movie about 2 years ago and I have very little memory of it. So I can't exactly remember every single detail that happened in it. I can definitely say that this was a very fun movie, although not exactly memorable. I'd say Monsters University is a good movie, just like all the other Pixar sequels, if you're a fan of the previous movies and want to watch something fun for the whole family. It's quite surprising no one takes its name when talking about Pixar sequels. They only say Cars 2, Finding Dory, Incredibles 2 etc. I wouldn't have even known about it if I didn't open the Pixar Wikipedia page and scrolled through all the names of the movies that I wanted to bingewatch. This movie is definitely something I'd watch again if I get the chance.",Monsters University,Monsters University - Movie Reviews

The new characters were decent, but the story itself didn't feel very original. Voice acting and atmosphere was average. However, the music was nice. The movie starts becoming more focused in the latter stages of the ‘Scare Games' when stakes feel higher and this is where characters begin to develop their one-dimensional personalities. Also, seeing a more realistic art style in the landscape when Mike and Sully visit the human world was unique. I liked the idea of the B-movie cabin in the woods horror scene to scare adults. It gave the movie a fresh change. I didn't find the underlying tones, mood, or humour that you'd expect in a Pixar film, and there was little that would appeal to adult viewers.",Monsters University,Monsters University - Movie Reviews

4134,Italian G,"Mar 12, 2021","This review contains spoilers. Monsters University exists. Luckily it exists. Let's clarify immediately that I loved this film to madness. I really like the US collegiate environment and I really enjoyed seeing Monsters Inc's monster world again. So why didn't I give it 5 stars? Because unfortunately the film has flaws, but there are also great merits. First of all, the animation is of great quality and the amount of monsters created is impressive. The moral of the film is the thing that needs to be given more credit. We have always been used to messages like: always follow your dreams, do not be discouraged by difficulties, become someone. And then comes Monsters University which teaches you that we have impassable limits and that we shouldn't believe too much in dreams. Only this, for me, should be shown to all children: it is a really important message. The film is divided into 3 acts: Mike's arrival at university, the scare games and at the end the surprise with the two protagonists who face the human world for Mike's aversion to the fact that he doesn't scare anyone. All three acts are well done. Honestly my favorite is not the third act, as everyone thinks, but the second: all the games are great and Johnny Worthington III, the second act villain, I love it. But let's go now to the painful notes of the film. The film already contradicts itself in its existence: in Monsters Inc Mike says that they met well before university. But here it is necessary to specify how they knew about the sentence and tried to create a link anyway, which however was too forced. So I can perfectly understand why they didn't. The new characters added, except Dean, are poorly characterized and are not given much space. Most of all I would have liked to know more about Johnny's past and why he bullies Mike. Moreover, even the members of the ozma kappa themselves do not have three-dimensionality. Randall, however, forms the lowest point in the characters. I love Randall at Monsters Inc, but they made some serious mistakes here developing him. He is presented to us as kind, shy, however the opposite of how we all know him. So during the vision I wondered how they were going to change his temperament. Well, he becomes a popular monster thanks to Mike and therefore has access to the ROR group (Johnny's fraternity so to speak). So, during the games, I honestly didn't see any gradual changes, but it seems like suddenly, during the final game, Randall totally changed his character. Don't tell me that failing to scare Sulley's retaliation is justifiable. An early-film Randall wouldn't have taken it so badly. If you wanted to radically change Randall, maybe I would have put the background on ROR or I would have already shown a different character at the beginning of the film. Because in my opinion the influence of the RORs is no excuse. The relationship between Mike and Sulley is really well developed, even too much. Perhaps the real problem with the film is precisely that: they thought too much about Mike and Sulley leaving out the other characters. That said, the film, despite its flaws, managed to do the most important thing, which is to make you fall in love with the characters and the film in general. A student plot, Pixar-branded animations but above all a morality worthy of the study make Monsters University a very good film despite the superficiality of the non-main characters.",Monsters University,Monsters University - Movie Reviews

The CGI is also improved upon in this, as is the world-building with the introduction of the teased city Zion. However, where this film falls short in comparison to the first is the story, which feels more predictable and bland than the original.

I thought it would be a disaster but honestly, it was correct without being absolutely fantastic like the first one. I think that the story wasn't good and that is why it wasn't really good. Too much useless moments and it is long for nothing. Honestly, it could have been 1h45 and it would have been better. Also, I think Neo has too much power. I mean, he can be the One without being a mix of Superman, Spider-man, Batman and Black Panther. He revives Trinity, ok. He flies, ok... He fights thousands of Agent Smith, well that is a bit too much. Also, I think the VFX are worst than in the first movie. Some moments were animated like in the Polar express and I didn't like it. I know it was impossible to do it differently but that made me under appreciate the visuals. Now, I really liked the script. It was richer than in the first one. Keanu doesn't just ask questions and there is some really nice lines. Especially from Morpheus. More sci-fi and thought-provoking talks and I like it. To finish, like in the first one, I just love the unrealistic fights because they are so insane, bizarre and nice. I also enjoyed hearing that fantastic voice of Agent Smith.

No. There's some great worldbuilding like the addition of Zion. I love the design and it's awesome seeing the free human city mentioned in the first movie and it was also great seeing the people freed from the Matrix and what they suffered through including some of the politics. The action and choreography of this movie is outstanding with the freeway chase being the standout and while some of the CGI is poor, the effects are incredibly impressive for the most part, the acting is great just like the first movie, more philosophical reasons are discovered like the concept of human choice, cause and effect as well as this idea of reason and these philosophical conversations are interesting especially with the Oracle and Merovignian. The Keymaker is another interesting bit of worldbuilding and I like Trinity and Neo's relationship and seeing their love for one another and we also learned of the origins of the Matrix and contrary to popular belief, I liked the inclusion of the Architect, subverting the story from the supposed chosen one trope that was so insisted by Morpheus. All in all, it's a good sequel. It's really flawed though. There's this dance party in Zion with a ton of overly sexualized characters that's dragged on too long, the plot takes a while to get going and the fact that the movie was split into two did not help. The movie tries to do too much with its ambition and this has the whole Zion plotline as well as the machines invading it sadly forgotten most of the movie and some of the action and philosophical conversations are too long, ruining the pacing. The movie feels kind of tensionless with the lack of threat. The way Neo revives Trinity and discovers his new found power makes no sense . Neo is also so overpowered in this movie now and Agent Smith is brought back somehow and does nothing. The ending is quite unsatisfying, being rushed but frankly, this movie doesn't deserve some of the hate it gets. The first Matrix is way better but this is a good sequel that, while very flawed, has a lot of the great stuff that made the original a masterpiece.",The Matrix Reloaded,The Matrix Reloaded - Movie Reviews
4160,Taekwondo Life M,"Sep 10, 2021","This is good but not as a stand alone. I think the love of the first film and the interest in the characters and story carries most of this film. While it is a continuation of the original and seems to pick up where the original left off, it seems off point fo the importance message and mission that ended the second. We do see an expansion off the rebellion and are exposed to more members of the Resistance; however, that is not necessarily a good thing. There is more disharmony than I expected among and between these characters in light of the heroics of the original. Fishburne, Moss, and Reeves are great. Some new characters are very intriguing. Others not so much. While there is more of Agent Smith in some ways- he is much less interesting in others. The fight scenes and visuals are still stellar. The visual effects are spectacular. The music is compelling. This film does not hold up to the first- but no film really could. The real question I keep asking myself is whether this film should have been made at all. Regardless, Neo is one part Anakin Skywalker, one part Paul Atredes, and 100% one of the coolest characters in modern movies.",The Matrix Reloaded,The Matrix Reloaded - Movie Reviews
4161,Jordan E,"Sep 09, 2021","I just rewatched all three of these movies yesterday so now is the perfect time for me to review them. The Matrix Reloaded isn't a bad film at all, it's nowhere near as good as the first movie but there is still a lot about this film that makes it interesting and worth watching. I do have my fair share of complaints about Reloaded but I'll get to those at the end of my review, I'm going to explain what I like so much about this film first. For starters, The Wachowskis took the already visually stunning, intense and masterfully coreographed fight sequences from the first movie and turned everything about them up to 11 for Reloaded. The freeway chase sequence in my opinion is still one of the most suspenseful and intense action sequences in all of modern film, and the fight sequence between Neo & Agent Smith in the park after Neo's conversation with The Oracle is just straight up awesome. Before I first watched this movie as a kid I never thought I would find something like Keanu Reeves fighting a literal moshpit of Hugo Weavings so mindnumbingly entertaining. Sure, a lot of the CGI in that fight scene is kinda cheesy and dated looking rewatching it now almost 20 years after it came out, but I feel like critics who allow stuff like that to take points off of movies as a whole are way too nitpicky. I also really like the introduction to the last human city of Zion in this movie, it has a perfect dystopian feel to it. I also love the way we get to see Neo's powers evolve throughout the film, it has a very special way of slowly showing that Neo is growing to become the most powerful being in all of The Matrix. The sequence at the end of the movie where Neo's visions about Trinity dying come true and he uses his new powers to literally digitize his arm reach inside her body to jumpstart her heart and bring her back to life is really cool. But that is where my affections toward The Matrix Reloaded end and my many problems with this movie begin. First of all and this is my biggest problem with not only this entire movie but also all of The Matrix Revolutions is that it doesn't feel like Neo's story anymore. Reloaded & Revolutions seemed to entirely forget that Neo is supposed to be the main protagonist of these movies, instead he spends pretty much the entirety of both sequels feeling more like a melodramatic side character while the movies shifted all of their focus on Morpheus, Niobe, Commander Lock, and the crews of The Hammer, The Logos and The Nebuchadnezzar. This movie is pretty much all about stupid senseless arguing between Commander Lock, who might I add is one of the most idiotic and hateable characters of this entire franchise and Morpheus. The entire ""build-up"" to the war in the mediocre excuse for a third film could have been and SHOULD have been a small side-plot. Not the main focus of basically the entire movie. Also, I hate The Architect. That entire sequence needs to be removed from the movie completely. It ruins the mystery of The Matrix by literally showing you who created it. One of the best parts of the first movie was that nobody truly knew where The Matrix came from or how it was operated, by introducing The Architect in his stupid room made of TV screens the directors were literally taking 60% of what makes these movies so cool and shooting it in the face at point blank range. In my review of the first movie I mentioned how much I like the philosophical feeling that presents itself throughout the whole plot. In Reloaded that sense of philosophy is completely gone and instead everybody basically just speaks in riddles for 2 hours & 18 minutes, the worst offenders of this complaint being THE FRENCHMAN, Agent Smith and The Architect. My last problem with this movie overall is Neo & Trinity's romantic relationship. The Wachowskis couldn't write convincing love if someone held a gun to their heads. Whenever these two are on screen together they just make out like high schoolers and throw sappy Valentine's Day card level compliments at eachother and we're expected to believe they have his strong loving relationship just because the movie tells us to think that. AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THAT AWKWARD 5 MINUTE LONG SEX SCENE. Also, The Keymaker was completely pointless to the plot besides to guide Neo to The Architect, which is one of the worst plot twists in film history. Anyways, for the most part this movie is entertaining to watch for the action sequences and scenes that actually involve Neo. Other than that, this movie feels more like a spinoff than an actual sequel to the first Matrix movie. 7 out of 10.",The Matrix Reloaded,The Matrix Reloaded - Movie Reviews
4162,Christian K,"Sep 07, 2021","With the trailer for The Matrix Resurrections hitting Comic Con recently (although still widely unavailable for the rest of us) I had an urge to rewatch the sequels. Since the last time I saw The Matrix both the original directors have come out as trans (Lily and Lana Wachowski) and have since stated that the original film was an allegory about being transgender. It's certainly not a reading I considered at fourteen, I was more sold on the many different types of religious allegories that appeared to be spattered throughout the film. It will be interesting to rewatch now knowing the exact interpretation that the directors intended. Anyway I started with Reloaded. I remember being insanely excited for the film when it came out, and although it's not close in terms of having as many interesting things to say as its predecessor, Reloaded has many aspects to it that still impress. The freeway sequence remains a standout, and Neo's fight with an increasing number of Agent Smith doubles isn't quite as grating as it was the first time round. Critically The Matrix Reloaded was on a hiding to nothing on its release; however good it might have been it wouldn't have been good enough. And although many argue there was no need for these sequels, Reloaded does a much better job of following up The Matrix than it gets credit for. It will be interesting to see how Revolutions holds up; I've always been an apologist for both the sequels despite their backlash from all sides. Perhaps that sort of attitude will lend itself favourably to Resurrections on its release in December this year; I have literally no idea what to expect of it.",The Matrix Reloaded,The Matrix Reloaded - Movie Reviews

Why did Neo become Superman? Where did all the people come from? How do they manage to produce food? How come they weren't found and killed by the machines?

4169,James M,"Aug 13, 2021","The Matrix Rehashed, I mean, Reloaded, was always going to be a tough sell. Our minds were fully bent by the first film, but there was not much left in the Wachowski bag of tricks for any sequels that would allow them to hit the same highs. More Kung fu. Meh. More bullet time. Meh. More Agent Smith (literally). Double meh. In my view, there was a wasted opportunity to do something different with the Smith character, just as Terminator 2 did with the T800 (Schwarzenegger's character). For example, they could have explored the idea that Agent Smith has become an outlaw program, having been freed within the system by Neo, requiring other characters within the Matrix to assist Neo to destroy the exile program. Instead, they chose more of the same, Neo battles multiple copies of Agent Smith, but this time with unrealistic cgi fight scenes, with a muddled plot that doesn't seem to go anywhere. Spoiler alert: Matrix III dishes up even more if the same. Let's hope Matrix iV brings us something genuinely new.",The Matrix Reloaded,The Matrix Reloaded - Movie Reviews

I can't stop gasping when they were fighting or when the racing took place. If the 1st Matrix is awesome to you, this one won't stop disappoint you because it did raise a bar. - It is making the concept more difficult, tbh I still can't grasp the idea of Matrix and get mixed up with reality / matrix. How can you define reality? How do you know if it's real? I agree that the second part does not explore deeper the Matrix and explain to us what it is ( a very slight touch on at the Source scene but it is very metaphorical trust me). BUT COME ON, AT THE END CREDIT THEY TOLD YOU THERE WOULD BE A THIRD PART AND TO ANYONE'S NORMAL THINKING PROCESS, THEY WOULD THINK THAT THE CONCEPT WOULD BE WELL-EXPLAINED IN THE THIRD PART AND THEY WOULD BUY THE TICKET TO WATCH IT IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT. THAT'S CALLED MARKETING DUH? So frustrated when people do not think movies are not for profit or their main focus is just to entertain us.

4180,Jonathan S,"Mar 07, 2021","After the runaway success of The Matrix, the Wachowski sisters had the most creative and financial power of their entire career. It's safe to say the anticipation to The Matrix Reloaded was incredible. It was a cultural phenomenon and constantly the topic of discussion during free time at high school. The sequel sees Neo (Keanu Reeves) and his allies race against time before the machines destroy their city of Zion. While seeking the truth of The Matrix, Neo must face a vengeful Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving). Packed with as much visual flair as the predecessor, I clearly remember my jaw hitting the floor at the thrilling action sequences. They're full of energy, kinetic and wonderful to watch. The fight choreography is incredibly varied, mixing hand-to-hand martial arts with guns, and even car chases. The highway sequence is possibly one of the best set pieces of the past decade. The performances from everyone are just as strong as before. Keanu Reeves (Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure) delivers a somber and cool attitude of Neo. Whereas Hugo Weaving (Mortal Engines) is perfectly cast in a career-defining role as Agent Smith. He knows exactly how to best articulate the dialogue. While The Matrix is definitely a superior movie, The Matrix Reloaded is a worthy follow-up.",The Matrix Reloaded,The Matrix Reloaded - Movie Reviews

4224,Chris J,"Oct 25, 2021","F9: The Fast Saga - PG-13 (2h 23m) 2021 - Action, Adventure, Crime, Thriller 2.5/5 stars So my thoughts are kinda all over on this one. On one hand, this was exactly what the series is supposed to be. Over the top crazy, I mean the franchise inches towards crazier with each installment. I remember way back when, in the first film when they were stealing TV/VCR combos and having fun street racing. Now they're literally going to space in cars... (with little to no explanation about the issues with that idea.) This one did some fun things with returning characters, some of which I guess survived moments that are now pretty lame if you re-watch the older films. The ending was really interesting, I'm crossed because it kinda felt forced but at the same time was a fun was to pay homage to a character that doesn't appear in the film. As a whole, the story of the film was more than predictable but they never have been. The reason I didn't go lower with the rating is similar to how some of the Amityville sequels get higher ratings than most would think. I don't care if you spend $500 or $500 million making a film, if you know what the film is and play into that, then in my book it's a win. I'll continue to check out this franchise because they're a fun brainless popcorn flick and sometimes that's exactly what you need! I wonder how they'll top going to space! #f9 #thefastsaga",F9: The Fast Saga,F9 The Fast Saga - Movie Reviews

Evil geniuses with evil accents, car chases, a watch that has some sort of a magnet in it, a lair, a staggering array of incompetent henchmen, failing to actually kill Bond…. tick, tick, tick, tick tick. Lovely Bond girls presented in a less attainable or more responsible way than Connery would recognise. Great backdrops, martinis, Aston Martin V8, the Navy, M, Q, other letters, 2*007s; tick, tick, tick. Pheobe Whaller-Bridge clearly worked a bit of magic on the script, adding humour to what would have been a worthy but exhausting affair.

4241,Reba,13h ago,"While I liked Skyfall better I cannot think of a more epic or caring way to close out the Daniel Craig era of Bond than No Time to Die. Craig has brought not just a gritty realism to the Bond but also a humanity that was evident from Casino Royale and only grew as the series progressed. The humanity that was often lacking in period iterations of Bond were on clear display. If I were to criticize this movie it would be that it may have been better served as a 2 part epic rather than an occasionally rushed, but brilliant piece of action/drama storytelling.

4318,Jacqueline G,"Oct 17, 2020","On August 31, 2019, ""Ne Zha"" made the second largest box-office record of Chinese movies. So you may wonder, what makes ""Ne Zha"" so popular? ""Ne Zha"" which was a new released animated movie last summer based on a chinese legendary mythical figure called ""Nezha"" directed and written by Jiaozi. It is still on trends because of its interesting acting styles and meaningful content. As soon as I saw it, I became a fan of this movie and even watched it twice later. Nezha was chosen to be a reincarnation of a good spirit. However, unfortunately it was replaced with the evilest spirit when he was born. He showed his stubborn and mischievous nature which made the villagers panic. In the process of his growing up, the villagers had always treated him with prejudice and fear, no matter what he thought or did. The prejudice was that monsters in people's hearts can cover their eyes and can't see the truth. Finally, until Nezha tried his best to save the villagers, they really let go of their prejudices and accepted him. The reason why I like it is because it gives us some positive energy about life. Nezha said: ""My destiny isn't written in the stars, but held in my hands."" You know, maybe we all have our own destinies. However, there are still some parts of our lives that can be changed to be good if our minds are set to be so. So who are you, do you have the final say? We are constantly defined by various occasions and needs. Regarding the truth about ourselves, sometimes we have no say in ourselves. Just like the protagonist Meursault in ""The Outsider ""by the existentialist master Camus, he has no right to speak on the truth of the case he is involved in. This world is sometimes so ridiculous, and many of us in it just endure silently. Therefore, the explosive moment of ""Nezha"" must arouse the blood and passion in the hearts of the audience. We need Nezha, even if it's just in the movie. The film retains the essence of Chinese traditional culture, good visual effects; the other is the modernity and sense of humor in character shaping and language style. There is also an ugly side in the film. Compared to the truth, many people are more willing to believe in hearsay and then look at people with colored glasses. Moreover, the writer clearly used ""Ao Bing"" as a contrast to Nezha, highlighting that whether a man or a devil is an independent choice, rather than a subject that is destined by nature. Generally speaking, I take the view that this Chinese animation is of good quality and worth watching. The final product is fascinating and stunning with great humor, deep emotion, exciting action.",Ne Zha,Ne Zha - Movie Reviews

4320,Catalina D,"Sep 25, 2020","The movie of Nezha is set in a Mythical world in China. There is a powerful orb that absorbs all energy, which was meant to be destroyed by Taiyi and Shen, two immortals with great powers. It is known as the Chaos Pearl. The Chaos Pearl is divided into two opposite orbs by Yuan Shi (the primordial lord of heaven) the Spirit Pearl and the Demon Orb. Casting a spell of destruction on the Demon Orb to be destroyed in three years so that it doesn't destroy the world. Yuan Shi gives the order to Taiyi to take the spirit pearl so that it can be born into a human. The spirit pearl was supposed to be born as Nezha however due to Shen switching the orbs a young boy is birthed from the Demon Orb whose demonic nature is apparent. As a young boy, Nezha is loved by his parents who lied to him to tame his demonic nature. He is trained by Taiyi to become a demon hunter and is told that he was born from the Spirit Pearl. Becoming impatient he escapes to hunt demons where he meets Ao Bing (also trained to hunt demons) who was born from the spirit pearl as a dragon and was educated rigorously to become a demon hunter and to beware of humans. They fight together the demon however Ao Bing loses, and Nezha ends up rescuing him. The villagers however misinterpret the situation and blame all the destruction on Nezha due to his demonic nature. Nezha and Ao Bing become friends. However Nezhas's third birthday is coming, his parents throw him a birthday party and force the town to come. Shen visits Nezha before the party and tells him that he has lied to his whole life and that he was born of the demon orb. Nezha feels betrayed and unleashes his demonic powers destroying everything and almost killing his dad however he leaves to await his fate. Shen knows that if Yuan Shi finds out the truth about what had happened. Tat all of the dragon race will be condemned. So Ao bing decides to use his powers to destroy Nezha's village to erase any evidence of the events. Nezha is shown through a vision that his dad had been trying to find a way to remove the curse. In which he takes the curse upon himself so that Nezha could live. Because of this Nezha returns to his village to stop Ao Bing from destroying his village. He defeats Ao bing but spares him. When lighting comes to kill him he surrenders to his fate. However, Ao bing joins him in taking the hit of the lighting. Because of them joining the Chaos Pearl is once again united and can absorb the full hit of the lighting. Taiyi makes it possible for their spirits to survive. This story plays the themes of nature vs. nurture and choice. Even though Nezha was naturally born with a demonic spirit, didn't have many friends, and was feared and hated by his village, he was raised by good parents who loved him, taught him to control himself, and was told that he was born from the spirit pearl. So when Nezha was growing up, he had a pretty positive paradigm about himself, which led him to be able to control his demonic nature and be good. On the other, hand, we see Ao Bing being born from the spirit pearl he was told that he was going to be great, he did however have a rougher upbringing being raised by the king of the dragons and trained by Shen, and like a dragon, he was a hated creature by humans, but he was loved by his kin. When the time comes for them to know, and be faced by who they are. They have the choice to be what their destinies told them to be, or who they were raised to. Having to choose to act upon their natures, what they were told their whole life to be, or choose between good and bad. Nezha decides to act for himself and not let his nature control him, he decides to defend his family, his village, and what is right. What is interesting for me is not Nezha's struggle with choice, but it is Ao Bings. He was way more likely to be good since he was born from the Spirit Pearl, but because of the way he was nurtured to protect his kin he struggles with the choice of helping Nezha save his village or helping Shen. However, in the end, he helps Nezha and also helps Nezha's life as a spirit by uniting their powers. Overall I love this movie because of the character development presented and the message of us choosing to act and not be acted upon. It is also light-hearted and a perfect family night movie. The final rating would be 5 stars!",Ne Zha,Ne Zha - Movie Reviews

4339,Theresa S,"Dec 23, 2019","Nezha is one of the most popular and well-known mythical characters in China. Nezha appear in many myths. There are various versions of Nezha's story, and it has been adapted many times in animation and movies. But this adaptation is revolutionary. In the original myths, Nezha is a good boy, but the plot is way more violent. In the myths, Nezha is human baby borne with divine power. His father is indifferent and strict with him. One day, Hezhan caught the Dragon Prince killing children, and then he killed the Dragon Prince (cruelly skinned the young dragon alive). When Dragon King found out, it came to Nezha's revenge. The Dragon King wanted to flood Nezha's hometown with seawater. To protect the village, Nezha committed suicide in front of the Dragon King and his parents. Later, Nezha was resurrected in the lotus and became a God. Then Nazhe destroyed the dragon palace, caught the Dragon King, and became one of the Gods of War. In other versions, Nezha killed a total of 9 dragons. Comparing to the original myth, this movie is chill and light hearted in a good way. The rebellious character of Nezha is fresh and interesting to watch. This story emphasis on the lesson of ""choosing your own path"", where the original version is more about ""unconditional self-sacrifice"" and ""孝道(obedience towards elder family members)"". The revised story in the film is more in line with modern values than the original myths.",Ne Zha,Ne Zha - Movie Reviews

4349,Dave S,1d ago,"Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity is a roller coaster ride through space, a testament to the resilience of a human being in the face of unimaginable adversity. Sandra Bullock plays Dr Ryan Stone, an astronaut left alone in the vast expanse of space when her colleagues are killed by space debris. The entire film is thrilling, but the first thirty minutes are absolutely remarkable, a crowning achievement in special effects and cinematography. The special effects and cinematography are stellar throughout the film, as are the sound effects and the performance by Bullock.

Also, Bullock won a nomination for her acting? This wasn't deserved in the slightest, mostly grunting, heavy breathing, and terrible one liner cliché comments.

My biggest fear through the film was that Bullocks Botox would zit explode at zero gravity.

The films beautifully constructed shots and editing is actively being detracted from by the absolute disregard of high school level physics, a story that couldn't be less engaging and is the most basic accumulation of stereotypes (US good, Russia bad, China stupid; mentioning deceased family as a tear-jerker; sacrifice of a main character to heighten the stakes....) to try and construct a semblance of relatability for audiences. It is an affront to modern space technology, a premise that should've been outdated even in cold wars films, and a soundtrack that does nothing but horror-style tremolo strings rising in pitch slowly for 90 minutes straight. In general, the only ""thrill"" achieved by the movie to make it actually fit the description of ""Sci-Fi Thriller"" was the soundtrack desperately hammering every single horror staple home to a nauseating degree. Combine this with the unfitting joke-scenes completely subverting any seriousness that might have been left, and what remains is a hot mess of garbage that looks somewhat beautiful.

Clooney's character floating away was absurd. There was no force pulling him away. And yes, I am aware that centripetal force could have pulled him away but there were several shots that show they obviously were not spinning so that's not a valid theory here. They killed off Clooney's character just because they needed some drama. The rest of the movie is just things going wrong over and over and the protagonist finding ways to narrowly overcome it on the way to a predictable ending with some pretty forced emotion.

4379,Hendry L,"Dec 14, 2020","I remember deciding to watch this movie in cinemas because critics were all praising it as one of the best movies of that year. I watched it in IMAX 3D and remember being blown away by the movie. It won: Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing at the Oscars which is a lot of awards. The synopsis is ""Dr Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a medical engineer on her first shuttle mission. Her commander is veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney), helming his last flight before retirement. Then, during a routine spacewalk by the pair, disaster strikes: The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Ryan and Matt stranded in deep space with no link to Earth and no hope of rescue. As fear turns to panic, they realize that the only way home may be to venture further into space"". I've decided to rewatch it on a whim but this time on my home TV. The question is if this movie is overrated or deserving of its accolades. Let's talk about the concept first, it's great. A survival movie in space, with no monsters or anything like that, is such a great concept that has not been done before or since its release. The movie perfectly illustrates the horror but also the beauty of space in a way that surprisingly meshes well together. On that note of the beauty, the cinematography is amazing. A lot of amazing cinematography is usually using real shots but Gravity does it all through CGI. It shouldn't work as CGI is quite obvious and bad CGI can even take you out of the movie but Gravity doesn't ""fall"" in that category. There are a lot of gorgeous shots that feel like paintings and this is partially thanks to the amazing visual effects. The set design for the space ships are claustrophobic and further emphasise the loneliness within this movie. The score is great and elevates the tension in the scenes where the score is prominent but during the more hopeful scenes, the score is more orchestral and beautiful. The movie doesn't rely on the score too much and sometimes just lets the silence of space or the breathing of the astronauts to suck the audience into the movie and it works. The movie is visually spectacular but what about the characters and story? The movie is revolved around Dr Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) who is our point of view character. For the most part, the movie makes us care about her because of the situation she is in and that is fine. However, the director (Alfonso Cuarón) decided to include a scene that elaborates on Ryan Stone's backstory on Earth. This is a good choice as it makes the audience more sympathetic with her and more understanding of why her personality is what it is or why she does certain actions or choices in the movie. Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) is a sort of anchor character that support Ryan throughout the movie. He has a contrasting personality to Ryan as he is funny and charismatic yet due to being more experienced is also one who guides Ryan. I like the dynamic between the two of them and when both of them are interacting it's funny or heartwarming. I also have to praise Sandra Bulluck as she does a great job in carrying this movie. Her performance whenever she is struggling in space feels genuine and I can feel the fear and panic just from the tone of her voice. She also delivers in the emotional moments that bring the scene to life. She was deserving of that best actress nomination at the Oscars. George Clooney does a pretty good job as well. Although, he mostly just plays Matt as the witty and charming guy. I do like it when the two are together, George overshadows Sandra which sounds weird but that is exactly what it should be in terms of who their characters are and what the plot is asking. I don't have many flaws with the movie that aren't just nitpicking but I do think the fact that Dr Ryan Stone seems to constantly panic in the first half of the movie kind of weird. Dr Ryan Stone just seems to not know the basics of being in space so know it all Matt Kowalsky constantly has to tell her stuff that I think she should've known. From a movie perspective, I get why this choice was made so that the audience can easily understand things about space but it could've handled way better in my opinion. Additionally, we get some backstory on Dr Ryan Stone but we don't get anything on Matt which I find a bit odd and lessens the impact of a certain scene. Unfortunately, I do think a lot of the impact this movie has is sadly lost because I am not watching it in a cinema. You could argue that with a lot of movies but for me watching this throughout certainly made me think ""this would be way better in a cinema"". In conclusion, I still really enjoyed the movie. Yes, the movie is impressive because of its style but in terms of substance, it certainly is lacking. However, the movie is just so visually spectacular that I don't mind it. Furthermore, a lot of great movies such as ""Dunkirk"" and ""1917"" do similar things to Gravity and they are both great movies as well. Gravity still is one of the best space movies to have come out in the last 20 years. I feel this movie accomplishes a lot with visual effects and space cinematography. A lot of people might not be talking about this movie anymore but for me, I certainly will still remember it.",Gravity,Gravity - Movie Reviews

4414,Ben N,"Aug 27, 2021","Steve Rogers is one of the best characters to come out of MCU. He's paired up with Natasha ""Black Widow"" in this story. I love her fighting style and 'grit' but her character is simply not given enough rope to work with - I guess she needs to remain 'mysterious' until her own movie. As a result their relationship fleshes out in a way I understand but do not ""feel"". By contrast, the Captain America figure is laid bare and we can see the different factions and emotions pulling at his deep seeded loyalty. I like this story as it gives a setting to his moralistic wrangling and, like us all, he just wants to see his choices make a difference and to feel like he has agency over his own life. The Winter Soldier idea is cool - the whole Shield is a shell that has grown the enemy within is not new, but was decently executed. Falcon seems to survive too easily. Does he even have 'superpowers'? He take a ton of punishment if not. The movie is too long - of course, all of these MCU movies are too long for an action flick. But I take at least two sittings to watch anything these days since I'm on my own couch anyway, so no big deal. I knocked off a star due to that length and the fact that very important dialogue to halfway decent plot is spurted out after a gut punch, or growled through gritted teeth, or whispered while explosions go off in the background, or shouted while a crescendo of 'dramatic' music flares too often.",Captain America: The Winter Soldier,Captain America: The Winter Soldier - Movie Reviews

It all starts out with the forest wedding of Bella (Stewart) and Edward (Pattinson). This then turns in to a honeymoon with unanticipated consequences. Just way too much extended scenes and drab dialogue that should have been cut. And the inability of the two leads to barely go through the motions of acting at being in love is galling.

A lot of people and reviewers prepared me for a boring movie in which nothing happens but that's not what I felt from the overall package. Sure, the movie is just as cheesy and ridiculous in its first half and I did find myself rolling my eyes during it. However, once the main plot of the movie kicks in halfway, I thought it was pretty solid. The pace moves much quicker and the focus is taken off of the romance just for a little bit, and the movie is better for it. I am not saying this is a great movie as it still has many technical issues in terms of acting and writing, but I will say it is far better than anything this franchise aside from the first movie.",The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 - Movie Reviews

4450,Jacob B,"Aug 13, 2019","I actually did enjoy the wedding and honeymoon of this movie. I know Edward gets a lot of flak for acting like an emotionally abusive boyfriend and Bella's shown to be just as flawed with or without him and people aren't wrong about that but Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson do share surprisingly good chemistry during this section of the movie. Perhaps it's not all that surprising seeing as how this was from the director of the live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast. Visual effects ain't half-bad either. Then Bella gets pregnant. This is where it all goes downhill for me. We spend the rest of the movie at the Cullens' house once Edward and Bella leave Brazil, with a few scenes that take place in either the woods or Charlie Swan's house and I'll just say that the whole pregnancy conflict honestly doesn't feel all that interesting given that the stakes don't feel particularly high. The action being dialed down to zero compared to the relatively decent asskicking in Eclipse doesn't help one bit. The ""Part 1"" of the title is an incredibly transparent attempt to cash in on the success of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows which were both critically and commercially successful (I personally consider it to be my favourite Harry Potter movie but only if counted as one movie). And I'm sorry, a well-intentioned anti-abortion message just doesn't seem like enough to warrant the adaptation of the final book being a two-parter. Give Deathly Hallows some credit, at least there was some epic and visually stunning wizard-vs-wizard action and I actually do care about those characters and understand how high the stakes were there. And the anti-abortion message would be fine if not for the fact that the concept of imprinting means that Jacob falls in love with a creepy CGI - still better than that animatronic they were initally going to use and fortunately the uncanny valley only comes in affect when we see her up close - baby. Gee, why don't we hear a lot from Taylor Lautner anymore when his character will likely never live that down? Breaking Dawn Part 1 is not a good movie and has its fair share of silly moments, most notably the wolves speaking telepathically when there was no indication that wolves could ever actually do that in earlier installments plus it looking siller than if the VFX artists decided to animate lip movement, but at least Part 2 has an epic battle...though I do know the big twist about it.",The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 - Movie Reviews

4467,Astrid P,"Apr 15, 2017","Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 1 is a movie from the Twilight saga which originally is a serie of 4 books. They made 5 movies out of it. In my opinion it's a quite good fantasy movie but more made for young adults and teenagers. This movie was directed by Bill Condon and released the 18th of november 2011. The 3 main actors are Kristen Stewart ((Isa)Bella Swan) , Robert Pattinson (Edward Cullen) and Taylor Lautner (Jacob Black). In this movie Edward and Bella get married, she unexpectedly got pregnant during their honeymoon. This twist causes a lot of debates and fights between the recently married lovers and between the vampires and werewolves. The baby could cost Bella's life. The actors are believable, their acting skills are better than in the previous movies thus as the screenplay. They respected the books well. The movie is well shot, the camera angles are good : mostly close shot, extreme close up at the right moments (extreme close up on Bella's eyes at the end, the last image of the movie), Upward and Downward shots during the duel between the Alpha wolves, establishing shot during the wedding to show the beauty of the place and all the guests,... The soundtrack is very, very good, it's mostly alternative/ indie rock songs and a piano melody throughout the whole movie. There are percussions adding to the piano melody when actions are happening. The special effects (wolves' transformation) and make up are good too, all the Cullen have a really pale face and pregnant Bella needed to look very sick and skeletal and it is very well done.

4469,Joe M,"Jul 25, 2021","""New Moon"" is a real step down from the mediocre ""Twilight"". The worst aspect of this film - it bludgeon the audience with a Romeo and Juliet undertone and self harm as an antidote to breaking up - not a good message for teens. It has way too heavy an emphasis on the whole tortured separation between Bella (Stewart) and Edward (Pattinson), with Stewart even more wooden than in the first film and Pattinson almost catatonic. The only real plus is the added twist of hunky Jake (Lautner) 'dogging' Bella - who is just shameless in how she leads him on. The near finale in Italy really amped it up but not enough to save the film. Much, much too long - could have easily cut 30 minutes or more.",The Twilight Saga: New Moon,The Twilight Saga: New Moon - Movie Reviews

4480,Cait G,"Dec 29, 2020","New Moon, the second instalment in the Twilight Saga, is probably not for anyone who is not remotely interested in the original story. It is not a standalone film. There is much more action (although balanced out by the extreme inaction of Bella's severe depression of the first third). Chris Weitz definitely made this a more polished and big-budget looking film than the original. Although whether the polish ultimately adds or distracts from the love story is an interesting question, there are some really beautiful scenes (especially the Italian scenes with the Volturi). The actors are not as painfully awkward and have become more comfortable in their characters and with each other and that does make the the entire viewing experience better.

4486,"Sep 09, 2020","When I watched the first Twilight film I felt that it was bland and uninteresting in every way, and one thing I most certainly did not feel was interest in what happens next. It simply doesn’t feel like an ongoing saga after that first film, so I was curious to see how they would manage to continue the story when they got to New Moon. Well, it’s certainly just as boring. The one and only thing I will commend this movie for is that they at least addressed in some small way the general creepiness of the Edward-Bella relationship. Sure they just mention it in passing, and try to laugh it off, but there is a moment when they talk about the fact that a man that is literally hundreds of years old is seducing a teenager. Aside from that, there are no redeeming qualities in this film. The first big flaw in New Moon is that a large chunk of the movie involves Edward leaving and all the relationship stuff being taken over by Jacob. This is a problem because Robert Pattinson could act better than Taylor Lautner in his sleep. Lautner actually manages to be worse than Kristen Stewart, and I didn’t think that was possible. He is utterly devoid of charisma, and never once convinces me that he is falling in love. Combine that with Kristen Stewart’s expressionless staring into the middle-distance and you have the worst love story imaginable. As part of this stupid relationship we get to see Bella once again proving herself to be utterly clueless. Despite constant blatant hints and obvious clues, she is simply dumbfounded that werewolves exist. However, the more egregious problem with New Moon, and the reason it made me actively mad, is how it handles the break-up of Bella and Edward. I know it can be devastating to have your heart broken, but this film is so committed to the idea that these two are soulmates and have some supernatural bond, it sends ridiculously harmful messages to teens everywhere. Not only is Bella reduced to wailing in such a dramatic fashion that a responsible father would probably force her to spend time with a therapist, but it gets worse than that. At the idea of never being together again, both members of this couple feel that suicide is their only hope. It’s dark and depressing, and exactly the opposite of what we should be teaching young people. I don’t have much more to say about New Moon, because not much else happens in the movie.",SHOW MORE,The Twilight Saga: New Moon,The Twilight Saga: New Moon - Movie Reviews

This movie's main issue is that its main purpose is to create a love triangle and it does little to move the plot forward. The world is explored a little more and there are some exciting moments near the end, but this movie still doesn't have enough to make it worth sitting through. The first movie was just okay but this one feels like it doesn't do much in terms of plot progression.

It's like a broken car that won't start so you have to push it. The acting isn't as horrendous as the first but it's script is still incredibly weak and shallow. The plot feels like it could have actually been tolerable but it never really reached that stage. A big issue with the first film I had was that it felt like the plot was an afterthought in exchange for shitty character interactions. This film does the same thing but Jacob and Bella's dialogue is slightly more interesting than her dialogue from the previous film. Ultimately I can say that this whole series is a big disappointment, if I remember correctly the next movies have a lot more story driven elements or maybe they don't I don't remember.

4507,Jacob B,"Jul 21, 2019","""A whole lotta nothing in between somethings"". That's the precise sentence that an article I read summed up New Moon as. Guess they were onto something. Not only is the pacing incredibly slow but all the things that the first film had bad, this movie does worse. The acting is worse, the script is worse and it's hard to take seriously. With cringy dialogue, an overlong runtime and unlikable leads. Basically the Cullens leave because Bella got a papercut on her birthday and she spends 3 months sitting on a chair sulking and apparently that's all she did in those 3 months, seeing as how she never changes clothes and nothing in the background looks any different. The few things the movie has going for it are: some decent-ish, if disappointingly brief, action scenes with some decently rendered CGI werewolves and Michael Sheen's performance. Shame he's not in a whole lot of it because God forbid we put in someone who's good at acting, regardless of film quality, and have him stay there for more than 10 minutes. We wouldn't want the other actors to be revolting now, would we? Also, why doesn't she stay with Jacob? True, I already know who she'll end up with (I haven't felt this much suspense since Katniss, Peeta and Gale) but Jacob actually does have more dimensions than sparkly Cedric Diggory ever had. And I'm not saying that because we share the same first name. If you're a Twilight fan, more power to you. But if you're not, this movie is so boring. Even if the franchise was already fairly short on action to begin with, that doesn't excuse the fact that barely anything happens of interest despite being a story about vampires and werewolves.",The Twilight Saga: New Moon,The Twilight Saga: New Moon - Movie Reviews

4513,JOHN U,"Aug 25, 2021","They had us in the first half, not going to lie. Though I was really happy with the direction this film immediately went for in creating a soft sort of post-apocalyptic world for humans and apes to get along in, I wasn't exactly sold on the approach that this film took. It was just under an hour of nobody trusting nobody, blunders being made and guns being waved and while it was certainly wrought with tension, it was the stressful, unpleasant sort of tension because both sides and all the stand out characters on both sides (except Carver, He was just an idiot) have such believable and pitiable motivations and social predicaments that the idea of conflict between them (something I knew was eventually going to come) seemed completely undesirable. With the plot moving so slowly at the beginning, it was slightly agonizing to experience. However, there was enough interesting character dynamics (Caesar and Malcom, Caesar's son's apprehensions, Koba's stirring hatred, Maurice with everyone but especially Malcom's son) and visually resplendent world building to keep the film going until Koba does the fateful deed. After that, the film blooms fully into it's singularly unique, compelling, tragic, chaotic and almost operatic identity. I think it was the only right decision the writers could have made to have the apes strike first. After the first film we have sort of been conditioned to see the humans as the enemies of the apes and what with the enormous arsenal and testy nerves of the human colony, it seemed that the oppression of the apes would soon come again. It was exactly the development the Caesar and the apes needed, a conflict, betrayal, a villain in their midst to drive home that the apes are not intrinsically better than the humans. The moment that Caesar realizes this, lying wounded in front of his son, brought low by the betrayal of his own kind and humbling himself by returning to the home he had moved on from is a powerful moment and what I think the entire film was leading up to. Caesar and Malcom both realizing the worth of the other's kind and acknowledging each other as friends. On a big picture scale, the apes trilogy is using it's second installment to level the playing field between apes and humans to set up the climax of the third act, but it does so in an explosive and poignant way. I think the flavor that this film has that most science fiction action films do not is a feeling of tragedy. Not tragedy in the sense of failure, but in the conflict and mistrust between and within the apes and humans that inevitably will lead to great strife. This film has action, drama and heart but each of these is given a vein of tragedy. Thankfully, it is the kind that is epic even in it's laments and drives some hard hitting questions home as the apes become smarter and stronger. Heck, not only do they talk a lot more, by the end they were speaking in metaphor while beating the snot out of each other. It may sound odd, but that kind of thing is what I think the apes movies are made for. Another significant advancement… have I mentioned that this movie is very good as a sequel? Paying homage, carrying themes over from the first installment while giving the narrative further believable direction and a wider focus? Well now I've mentioned it, and the greatest thing about it is the increased inclusion of the best character in the series: Maurice. Maurice already has the advantage of being an orangutan which is makes him cuddly and imposing at the same time, but he also gets the singular honor of being the good friend to the main characters and since not as much attention is given him, he is not tarnished by a lesson needing to be learned or a flaw to correct. He's just pure awesome. When he turns his piercing eyes toward Malcom's family and utters his one word in the film ""run"" I got chills. He's just a peaceful, understanding presence and he's the only one who gets along with both sides (something I wished could've happened for everyone) and when he had to, he grabbed that ape and showed him who's boss. I love that kind of character. I was genuinely concerned when he got shot but was relieved to see that he just shook it off like the bad-A he is.

The middle film in his trilogy sees the imperious Andy Serkis reprising his role as Caesar in a post-apocalyptic world, where most of the human race has been wiped out by Simian flu (yes, it's more topical than it was on its release date). Caesar clashes with fellow ape Koba over the way in which to approach the human race leading to a split amongst the colony, and resulting in civil dispute. Weta digital's visual work is nothing short of remarkable, and the communication between the apes is staggeringly realistic. Serkis is the star, as he his throughout the franchise (utter shame on Oscar for not recognising his work) and the way the physical performances of Serkis and co combine with the special effects to give you a world in which you truly believe everything is real, deserves the highest of praise.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes - Movie Reviews

There was some deterioration for me that big critics didn't see, namely that the dialogue between the apes seemed intended to be rudimentary but was in reality just very poorly written. They didn't seem to gesticulate enough to convey the emotion the lines were meant to have and so the subtitles just didn't match up for me. I think they improved the CGI on the apes but did so at the cost of doing rather poorly on the herd of deer and the bear in the opening scenes. I loved the heel turn of Caesar's lieutenant, the overall plot and the film score, which was top notch. This entire series seems set to grow in critical acclaim as the years go by.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes - Movie Reviews
4539,Akshat M,"Oct 16, 2020","I am big fan of Rise of the Planet of the Apes, it was with some anticipation that I awaited this latest instalment. Maybe I had my expectations too high, or maybe the film is just missing that something special, movie was not upto the mark. The acting was okay except Ceaser's (whose acting was great). The plot was good but little bit stretched. The pacing was also problem but not a big one. Overall, you will enjoy the movie but it has some limitations.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes - Movie Reviews

4541,Alef M,"Aug 29, 2020","""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" mantém a essência do primeiro, mas não só isso, explora as possibilidades reais do acontecido e as evolui de uma maneira incrível. Toda a semelhança entre os primatas e os humanos é muito bem explorada aqui. Seja em relação a cultura, método de caça, respeito, medo, conceito de família etc. Uma ótima sacada do roteiro foi situar uma realidade onde os primatas estão em constante evolução, já os humanos em declínio. Eles nem se quer tem energia elétrica, um dos pilares mais básicos. A evolução do personagem ""César"" é brilhante. No inicio da obra, o mesmo acreditava que era melhor que os humanos, já no final seu pensamento mudara. Ele percebera que os mesmos eram muito mais parecidos com os humanos do que ele desejara. O filme deixa claro que os humanos foram inconsequentes desde o principio. Além de criar um vírus, conseguiram a proeza de criar uma nova vida inteligente. Mas o que mais me chamou atenção foi quais sentimentos o protagonista e antagonista aprenderam dos humanos. César aprendeu a amar, pois já esteve com um humano verdadeiramente bom, que lhe deu um lá e o acolheu. Koba foi um objeto de estudo e sofreu a sua vida toda, logo aprendeu a odiar. O mesmo já tinha um espirito antagônico desde o primeiro longa, e sua evolução ate´aqui é satisfatória nesse sentido. A cinematografia desse filme chega a ser poética em diversos planos, rendendo ótimas fotografias ricas em conteúdos sub-contextuais. A ost também esteve bem presente e a mixagem de som foi muito bem feita. A direção de arte no que se diz respeito aos primatas e a cidade também está de parabéns. Não posso deixar de mencionar a voz de César, que tem um peso ABSURDO. A voz de Koba também é muito marcante, e inclusive, a diferença no tom e tonalidade cria um contraste muito interessante entre os macacos.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes - Movie Reviews

4549,Matchell C,"Nov 07, 2021","'Transformers' is a movie that I hold dearly to my heart. I watched it over and over on loop almost every day as a kid, I was hooked. I loved it because the action was cool, the main character was my idle, and the robot cast had cool designs. But how does this movie hold up, now that I'm a little older? (surprisingly well actually). The movie follows Sam, a young man who has bought his very first car. But little does he know, that this car is an alien from the planet cybertron. The aliens have come down to earth, in order to obtain a powerful item, the allspark, a relic that can give life to machine, and repair the robots home planet. There are two factions fighting for it, the autobots (good guys) and the decepticons (bad guys). On the one side, the autobots believe in the right for all life forms, while the decepticons only care about power. The film also follows William Lenox, a soldier that was attacked by a decepticon, and now has to fight for survival. The movie ALSO also follows this Australian hacker that provides a bit of plot progression, and that's it. The plot is pretty cool, and the way that the movie focuses on multiple characters is neat, but how do the characters play out? Sam is quite charming, due to his interactions with characters being oddly comical, in a certain type of way, and is probably relatable to a lot of guys. His love interest however is incredibly dull. Mikaela is nothing but a love interest, she has no personality, and she just willingly does what the characters tell her to do. William and his team of soldiers were funny, they had a few memorable one liners, and William has a nice motive and a cool action moment towards the climax. As stated before, Australian girl is just there for plot, but her friend, Glen, is incredibly funny (also some great one liners from him). Other characters such as Sam's parents are very interesting characters, Simmons is again another funny character, and that's about it for the human characters. The Transformers themselves (character wise) are really lame in comparison. All five autobots have personalities, but you don't get to see them that often, as they: A. don't appear that often. B. usually fighting most of the time. C. have dialogue that is strait and one dimensional, especially Optimus's. There is also a moment in the film were one of the robots, Bumblebee, is captured, and it's played as an emotional moment. However, you don't feel anything because you barely even know the bot because the movie never gave Bee enough room to show his character. Megatron and his decepticons are very intimidating, but they have little personality, outside of being big baddies. The reason why a lot of people don't like the film is because of the focus on the humans, and not the Transformers. Personally, i'm 'okay' with it, but I don't think it's something that would completely ruin the movie. As of the action scenes, they are awesome. Watching the bots beating each other up is very amusing, and is only helped by the wonderful CGI, that still holds up to today. The Transformers all have a certain shade and glossiness that makes them fit into the backgrounds. Their transformations are incredibly satisfying, with all the funky sound effects and moving parts. The overall designs of the Transformers had people divided, but these are the ones that me and a lot of other kids grew up with, and they're all just as good as the original designs. In conclusion, 'Transformers' (despite not being that much about them) is a really good movie, thanks to its funny/memorable human cast, awesome action scenes, and CGI that still holds up to this date, highly recommend.",Transformers,Transformers - Movie Reviews

4554,Purple S,"Sep 07, 2021","I had high hopes for the first transformers movie, it seemed to be the only decent one besides bumblebee based on the reviews. But Michael Bay's need for out of place awkward and strange banter seep in to the film and make you feel uncomfortable at times. There were no proper payoffs, certain things were mentioned and not seen again. It didn't have a lot of why I like transformers, distinct character personalities that are complex and fun. It had some interesting observations about human beings, and I'll admit it was cool seeing the live action iterations of different autobots. But Transformers was a disappointment.",Transformers,Transformers - Movie Reviews

4556,Puroo R,"Aug 18, 2021","As a kid I didn't know that Transformers is a set of toys. I only used to think that it is an anime series. The first time I learnt about the movies was when one of my friends got a Nexus tablet to school and played this movie when there was no teacher in the class. I really liked the opening scenes and decided that at some point I will watch this movie. Little did I know that the opportunity will come 8 years later when the lockdown would happen. I watched it and enjoyed it very much. Transformers is exactly what I wanted to watch when I used to see the terrible anime. I didn't like Optimus Prime very much back then but in this movie I understood why he is so important to the franchise and now I am a huge fan of Optimus Prime. There were so many other Transformers whose names I got to learn as I watched this full staff I used to see this movie in parts on TV and I used to think that Bumblebee was Hotshot. After watching this movie I was feeling like replacing the the logo of my car with the Transformers logo. All the Transformers movies have very good CGI, cinematography, choreography and colour grading. What the other movies lack in, however, is a good story and acting. This movie has all of that. I really wish all the other Transformers movies were also like this. Here I cared about Sam, the army guys and of course, Mikaela (°""U""°). This is one of the only two Transformers movies which actually has a good plot (the other doing bumblebee). If the future Transformers movies had built up on what this movie created they could have actually been very awesome. But instead they focused more on creating a bigger universe with more cars and more merch to sell rather than on character development. I can often come back to watch this movie because of the cool cars and fight scenes, without having any of the cringe the future movies had.",Transformers,Transformers - Movie Reviews

4558,Anaadi G,"Aug 03, 2021","This film is a true gem that is sometimes neglected owing to its numerous sequels. Unlike the following several, this one has legendary humor. Along with the 1986 film, this is an outstanding masterpiece. Unlike some of the subsequent films, this one features some well-written human characters that are both interesting and entertaining. The photography is superb and the film appears to be really stylish. The narrative revolves on a teenage boy and his car works surprisingly well and feels like many of the more classic Steven Spielberg films such as Jurassic Park or E.T. The dialogue is really good and Glen is very relatable. I think that the way they portray the Decepticons in this movie as absolute hulking unstoppable beasts that you need to work together to defeat was really cool. The designs for the transformers are menacing and aesthetically pleasing. All in all there's a lot more than meets the eye to this film!",Transformers,Transformers - Movie Reviews

The scene with all of the Ford vehicles driving through a winding mountain path was indiscernible from a Ford commercial, and it was planned that way.

4567,Jacob R,"Jun 07, 2021","This is just another example for style over substance for me, which is more then what I can say for the rest of these terrible movies (excluding Bumblebee of course). The action isn't that bad (despite having too many explosions for my taste), the story isn't as bad as I remember (which isn't saying a lot), and the actual robots can still be fun to watch (which would be the only reasons I would watch the sequels, Bumblebee being a stand-out). Where this movie loses all the points for a good movie is all the humans. OMG are they stupid af. Shia Lebouf is the only one that I actually liked, and if that's the case, you know they're bad (pre ""Peanut Butter Falcon"" Shia, let's not forget). Yeah, Megan Fox and Anthony Anderson are very annoying, especially Anderson, who is just yelling a lot. Fox isn't as bad, but she just there for eye candy for the pubescent boys watching. Wow, I didn't think I would have that much to talk about with this one. Just...try to drive as far away from this one as possible.",Transformers,Transformers - Movie Reviews
