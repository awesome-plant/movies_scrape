0,Ben W,6h ago,The best movie of all time,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
1,Aidan B,3d ago,"It provides groundbreaking CGI and is a well-acted film, however, the extremely generic story and mediocre plot end up bogging this film down. I think Cameron does a good job in directing this film, and the idea and worldbuilding was very well, however, the execution is poor as it just feels way more generic than it should have been. The acting is well though, and the CGI is phenomenal. There were also several plot holes, though I do hold hope that the planned sequel does expand well upon this film and better explains a lot of the things that occur. Overall, an entertaining film, just not one of Cameron's best works due to its lacking story.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
2,Rob T,"Nov 11, 2021","I didn't watch this in 3D but I did watch this on a big screen (not some 65"" TV) so I admit the visuals are quality but I'm guessing the 3D adds a lot more to the visuals. The story itself is unique, though there are some occasional scratch-your-head moments. I may be in the minority but it felt a bit weird to root for the romantic inter-species relationship. Still, overall a fairly decent piece of entertainment.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
3,Jon S,"Nov 10, 2021","Spectacular 3D visuals. Everything else (plot, character, dialogue, acting, pacing) was middling to bad.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
4,Michael P,"Oct 24, 2021","Unfortunately, this movie just hasn't aged well over the years. While the visuals are stunning (Pandora's flora and fauna) where built really well, great lighting, great photography work and the human portion of the dialogue isn't bad either, I just can't get past two big things in this movie a) the dialogue of the Na'vi - I mean, that is the best they could come up with? and b) the story arc - the movie is basically a mashup of Dances w/ Wolves, FernGully, and Pocahontas. Sure it isn't a complete 1 for 1, but for someone who had a lot of time to work on the story line, this is the best James C could come up with? (Dances w/ Wolves in Outer Space?) The technological concepts are good, but the story overtime, it just gets worse everytime I watch it. I cringe when I hear the Na'vi rally cry, its just culturally...well, insensitive. In this regard, the Na'vi language isn't original...of course, its a unique language completely made up (Frommer took inspiration from the Maori language)....and I guess that is my problem here. The vocal range is human, the language is based off a human language, the pitch and frequency of the spoken language is human. It just doesn't make a lot of sense...think about it, we share 98.8% of our DNA with chimpanzees, 70% of our DNA with zebrafish, and 60% of our DNA with bananas, and we sound NOTHING ALIKE! ;-) We travel to another fictional part of the universe and the Na'vi just happen to sound like one of our Polynesian languages hear on earth? If they are in the process of are being unoriginal, they could have at least given the Na'vi a proper Haka War Cry.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
5,Shane B,"Oct 20, 2021","When you take away the CGI and 3D effects, the movie itself isn't great. Go to a planetarium, you'll save some time. Dud!",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
6,Andrew M,"Oct 08, 2021","The world of Avatar is absolutely stunning. The visuals are remarkable, The Na'vi culture is very rich and Zoe Saldana does an amazing job in this film. A lot of hard work was put into this movie and it shows.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
7,Robb D,"Sep 09, 2021","What Avatar lacks in originality, it easily makes up for with stunning visuals and some amazing action. Cameron is a genius with a camera and his mastery is on full display to anyone who can view this beautiful film in the best HD resolution possible. 9/10",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
8,Eric P,"Aug 28, 2021",Here is a film that is truly amazing! The visual effects in this were one of a kind that were special and effective. The music and the scenes in Avatar gave me emotional feelings where I almost teared up. The action sequences in this film are amazing as well. One could argue that this movie is just Dances with Wolves knock-off with a hint of science fiction but the positives outweigh the negatives. James Cameron did a very phenomenal job directing this film.,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
9,Jordan H,"Aug 24, 2021",Cookie cutter plot. Saw it for the novelty of new 3D in 2009. No need to ever watch it again.,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews

16,Robert P,"Jul 23, 2021","The most expensive film to make, and currently it holds the biggest gross returns in history, I can only say this is the ultimate sci-fi adventure you can see to date!",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
17,"Jul 18, 2021","Probably the best Disney movie I've ever seen, ahead of it's time, watched it in theaters back then with 3d glasses and it blew any 3d movie out the water",FLAG THIS REVIEW,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
18,Dean S,"Jul 17, 2021",Saw in the movies in 3D so that was fun. But the story itself was pretty cheesy. I'm glad James Cameron stopped this nonsense and is now focusing on the epic story of Alita the Battle Angel.,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
19,Joe D,"Jul 11, 2021","To me this is the most perfect blockbuster of all. Love Sam Worthington's empty cup, I find his everyman acting compelling, Saldana may be the most beautiful woman on the planet with her trademark perfect posture, and Sigourney adds class with extra to spare wherever she goes. The planet Pandora remains the real star, and the revelation that we're the bad guys and the spiritual tree-huggers were right all along, I find genuinely touching every time. First class and I can't wait for more of Cameron's magic touch.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
20,Jimmy W,"Jul 10, 2021","The fact that this movie can make the most money of all time and also gain a following of hive-minded morons to defend it says more about the state of society than it does the movie itself. For a movie that's meant to make a point about abusive use of the environment, they sure seem to indulge in the use of massive amounts of expensive technology that no doubt utilized way more than its fair share of natural resources. Oh well, at least you can pretend to be vindicated by the box office numbers.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
21,Goudkuil E,"Jun 29, 2021","Apart from the visuals everything feels uninspired and thrown together using a old cliche of an outsider seeing what's wrong with what he's people have been doing falling in love then whiching sides. The acting is ok, the dialogue is kinda rough. The movie is padded with a lot of nice scenique views with no real narrative meaning.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
22,Antonio D,"Jun 15, 2021","o filme possui uma fotografia muito bela e, mesmo o filme sendo de 2009 não conseguimos encontrar defeitos em relação a montagem e fotografia, a história é satisfatória e é um reflexo do que sabemos que aconteceu no inicio da colonização",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
23,Tyler W,"Jun 11, 2021","The visuals were revolutionary for the time. But story matters and to the extent this film had a plot, it was borrowed from FernGully and Dances with Wolves.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
24,Noah H,"Jun 08, 2021","Great film through and through. The plot is excellent and engaging, and the character development is of a very high standard. Although it is a very long film, every scene adds to the atmosphere. Definitely worth watching - you won't regret it!",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
25,Erick F,"May 28, 2021","Filme perfeito. Edição, imagens, efeitos, narrativa, roteiro, atuações, planos de sequências. Incrivelmente extraordinário, te transporta para a incrível realidade de Pandora, e faz você de lá nunca mais querer voltar. Película completamente por múltiplas razões.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
26,Nathan t,"May 28, 2021","Avatar is an American science fiction film, directed by James Cameron and released in 2009. In this film we can find many guess like Sam Worthington or Sigourney Weaver. They portray Jake Sully and Dr. Grace Augustine. The main character Jake Sully try to understand how does a new specie live in Pandora. The film is about the probably future of humanity. The humans have deleted all the ressources of the earth, so they try to visit others planets for maybe find minerals. During this film we are on Pandora, a moon of a new planet. Human species can live in the Pandora's atmosphere, but scientist found a possibility to go discover all the planet. Take control of humanoids who live in Pandora. So we follow Jake Sully and Dr. Grace Augustin who will try to make contact with Eywa the chief of this new population. When I watched this movie for the first time the plot convinced me, because it is unpredictable and highly absorbing. There are many unexpected during all the movie. I must talk to you about the special effects. This movie is, for me, the most staggering film of the last 10 years. All jungle and humanoids made with special effects, the colors and the mood are very special. Each flowers or trees are detailed. It is perfectly stunning. The photography also is breathtaking, colors enable to convince all the viewers. There different cinematography techniques which give a beautiful introduction and transitions during the movie. Actors, portrayed, a human character but also a humanoid character, they must keep the same attitude and the same mouvements when they represented creatures. Each actor is natural and it's likeable to see. To sum up, I can say that this movie must be watch by everybody. With all work to make the special effects and the script, this movie seem prefect.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
27,Jasper S,"May 27, 2021","De wereld van avatar roept bij mij vooral emoties van verwondering op. De wereld is zo wonder schoon en goed uitgewerkt. Je kan de hele film 2 keer kijken 1 keer voor de film zelf en de tweede keer voor de visuals. Het best voor deze film is om hem in de bioscoop te bekijken. Daar in die donkere bioscoop waar niks uitmaakt behalve de film worden bijna alle zintuigen geprikkeld. De dolby atmos surround sound zorgt ervoor dat jou oren alles meekrijgen wat er om jou heen gebeurt. Van het kogelschot rechts voor naar het fluitende vogeltje links achter. Het grote doek zorgt ervoor data jou hele gezicht veld word opgenomen door deze adem benemende film. Je voelt misschien niks fysiek op je huid neerkomen maar als jij kippenvel krijgt van de film merk jij dat heus. Het jammere is dat je de film niet kan ruiken of proeven wat zou dat een beleving zijn. Dan zou er bijna geen verschil meer zitten tussen film en realiteit. Deze wereld bevind zich in het universum met de aarde. De wereld zelf bevind zich echter op een andere planeet binnen dit universum. De wereld lijkt erg op de aarde met het aantal gewassen die overal staan alleen is alles een stuk groter. James Cameron is de regisseur en schrijver van de film. Dus de wereld is in zijn hoofd gemaakt. De mensen die de wereld daadwerkelijk gemaakt hebben zoals jij het in de bioscoop mag zien is gemaakt door een groep van meer dan 1000 mensen een gigantische computer server en een groot budget. Filmen begon in april 2007. Dat betekent natuurlijk niet dat deze film toen al af was want hij was pas in december 2009 te zien in de bioscopen. Avatar is een box office film gedirigeerd en geschreven door James Cameron die zich afspeelt op een andere planeet. De boodschap van avatar is dat je zuinig moet zijn op je grondstoffen. En je zuinig moet zijn op de planeet waarop je woont. De doelgroep van Avatar is iedereen die van films houd vooral van een beetje science fiction. Er zit niet perse een leeftijd grens aan de film je moet alleen wel 13 zijn om de film te kunnen zien. Het verhaal van de wereld is dat de aarde niet meer goed bewoonbaar is en de mensen van de aarde naar een andere planeet gaan om daar grondstoffen te verkrijgen om rijk te worden. De hoofdrolspeler is een man die geen functionaliteit meer heeft in zijn benen en naar de planeet komt voor onderzoek. Hij gaat zichzelf over zetten in een lichaam van de inboorlingen waarin hij ook weer kan lopen. Het conflict van het verhaal is tussen mens/machine en inboorling/natuur. De inboorlingen houden namelijk van hun wereld en behandelen de wereld met de respect dat die nodig heeft en de mensen komen alles kapot maken. De hoofdrol speler zorgt ervoor dat er een connectie gelegd word tussen mens en inboorling maar stapt uiteindelijk over naar de kant van de inboorlingen om hun te helpen mens te verslaan. De characters Bestaan uit mensen, mensen in machines, Na'vi (inboorling), en meerdere dieren. In de wereld waar de mensen komen is alles een stuk groter dus de mensen maken exoskeletons om een kans te hebben. De Na'vi aan de andere kant zijn zo in toon met de natuur dat is een vlecht hebben waarmee ze een band kunnen maken met dieren. De sferen die in het verhaal komen zijn heel wissel valig door de film heen. In het begin is het vooral leuk dat je alles kan ontdekken en sta je achter de mensen. Als de hoofdpersoon met zijn lichaam van een na'vi het kamp van de na'vi binnen komt is er vooral liefde. Daarna sta je achter de na'vi en is er vooral verdriet over de destructie van de mensen. Maar op het eind is het euforie door de overwinning van de na'vi. Een hele achtbaan aan sferen dus De film word foto realistisch vorm gegeven op een 2d doek. Ook 3d als je de bioscoop extra betaald en je een bril opdoet. Het thema van de wereld is natuur en duurzaamheid.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews

36,"Apr 27, 2021","The main film of the year 2009 is «Avatar» by James Cameron, the producer of such films as «Terminator», «Titanic», «The Strangers». This film ranks with above-mentioned world-famous films and probably belongs to the science-fiction genre. The action of the film is set on the planet Pandora in the year of 3000. The plot is rather simple: the super hero Avatar is to save the alien planet and to fulfill this mission he struggles with a lot of difficulties. The main character, Jack Sally, is a disabled navy who has just come back from the war. The film starts with the scene when he is invited to take part in a secret expedition to the planet, inhabited by weird creatures. Thus, he becomes the part of the programme called Avatar. Being turned into a a three-metre giant with blue skin, he is sent to the planet with the help of special «drivers» that link his mind to the mind of Avatar. What impressed me most is the spectacular world of aliens that we, the audience, see through the eyes of the main character. The special effects and 3D technologies enhance the impression of the bright and colourful world in contrast to the human one, which is grey and dying. The plot of the film is fast-moving with some amusing episodes. For those who are indifferent to the computer graphics, there is another storyline that is love of «the dream worker» to a beautiful female alien, who, being hostile and suspicious at first, falls in love with him. Such love is forbidden and as a result the pair is chased by the aliens. Happily, they managed to escape in the end. To my mind, the brillant acting of Sam Worthingdon, who is starring in the film, is above all expectations. To sum up, I can say that the film «Avatar» is that kind of film that takes us to a special world beyond imagination. More than that, it is the film that you want to watch over and over again. Definitely, the new film by Cameron couldn't be missed.",SHOW MORE,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews

This is one movie that Just HAD to be seen in 3D! Loved it! Great action, special effects and a powerful story. The story has similarities from both Fern Gully and Dances with Wolves. I was blown away!! James Cameron did a great Job of creating this new world of Pandora and the Navi and the Beautiful creatures of this world. The cast such as leads Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana also did a tremendous job!

It's what I expected to see, after they've invested over $ 350 million doing it. And it's definitely what I was hoping to see to dramatically close a franchise that, in my opinion, should take a break so as not to saturate the genre.

59,Alex T,"Nov 16, 2021","I've always liked Marvel comics and followed the movies somewhat as a result, never really following the MCU, but due to movies like Endgame I feel like I'm really falling out with the fanbase. My view of Endgame is its just overrated beyond belief, I think the premise is okay in the sense that it ties all the previous movies up and includes many of the characters but its bad in the way in how destructive it is, disabling any kind of meaningful progression in the franchise. I feel in this way, the deaths in this film and the one before it are hollow where they have little meaning due to them being resurrected in a spinoff or in canon. Admittedly the special effects are impressive and the sheer scope of the movie is as well but is undermined by a destructive and substance-less story in addition to the its copious runtime. I'm sorry Marvel, you've lost me on this one.",Avengers: Endgame,Avengers: Endgame - Movie Reviews
60,Aidan B,"Nov 16, 2021","A fine film that, in my eyes, feels very overrated. The comedy feels more forced, the story is just constant fan-service, and the final fight scene feels more cringe than epic due to the goofiness of some of the choices they made (ie all the Avengers running in a line). While the beginning and ending was admittedly great, and the acting is still as good as ever, ""Avengers: Endgame"" just fails to hold a light to some of the far better installments in the MCU. While I still found the film to be mostly enjoyable, I was able to find enough glaring flaws during my rewatch to bring the score down.",Avengers: Endgame,Avengers: Endgame - Movie Reviews
61,Vito N,"Nov 15, 2021","After much thought I have come to the conclusion that this is my Favorite Movie of All Time. It's 3 hours long, and it's all worth it. There's so much to talk about this film whether it's the drama between Cap and his final fight, Tony and coming to peace with his father, or Thor realizing that it's him that makes the lighting and not the lightning that makes him. The action is the best it's ever been, the CGI is world class as always, and the performances from the entire ensemble cast is as good as it'll ever be. Is it a perfect film? Heck no, but it's as close to perfect as you could ever get, and it comes pretty damn close.

This classic movie has revolutionary CGI for its time, with the classic story of star-crossed-lovers transitioned to the Titanic perfectly, this film remains one of Cameron's best works ever put on the big screen.

85,Money G,"Nov 09, 2021","CMON! I was expecting more from the characters. I grew up in America and this is a movie commonly referenced in conversation. Sadly, it is a reflection of American taste and depth more than it is a beautiful movie. James Cameron extends greater consideration towards budget, set design, a panning camera, and scope of grandeur and disaster than what I identify as the real conflict worth tears. Not one person survived with a Third Class ticket. The rich negotiate, offer leverage, hide in spacious lifeboats and Rose survives instead of Jack. This is an accurate story but should be received as a tragedy instead of a romance. What lines of memorable dialogue are there? They pass the plot along, the ship must sink. There are memorable visuals, the set is magnificent, and the scene where voices stop and are frozen is excellent. However, unlike the iceberg, there is not enough depth.",Titanic,Titanic - Movie Reviews

100,Romina R,"Aug 30, 2021","There is a trend happening more now than ever where people hate on classic films for the sake of hating because they are classic films and loved by the majority of the public. As I start this ""Re-watching and Re-visiting films"" series, I will be repeating this many times. I do not quite get people's issue and ""beef"" (to put it less sophisticated) with Titanic. Is it one of the best movies of all time? Not quite. Is it a really well-done film that stays in our minds years and years after seeing it for the first time and if it is playing on a TV channel, you put it on? Why, yes. I understand the bother with a ""pointless"" love story plot line for dramatization but what's funny is that it works with the strong performances and magical chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet. But what I want to focus on in Titanic is the little scenes. There are many scenes where the tears uncontrollably fall down your face. Towards more the last section of the film where the boat officially sunk down, there is a shot from sky above of all the passengers screaming and flapping around the water. Up close, it is suffocating hysteria and from afar, it is just one sound in the middle of the gigantic ocean. People being left to die (as there are themes being shown of the lower class being purposely cast aside and the rich prioritized) and people coming to terms this might be their last breath on earth. Playing with camera angles intensifies a small scene for a viewer and makes that small scene stand out in a 3 hour movie.",Titanic,Titanic - Movie Reviews
101,JOHN U,"Aug 29, 2021","Shmaltzy, overly long, ridiculously well crafted and disarmingly heartfelt this movie is just larger than life. I think it's pacing problems are best summed up by the very first scene where Bill Paxton's character essentially does the same gag twice with the exact same reaction from his crewmember. Everything that is done in the present day in this film is essentially useless and definitely provides the most unnecessary though not the only element that makes this movie as grandiose as it is. I was ok with it all, but it made the film seem redundant in a lot of places. Do the present-day scenes add to the film? Yes, but only incidentally, it does put us in the frame of mind of the impending tragedy in a very delicate way and makes for a very meaningful and lovely ending scene but all of that was accomplishable in much less time-consuming ways. After all, the love story is the heart of the film, it would have been perfectly acceptable to keep it to just that. What happens on the Titanic is what really sets this movie apart. At it's core this is a romance and that's what gives the wide appeal of the film but in general terms, this is an absolute masterclass (and I can't stress that enough) in disaster film. I got the feeling that that was what drew James Cameron to the Titanic as a potential film, the slow sinking of such a lavish set piece, the impending and ever nearing doom as the water chases after our heroes as they struggle to survive. It is in the disaster elements (and in the glorious shots of the Titanic before that) that the film is entirely justified in it's longevity. The scale of such a disaster demands a film of such scale and Cameron was certainly the filmmaker, perhaps the only filmmaker, who was truly up to the challenge of giving the Titanic justice. So in terms of destruction, this movie absolutely floored me not even mentioning the staggeringly large scale and lavish set design. The scenes in the engine room particularly gave off a visceral sense of largeness and power that was awesome to behold even on my computer screen and the shots of the Titanic's propellers rearing from the water literally took my breath away. Its like this movie's sets are beefy. That's the word that came to me while watching it, I don't know why but that's what I thought. Of course, no amount of excellent cinematography, special effects, set design, music or sound editing will make a complete film and since we all know the story, a genuine personal touch was necessary for this movie to really excel. Well, I won't call it genuine per se but I will call it just as larger than life than the ship it took place on. I don't think it's a secret to anyone just how melodramatic this movie's nuclear romance between poor artist Jack and unsatisfied rich girl Rose is. I suppose it's also cliché to a point but I didn't really mind (it helped soften the cliches when James Horner's score just leans into the schmaltz with full force) I think the film does a good enough job with building up it's emotional center and it sprinkles in enough universally pitiable scenarios (the musicians, the babies, the families) to make it personally devastating as the long, slow burn of the Titanic's destruction unfolds in all of it's glory. The story didn't really hold any long-lasting meaning, but I don't mind that either, it was just a story aiming to be a crowd pleaser and a white knuckler at the same time, and it succeeded really well at both. I liked the whole ""jump together"" motif. Somehow, I didn't see its payoff coming and old Rose throwing the heart of the ocean into the sea really spoke some volumes about something… I don't know, it was emotionally resonant at the time. Came for the destruction, stayed with the romance long enough to actually get to the destruction and enjoyed the sweet, admittedly pretentious ending.",Titanic,Titanic - Movie Reviews

James Cameron achieved something remarkable in Titanic, with his relentless attention to detail, perfect direction and clever use of every trick in the special effects book to take the viewer aboard the great ship as she set sail in April, 1912. The underlying Romeo and Juliet love story of the film's two central characters, Jack and Rose, is engaging and bought to life by the perfectly cast Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet, who have just enough chemistry to make you care about their love story. A fantastic supporting cast of quality actors, perfectly cast, helps to bring this modern remake of A Night To Remember to life. You realise you have completely bought into the movie when you feel utter dread during the sinking scenes. Definitely one of the all-time greatest movies ever made.

The set is magnificent and the contrast between rich and poor as well as society expectation and free will is handled really well but the moment the ship hits the iceberg, it's near perfect. You truly feel the tension and fright as we see the effect of the sinking on so many people as well as the (let's be honest) terrible organization of the crew and the visuals hage aged super well. Hard to believe it's a 1997 movie. And gosh that last half made me cry, seeing the hopelessness of many of the victims and of course, Jack's death. I'm still pissed that Jack died but that bastard Cal survived. But still, incredible. It's definitely slow at times.

It is still just the third highest grossing film ever (however part of that comes from the 3-D rerelease) and still is quoted and talked about constantly to this day. Now is it a perfect movie, no. Is it overrated, absolutely. But there is still such a great nature to it that makes it honestly hard not to love (at least slightly). The first 90 minutes of the movie is essentially just a chick flick (and the writing is not the best) but it has such a charm to it and Leo and Kate’s chemistry is so likable that you can’t help but enjoy it (even if it isn’t the best). Then the rest becomes a completely different movie almost, as we see the titanic sink. This is where the movie really becomes phenomenal. The effects done and the cinematography and shots we get are great. Even though I’ve never really liked James Cameron much as a person you deny that he is a great director, especially with action scenes like the end to the movie. The entire last half of this movie is completely thrilling to watch and also it is heartbreaking when (spoiler alert) Jack dies (but you probably already knew that).

127,Aidan B,"Nov 20, 2021","""The Force Awakens"" opens this new ""Star Wars"" trilogy to an entertaining start, with groundbreaking CGI and action sequences, this film is easily the best in the whole trilogy. The new characters and places introduced are not entirely fresh or memorable, though they fit well into the story. Speaking of the story, I thought that this film was heading in a very interesting direction by making Finn, a stormtrooper that betrays the First Order, learn the ways of the Force. I also liked the character Rey, though I don't think that she should've been the main focus of the film. Kylo Ren is a very well done and emotional character though, and his connection to Darth Vader adds all the more depth to his character. Where I think this film fails, however, is the constant fan service that is done, which isn't done in a very creative way, rather it seems more of a cheat for that extra ""Hey I recognize that"" moment. It often plays on the nostalgia of those that grew up with the previous films and uses that nostalgia to power its main story.

154,Jacob B,"Sep 16, 2021",Star Wars 7: The force awakens (A-) (90%) Movie had so much hype before it's release and j.j. Abrams did a good job with it. Really wish that there was a more cohesive story throught the rest of the trilogy which ticks it down a bit now for me. But this movie and the other movies of the trilogy work better on their own then together. This movie in specific is just a whole lot of fun. Love seeing the rise of Kylo Ren (my favorite character from the sequels) and Harrison Ford back in action. Fun watch but don't get to attached to where the plot is taking the story in the other movies.,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Movie Reviews

It has a large number of characters, and I like that each one has their moment to shine, that's a plus point. The actions of each character are completely justified, Thanos as the main antagonist is perfect, the reasons for which he acts are given and he gives more richness to the film. Anyway, you can not stay without seeing Infinity War, it is a good movie but I think it was enough for more, that if, this does not prevent you from enjoying it at all.",Avengers: Infinity War,Avengers: Infinity War - Movie Reviews

214,Jon M,"Sep 23, 2021","The word ""soulless"" covers most of my issue. The voice acting was entirely lacking heart, and in some cases was simply given poor direction. (Mufasa roars, and asks ""Is that a challenge?"" As if he's inviting Scar to tea.) John Oliver was entirely out of his depth, Ejiofor gives zero malice to the role, Beyonce over-sings every line, and Seth Rogen's perfectly played irreverence stands as the one bright spot.

215,Jayden D,"Sep 22, 2021","I have NOT been a fan of the rehashed remakes that Disney have put out as of late (Beauty & The Beast, Aladdin, Mulan...UGH...,Lady & The Tramp...not bad but mediocre) though I have 2 exceptions, The Jungle Book and this latest rendition of The Lion King. To be real, there's never gonna be a Lion King rendition that's gonna come anywhere close to the 1994 classic, let's be honest with ourselves. However for it's credit, this remake did not want to make me leave the theater in disgust. If anything it's a good movie that it's worth a watch, you just gotta dial down your expectations of the movie because some parts of it are kinda watered down and a bit of filler moments are put in there too which would explain this movie being 25 minutes longer than the original. Other than that, it does follow the script to the letter and makes for a good nostalgia high with modernized graphics. Props to the CGI team, this movie does look beautiful, probably the highest mark of the movie. It's not a bad Disney movie at all, the unfortunate part is that it does not surpass what the animated classic has already brought out to us and those are shoes that are almost impossible to fill so I can understand this movie falling short in some parts. It does make for a good comparison of what is being brought to this generation versus what my generation got as a kid growing up in the 90's.",The Lion King,The Lion King - Movie Reviews

It feels less like a remake or re-imagining than a remaster - viewers who want a new spin on a classic will be disappointed to find they are paying to see a movie they've already seen (albeit with a new coat of paint). While it's a shame that director/producer Jon Favreau added nothing new to this tale (despite proving his capabilities with 2016's vivid and fresh 'The Jungle Book') it manages to retain the soul of the original and is sufficiently entertaining. Excellent voice and vocal performances couple with stunningly life-like depictions of wild Africa and it's animal inhabitants to satisfy fans hoping to relive an old favorite, while offering new viewers an experience approximate to what the rest of us experienced in 1994, albeit with less facially emotive animals.",The Lion King,The Lion King - Movie Reviews

269,Michael S,"Dec 23, 2018","As any hardcore fan of the TV series knows, no actress was ever going to be able to fill the tights of icons like Honor Blackman and Diana Rigg. The producers should have known such fans would provide not an instant audience but an army of instant deplorers many of whom notoriously refused to even see the movie. What idiot producer then provides not just one unacceptable Uma, but adds a second unacceptable Uma in the bargain (Uma's dual role as both Emma Peel and nemesis)? Poor Uma never stood a chance, given she is a notoriously verveless actress especially compared to Diana Rigg. Uma turned out to be much more suited to originating roles that she was capable of playing (see Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill). As bad an idea as casting Thurman (or anyone in a film that shouldn't have been made), there was a great idea in casting Connery as the Bondian villain and this was the only potential drawing power the film really had (it was the only reason I went to see it!). Connery appears to be having the time of his life portraying the essence of maniacal glee. The script is awful, even if the science is not gibberish it's delivered at such breakneck speed it comes off as such. The actors spout dialogue at each other to zero reaction, like each one is occupying a separate room. Fiennes is credible in the action scenes, but otherwise is so bland as to blend into the wallpaper. If Patrick MacNee had feared being outdone in the role, they turned out to be groundless. If you actually need a reason to watch this, there are a few good moments reminiscent of Peel-era idiosyncratic oddball Avengers style moments, such as the Spectre-like villains meeting at a round table disguised as different colored teddy bears.",The Avengers,The Avengers - Movie Reviews

The two head off to the Ministry to meet Mother (Jim Broadbent), who informs them the Prospero project - an attempt to influence the weather - was sabotaged apparently by Emma Peel. Dr. Peel claims she is innocent, but she is sent to work alongside Steed to find the real culprit. Mother's off-sider, Father (Fiona Shaw), claims Peel suffers from a mental disease. They go off to visit Sir August De Wynter (Sean Connery), an old ally of The Ministry. He takes an instant liking to Peel, as they both share a love of weather. Steed and Emma follow a lead to Wonderland Weather - a business that artificially creates heat or rain with a special machine - where they discover two dead men in teddy bear suits. The members of a secret organisation - led by De Wynter - all wear teddy bear suits to disguise their identities. One of them, however, looks exactly like Emma Peel. Steed arrives in time to save Peel, as the double jumps off a roof and disappears. Steed and Emma go off to visit De Wynter at his mansion but are attacked by mechanical bees. Alice (Eileen Atkins), a Ministry agent, helps them to flee; nevertheless, De Wynter captures Emma who then tries to escape but finds herself trapped due to the mansion's ever-changing floor plan. She smashes her way through a window, and Steed rescues her. Back at Steed's apartment, however, Peel is arrested by Father, as Steed visits Invisible Jones (Patrick MacNee), a man inside The Ministry, to investigate the meaning of a map Steed found at Wonderland Weather. After viewing some photos of failed genetic experiments including cloning (revealing that the other Emma Peel is a clone), Steed determines Father is working with De Wynter. Father and Peel's clone capture Peel but are confronted by Mother, who is then incapacitated. De Wynter, controlling Prospero and the weather, confronts the world's leaders. He boasts that he controls the weather, and they will have to buy the weather from him, will pay a lot for it, and will have until midnight to pay... ""The Avengers"" is a 1998 American action spy film adaptation of the British television series of the same name that ran between 1961-1969. Warner Bros., the film's distributor, refused to allow any early press-screenings for movie reviewers that most releases attempt to generate interest in; such a decision is often made when a studio and/or distributor knows a film will not be received well and pre-release reviews would only be negative. The film was originally scheduled to open earlier in June 1998 but was pushed back until August, often referred to as the late-summer ""dumping ground"" for films that are not felt to be strong or worthy enough to open on the more lucrative holiday weekends in early summer. The film was a notable failure at the box office, grossing only $48 million worldwide, compared to its budget of $60 million. Mick LaSalle, of the San Francisco Chronicle, warned against poor editing and direction, explaining; ""There's.......some business involving a dead ringer for Emma going around causing trouble, and there's some mention of the word ""cloning."" Then all talk of that is dropped. Everything is dropped. After a slow opening, the 90-minute movie jolts into climax mode. What happened to the middle? Clearly, this wasn't just edited but gutted. No doubt they did us all a favor, but it doesn't help. Instead of just being a bad picture, the missing middle makes ""The Avengers"" a bad and weird and strangely off picture. One example: There's never a moment when Emma and Steed realize who the villain is. At first, they don't know. Next, they're in a titanic battle to the death. At one point, Emma is shackled and floating around in a hot-air balloon. I don't know how she got there. I must have blinked. Due to internal wrangling at Warner Bros., the decision was made to vastly cut down the running time after test screenings, reducing the 115-minute film to 87 minutes, sacrificing much coherence and continuity in the process. Key scenes removed included the opening sequence in which ""Mrs. Peel"" infiltrates and destroys the Prospero science installation; early trailers included the scene where she says the words ""How now brown cow"" in a false telephone box to gain admittance. The movie was originally scored by composer Michael Kamen, who included the original Avengers theme; however he was unable to re-score the film after the radical editing, so was forced to drop out. The recut version of the film was scored by Joel McNeely. The original script was used for the film's novelization and included all the material which were first shot and then removed from the film. The original cut has yet to surface; Warner Bros. has no plans to release a director's cut or special edition in any form, despite that director Jeremiah Chechik has offered to recut the film for free. The film was panned by critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes consensus reads, ""A TV spinoff that lacks enough energy to spin, The Avengers is an ineptly written, woefully miscast disaster."" The purists disliked it for its disrespect to the original series (particularly the introduction of a romance between Steed and Peel - a carefully ambiguous subject in the series). Newcomers were lost by all of the misfired attempts to capture the mood of the original. Rod Dreher in the New York Post called the film ""a big fat gob of maximum crapulosity, the kind of shallow, stupid, big-budget cow pile that smells of Joel Schumacher"", referencing the previous summer's likewise poorly received Batman & Robin, which also starred Uma Thurman. David Bianculli stated, ""This Avengers film is so horrendously, painfully, and thoroughly awful that it gives other cinematic clunkers like Ishtar and Howard the Duck a good name."" Jay Boyer in the Orlando Sentinel said ""The Avengers is, without a doubt, the worst movie of the summer"". Reception in Britain was equally hostile. The Birmingham Post stated ""The Avengers is being slated by critics as the worst film ever made - such a turkey, says one, that the makers should have handed distribution to (mass turkey producer) Bernard Matthews"". Alan Jones in The Radio Times stated ""The cult 1960s TV series gets royally shafted by Hollywood in this stunningly designed blockbuster that's stunningly awful in every other department... Terrible special effects and zero chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman make this notorious disaster a total waste of everyone's time and energy."" Commenting on the truncated released cut of the film, New York Times's Janet Maslin noted, ""At a pared-down, barely rational 90 minutes, ""The Avengers"" is short but not short enough."" I did not grow up with the original ""The Avengers"" (1961-1969) but I know of the show, the main characters and the actors. This is yet another example of a film that was slaughtered in the editing room when they reduced the 115-minute film to 87 minutes, sacrificing much coherence and continuity in the process. Everything in the film feels random, campy, poor and as said there´s no coherence nor continuity which gives us a very confusing film. With A-list stars like Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman and Sean Connery you´d think there would be potential, but the end result is far from it. All three seems to have no idea what´s going on due to mediocre direction. I reckon charm, style and fun was the main pillars of the tv-show, but with the film all of that is not in place. It´s a weird and strange unfunny film in many ways and you really struggle to find anything that is good about it. The effects are shoddy and the script silly in an Austin Powers way. Once the colourful teddybears appears in the film you realise that this film will never recover. Trivia: Peter Bart's book ""The Gross"" covered the film's unfolding disaster in great detail. Among other facts: Warner Brothers greenlit the film largely on the strength of a star-packed cast and their appreciation of Jeremiah Chechik's work on Diabolique (1996) and were horrified when seeing what the first cut was like. The first screening took place in front of a ""largely Spanish-speaking, working class"" audience in Phoenix, Arizona, who hated the film; the studio then forced Chechik to cut many of his favorite scenes, and conduct reshoots; and the final cut went from 115 to 89 minutes, and was completely incoherent. The studio even refused to hold further test screenings, or to have an official premiere before the film's August 1998 release. Ralph Fiennes said of the film, ""I think it's a badge of honor to have a real flop on your resumé"".",The Avengers,The Avengers - Movie Reviews

It's not deep and only clever in its small details, but it is well constructed, well paced, well choreographed and features the type of performances perfect for a cast of actors who are mid-level at acting, but big on charisma. The actual bits where the cars go fast are intense, intricate and extremely well staged & well executed. Even better, this movie features a central villain played wonderfully by Statham and a muscle-baddie played by the always amazing Tony Jaa, and while the latter is notably underused, both of them are a lot of fun to watch when on screen, giving the silly-but-likeable heroes a larger-than-life obstacle. Honestly I strongly recommend this movie if you like well-made movies that don't require any usage of the brain to enjoy; like, if you've had a long and frustrating day at work and you want to enjoy something explosive while simultaneously relaxing, Furious 7 more than does the job.

Statham is great in his limited screen time, and the script and characters are great but the director couldn't pull it together with tension and visual realism like Justin Lim somehow perfected with the 5th and 6th films. Even with all the crazy stunts and set pieces in those two films, if felt very thrilling and weirdly grounded. Some moments recreate that style to an extent, but other moments fall flat in visual unrealism. The final act/set-piece, while very stupid however, was pretty awesome though.

I knew this movie was going to be dumb - they've all been dumb up to this point - but most of the rest of them have been dumb in a fun way. Unfortunately this one really flirts with just being dumb in a dumb way. The plot makes very little sense when it's given an ounce of thought, and characters inexplicably trust others for no reason other than to keep things moving. The humor is more forced than usual, with characters rarely leaving their archetypes. This movie is filled with tropes and cliches, but this franchise is so influential that it's hard to tell if it's regurgitating these tropes or inventing them. Also, Dwayne Johnson is severely underutilized. All of that being said, of course it's still fun. It's got the fast cars and the stunts we're expecting. The movie is stuffed with easter eggs and inside jokes (cars don't fly!). The familial theme is there, although not as obvious as in the previous entries, and there are heartwarming moments.

However, the fun continues making it likeable and fun enough to watch. In here Jason Statham is brought as the villain who is obviously one dimensional but has a legitimate grievance. The send off of Paul Walker incredibly works well although some of the scenes look weird knowing he is not really there but the movie pays tribute to the tune of When I see you again specifically written for his passing. Finally the Rock continues to prove how badass he is in these movies despite a limited role in this one.",Furious 7,Furious 7 - Movie Reviews

333,Stephy S,"Oct 23, 2021","An overall improvement upon its predecessor. Frozen II is exactly what you'd want from a sequel, more songs, more charming character moments and interactions and some absolutely gorgeous animation! First off, with this being a musical, you got to have some good songs and Frozen II definitely doesn't lack in that department, with the highlights being Lost in the Woods, The Next Right Thing and Into the Unknown. The acting was also top-notch as you'd come to expect from the returning cast. Especially Kristen Bell and Jonathan Groff deliver on some exceptionally charming and delightful performances. But without a doubt, the biggest praise I can give this movie is the animation. Hot damn, It's truly something else. The water looks too real for an animated flick and the movement is just as great and fluent. The character designs are also very exquisite and distinct. Unfortunately, it isn't all sunshine and rainbows. Some characters are painfully underutilized. Kristoff gets kicked out of the story early on and doesn't get to do anything meaningful and the new additions to the ensemble of characters aren't used in any meaningful in creative ways. All of these characters seemed to have some great potential for fun and quirky character interactions and had some noteworthy chemistry. Finally, the world-building is hit or miss. They introduce some really cool concepts and themes into the universe but they feel a bit rushed and half-baked. Some of them could've been thought out a little better while others feel like they aren't properly explained to the audience. In short, Frozen II might not be a subversive and perfect sequel but it's still pretty solid. It's truly a miracle this movie still turned out so good considering the rushed and problematic production.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews
334,Jan B,"Oct 18, 2021","As we all know, Disney has completely taken over, especially when it comes to movies. Frozen 2, amongst the singing and dancing, deals with real issues, like growing up and finding your place, your purpose. Though it may be a little heavy for some younger kids, those who grew up watching the first frozen movie, like me, find a real message embedded in the plot and various popular songs. The songs are just one portion of how the movie is dealing with these issues, such as change. For example, the first song describes how some things will be the same no matter what happens. Things like family and friends and true love. However, as the movie progresses we can see that things change regardless of what we do, some quite ironically if I might add. In the first song they sing about how the flag will always fly, and as soon as the spirits wake up and show their wrath to the city, the flag is ripped from the flagpole with the wind. For characters like Anna, this is a hard realization that things are changing. In the same breath, as those things change, we figure out a way to handle the change for the better, and that not all change is bad. Another topic they deal with is growing up. The kids who watched the first movie when it came out, grew a whole 6 years before the second movie came out. For me, I was in high school and applying for college when the second movie came out. Growing up is a scary topic and it could evoke some unhappy feelings for younger kids, especially those who don't like change. Frozen 2 also implies some falsehood about growing up, ""When you're older, absolutely everything makes sense"", as adults, we know this statement doesn't ring very true. On the same note, as you grow and go through life, you can find your place in this world, your purpose, just like Elsa and Anna did. Elsa found her place in the enchanted forest as the fifth spirit, and Anna found her place as the queen of Arendelle, which is arguably where they both belong. Aside from the positives and negatives to Frozen 2, I honestly think it's a great movie. It is more suited for slightly older audiences, but the topics that this movie deals with are important, even the heavy ones. Everything changes eventually, everyone grows up, but growing up and changing isn't necessarily a bad thing. It can definitely be intimidating, but it does ring true that no matter what changes, things will be okay. In my opinion, that is a great message for kids who are scared of growing up and finding their place in the world, like I was.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews

352,Manuela B,"May 28, 2021","I want to speak about Frozen II. This film is directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, they had realized the first movie also. The mains characters are Elsa and Anna the voice respectively of Indiana Menzel and Kristen Bell. The movie was released on 2019 by Walt Disney Pictures. The film tells a story of two sisters who lost their parents during the first movie. Anna and Elsa lives in the Arendelle's castle, Elsa is the queen. After the death of their parents, Elsa heard a mysterious voice call out to her. So she left the castle and the citizens to follow this voice. Anna, her sister is stubborn as a mule, she follows Elsa during this adventure. Many things will happen Personally I love this plot, I find it entertaining, touching and also interesting. In Frozen , there are a lot of specials effects. Elsa has a power, she can built an ice house, frozen the way, make a snow. Her power is very captivating, and beauty. For exemple in Frozen I Elsa make a snowman for her sister. The movie is an animation, the draws are very well done. The characters to appears real. I saw the making of, and it is a very long work. The details are important, we can see the emotions, the feeling of the characters is interesting. For exemple when Elsa sing, there is a close up, we see the character's face , the profound emotion. I thinks the script is good. For exemple Olaf the snowman is hilarious, even if is a snowman, the characters is lovable. We can laugh when he makes a joke. I recommended this film,to anyone who loves the Disney animation. Seriously, when I see this film I can cry, laugh, have all emotions. Waltz Disney animation makes characters very captivating. Songs are choose with attention. Everybody know « let's it go » this song is moving. I'm full of admiration for Frozen. The animation is difficult, isn't easy. Waltz Disney makes a interesting job. I'm never be disappointed by Disney Animation. Really go to see this film because is incredible.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews

359,Jesse D,"May 05, 2021","7.0/10. Have you seen the first Frozen? If you have kids, like Disney films, or have a pulse, it's more than likely you answered yes. And given that yes is your answer, then you have already seen the better of the two films. While Frozen 2 is still a good film, especially for those with children to entertain, it doesn't reach the heights of it's predecessor in any appreciable anyway. The animation is as good as ever, the perfect voice cast from the original return, and this heroine-led story has action, laughs, and some meaningful moments. But so did the first Frozen, which did all of that, but better. While the narrative foundations for Frozen 2 are arguably stronger than the boiler-plate fairy-tale original, this film adds too many unimportant characters and slices the film into separate plots that aren't always engaging. The tear-jerker moments don't jerk as effectively and the soundtrack pales in comparison it's counterpart; it almost concedes the point when it uses motifs from the original on more than one occasion. That's not to say it does any of these things poorly - this movie has heart and a good soundtrack, but it stands in the shadow of one of Disney's biggest recent hits. Some things never change, including that Disney's freshest ideas are usually better than the retreads.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews
360,Dollores L,"Apr 24, 2021","I thought Frozen 2 was a whole lot better than the first one. In the first one it overall just made me frustrated at what they did and said. I wholeheartedly agree that the songs in the first movie are 100% better than the ones in the second (minus Olaf's solo). However, in the second the characters look way more mature. I was so surprised when I saw how good they actually looked. Yes, I know that looks aren't everything but I thought that that was something important that should be pointed out. In the second I didn't exactly understand the point they were trying to get across though. What really saved the movie, for me, and made it a whole lot better was Olaf. He is by far my favorite character and I am guessing most everyone else too. Olaf makes the most hilarious comments and his solo song made me and my whole family laugh. Not going to lie, without Olaf the movie would most likely be a dud. I liked the story line of trying to save the enchanted forest and it gave me some real Moana vibes. I thought all the element characters were well thought out and I especially had a soft spot for the adorable little fire lizard/gecko. My least favorite part of the movie is either during the opening song ""some things never change"" or when Christoph has his solo ""Lost in the woods"". I was cringing hard during both of these songs. The first one that I listed was extremely sappy and made me shudder multiple times during the song. As for ""Lost in the woods"" I thought it was the most cringy of all the songs. It looked like they were going for an old montage theme for that song. I actually went to get refills for my drink and popcorn during it because I was so unsettled. (the popcorn was delicious by the way 🍿) I thought the songs were all sung extremely well and they even had me singing along at some parts. (I don't think the others in the theater were impressed though) I wouldn't consider this a must watch to those who haven't even seen the first but if you have then you NEED to see this one too. By the end of the movie you will have had some good laughs and I honestly believe that it won't feel like a waste of time.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews

The writing is witty and handles all the characters differently but emotionally and mostly in a clever way, with stand out characters being Tony and Wanda but the real pinnacle of the film being Ultron. Much like the movie, the only reason he is not the best villain in marvel is cos we have so many great ones, because Ultron is a hilarious and threatening, well designed marvelous (see what i did there) mix of Tony, Bruce and Vision who has motives that line up with Iron Man's character leeding to real deep dives into the sea of his phyce. The story is mostly simple, with many well choreographed but somtimes boring fight scenes and lot's of exposition but you have to remember that it's introducing three new characters here AND trying to move development on for the Og's. The movie set's up further Marvel movies, like Civil War, and gives our heroes something internal to recon with while still leaving us asking questions that we know will be answered.

397,Cailan D,"Jul 20, 2021","Avengers: Age of Ultron unfortunately falls into the ""sequel is worse"" trap. The writing and directing lack the finesse that they had in the first Avengers and are both awkward at times. Ultron, though Spader gives a pretty good performance as him, isn't the greatest villain because it seems that he dislikes the Avengers for reasons that aren't personal to him. He attempts to come off as sort of a ""people person"" but ultimately fails to do so because of his goals and execution. The humor is decent but not as good as it is in other MCU installments and is hampered by the script. The biggest issue of Age of Ultron is that it's a very ambitious film and tries to do too much with its runtime. There are multiple stories going on so as to set up future movies and the movie would've done better with a more specific focus. All that said, the actors as usual do their best to overcome the script and are successful at doing so in many instances. The chemistry between them helps to carry scenes where other elements don't work as well. One highlight of this film is actually one of the low points of the first Avengers, being Clint Barton/Hawkeye. This movie treats him very differently than its predecessor and gives him more screen time and moments to shine. His speech to Wanda during the climatic battle is one of the best speeches in the entire MCU and his arc gives more depth to his character and leaves plenty of opportunities for future development and storytelling. The action sequences are entertaining enough and should keep viewers engaged for the full runtime. While Age of Ultron is far from the best the MCU has to offer, it has some redeeming qualities and is worth taking a look at.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,Avengers: Age of Ultron - Movie Reviews

However, with certain deaths revealed the true glorious purposes that those characters were burdened with. I saw some of them in different light, and it was very sad. The beginning started just a little bit slow, but after that, the movie became unrelentingly thrilling. Even though it's the shortest in runtime in the franchise, I was basically glued to the TV the entire time. I sensed so much urgency in Harry and could not be more invested in him and his allies. The ending did not disappoint and delivered plenty explosion, wizardry, and valor from the characters. Everyone united and faced the strong and desperate dark lord himself. It was glorious.

The one 1/2 down-grade I gave it was actually due to the final duel scene with Harry & Voldemort, right after Neville Longbottom kills Voldemort's snake, Nagini, with the Sword of Griffindor. The simple cracking of Voldemort's face and then scattering away in the wind in tiny pieces was a complete slap in the face to audiences that deserved a MUCH more intense demise after following this movie series for 10 years. Lets face it, if we started our kids on the first movie at age six, they would have been sixteen when the last installment was released. I'm fairly confident they could have handled a more severe send-off to one of the screen's most hated characters. Did anyone in the theater you attended applaud loudly and yell vocally when Voldemort was defeated. Our's was packed and not a peep from anyone when he was killed by Harry. There you have it.

This movie hardly competes with any other because of its circumstances where the somewhat flawed buildup was all shoved into a different movie entirely, leaving this one with the sole task of delivering a lengthy fan-service climax to the entire franchise with a practically unlimited budget and plenty of characters whose arcs were 95% finished. The plot revelations were the best part of the movie, followed by the special effects, then the acting prowess displayed by the leads (especially Fiennes and Bonham Carter in this one), then the dramatic and memorable film score. The most touching scene of the movie and perhaps the entire series for me was Hermione offering to go into the woods with Harry - it came off incredibly altruistic and human, hitting me right in the feels unexpectedly in a way that Snape's memories did not. There were some things I would've preferred to see happen with the characters than what did, though that's mainly a very minor gripe with the source material. This was extremely successful as an ending to the series and deserves its spot as the highest-rated movie in it, even if that's mostly for getting to adapt only the exciting parts of one of the novels.

If the previous three film (Order of Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince, and Deathly Hallows part 1) if these films were the resistance underground films, this one is the out and out war film with wall to wall action, separated by a few tender quieter moments in between. In the last stand battle of Hogwarts everybody showed their bravery. Dame Maggie Smith's Prof. Mcgonagall got a moment to show how badass she is taking over Hogwarts, and Neville Longbottom was one of the most courageous young wizards, standing up for the Dark Lord himself. He was so brave he earned the right to wield the Sward of Gryffindor and truly save the day. That said, the true sacrifice came from Snape, the most misunderstood hero of the story. He gave up his entire life and managed to live as an outcast for years just to protect Harry and fool the Dark Lord, he managed to have a final moment with Harry which just made me very emotional. The final showdown between Harry and Voldemort was short and sweet. The Dark Lord's hubris lead to his downfall after our heros managed to take him down piece by piece working together, and utilizing the Deathly Hallows for good not for personal gains. The film then was bookended with a happy scene at the train to Hogwarts 16 years later, with the new generation of wizards starting their first year at the school.

Does this film play heavily on your memories and nostalgia of a cinematic masterpiece? Absolutely. Is this a Hollywood blockbuster to entertain your kids and eat popcorn to? Most certainly. But beyond that, this is just poorly made. After finishing the film, I had to wrack my brain for hours to try to understand what I witnessed, and what it meant. And I've come to the conclusion that it is simply confused. Masterfully confused. It tries both to be everything at once and an intricately focus-tested action romp. It tries to be a skit comedy, an action-adventure, a space opera, a drama, a romance, and an action spectacle. And it fails on almost all counts. At very least it was entertaining. If you enjoy Star Wars, you'll see everything you want to see here. There are X-Wings, and blaster lasers; there are jedi and lightsabers; epic swordfights, big explosions, and more. It's quite fun if you don't take it seriously at all! But that's the inherent issue, isn't it? Star Wars isn't just some nonsense sci-fi romp; it's one of the biggest sci-fi epics in the entire genre's history.

It's a phrase for killing the past, deconstructing old beloved characters, having stupid plot twist for its own sake, having no respect for the old fans at all, pushing a political agenda and using a franchise to parading your own ego as a filmmaker. What Rian Johnson did here - as a filmmaker (not as a person), is unforgivable. Many fans watched Star Wars in their youth when they had troubled times - they looked up to the characters - especially to Luke Skywalker. It's not only a shallow action figure - it was a symbol of goodness and hope. ""The Last Jedi"" makes a bitter, cynid old grump of Luke - who cowardly nearly killed his defenseless nephew, left his friends and family alone and dies off alone in the end.

Considering that they didn't quite know where this story was heading to, I think Johnson did a fantastic job. The theme of failure being a lesson throughout the movie was really cool to see. It wasn't just blasters and action and everybody wins; it was much more layered than that. Luke being an irritable hermit to me was very fitting after what he went through. And on top of this was the intricate budding relationship with Rey and Ben Solo was great. It showed them both of having flaws and I think that's needed in the Star Wars Universe more. Both feel lost and hopeless and alone, but they realize they have a connection this way. Is it a healthy relationship? Not at all but I like that it showed the grey of their personalities inside such and black and white universe. Also, bringing back the puppet Yoda made me tear up in nostalgia.

The script doesn't help--at every possible opportunity, the story is forced to be some sort of swelling, dramatic, climax--strange, since it is hard to feel anything given how soulless it turns out to be.

Rian Johnson is on record of saying the best films are ones that half the audience likes and the other half hates. Mission accomplished. Though I'd say it was 10/90 like/hate. The film's story had no cohesive structure. It was more like multiple, unrelated subplots hewn together like a kindergarten level collage.

The Last Jedi breaks everything we know as a trilogy... and that's perfect. You just have no ideia of what to expect, because actually, everything can happen at anytime, and things really does happen. Director Rian Johnson knows what make a Star Wars movie and a great sci-fi epic, setting the bars pretty high for this one visually, technically and narratively, not just making it a love letter for the real fans, but putting it up there with The Empire Strikes Back in a kind of surprising manner, while also setting it apart from his older ""trilogy brother"" by the inventively corageous plot, the gorgeous presentation and the mind-blowing twists.",Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,Star Wars: The Last Jedi - Movie Reviews

The lack of world building is prevalent The most idealistic person in the galaxy was turned into a cynical and brooding hermit. The fact that the true escape plan is kept from Poe Damaren is infuriating. They kill off Snoke and Captain Phasma before any arc can be established. Their main character is so utterly forgettable. Instead of exploring Finn's background they turn him into a bumbling idiot. He could of been a scarred anti-hero with a dark past. By attempting to subvert the viewer's expectations the film makers subverted all the fun right out of the movie.

Also, the Holdo maneuver would have been more effective at the beginning of the chase, thus saving the rest of the vessels of the resistance. Also, where is the rest of the New Republic military.

Here are my reasons: - Memorable and well developed characters. - An original and well-executed story. - A soundtrack that was only surpassed! like photography, it's the best! The original essence of the first movies is back! and the CGI is great! It is very well worked, you can see the dedication with which it was made. - Finally, we cannot forget that we will open the doors for what is to come in 2022 in Jurassic World: Dominion!

509,huyqiwd s,"Jun 24, 2021",Okay this movie sucks. I'll start with everything I hate. The movie is really cheap and it starts off with with claire wanting to save the dinosaurs even though they should be extinct. She cries about it. The trailers are also annyoing they just showed every single good part of the movie to make you think it is going to be good. They showed all of jeff goldblums performance and they try to shove in so many dinosaurs. It has an allosaurus a carnotorus a baryonyx a synoceratops and of course they are going to make rexy kill off the bad guy at the end. It is too predictable but perhaps the worst thing about this movie is they keep copying the other ones and they do that to much. It is basically the lost world but in a more modern way. The plot twist about the clone girl is stupid the characters are stupid and all while this is going you have bad acting unnecessary scenes and overall a horrible plot. The first scene is the only good scene in the whole movie. I think the worst actor of all is bryce dallas howard chris pratt was okay I don't know why he is so good with this role but so bad when he plays stare lord in the mcu. Speaking of marvel the jurassic world movies have so many actors that have been in marvel movies for example chris pratt bryce dallas howard ty simpkons vincent d'nofrio sam neil jeff goldblum jake johnson but that's not really there fault.

This is hands down one of the best musicals Disney has created. This starts with the amazing work of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez who were the song composers for this film and Christophe Beck who was the score composer. The score wonderfully sets the backdrop and the songs are all memorable and work so well with the themes and character arcs. The casting is also perfect as all the main character voice actors have experience performing on Broadway. The work on the animation is also well done with great particle effects for the snow and noticeable improvements on human hair. I understand the oversaturation of this film in pop culture, however I fully believe it is well deserved.

The first part was released in 2013 and made a splash. 3 Speaking of the plot, it is quite heavy even for an adult, because even my parents were touched by the plot. The drawing itself is at a height, everything is very clear and every detail is drawn, which pleases the eyes. One of the most important things is that even though it is a cartoon, but all the emotions are perfectly conveyed and touch the soul. Thanks again to the smallest details, you can very well understand each character, well, except for Prince Hans( my most hated character). Of course, the cartoon has a sequel, this is its second part, but the first one will always remain in my heart. Although, I don't mind the third part) so ""Frozen"" is the best animated film I've ever seen.

It really differs from your average Disney movie as it isn't based on ""true love kiss"" and ""boys"" and ""I need a prince to rule."" The characters are hilarious and make you smile. But if you are watching with kids you will probably be hearing ""Let it go!"" for weeks on end. Even as a teenager now, my little sister puts it on and I sit with her and actually enjoy most of it.

570,Dale R,"Nov 15, 2021","A live action remake of the 1991 animated film of the same name. There are some big names in this film: Emma Watson as Belle, Dan Stevens as Beast, Luke Evans as Gaston, Josh Gad as LeFou, Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, Ian McKellen as Cogsworth, etc. They all do a great job with what they are given, except for the music. With the exception of ""Gaston"", all the songs in this film feel unemotional and over processed. Some of this, I feel, is due to the fact that there is limited musical theater experience with the actors chosen for this film. Ewan McGreagor is good, but he can't hold a candle (pun intended) to Jerry Orbach's many years of musical acting experience. The CGI for the Beast's face was lacking and I'm sure it hid a great facial performance from Stevens. There were a couple of scenes where Watson felt like a stick saying, or singing, lines. The added material didn't feel necessary to the story, though some of the plot holes from the original film were plugged. Nostalgia fueled the success of this film and maybe that will be enough for you to enjoy it as well.",Beauty and the Beast,Beauty and the Beast - Movie Reviews

589,Urainia S,"Jun 07, 2021","I really love the moral behind ""Beauty and the Beast"", and it's the only Disney romance which still gets me. It's an important lesson about the ideas behind the curse of Beauty. In my mythological soup, this stands for The Judgment of Paris, where Aphrodite was chosen as the fairest (Athena DID NOT like this) because of her ability to provide a beautiful wife for the shepherd prince. The Beast becomes a Beast in mind because he has objectified his kingdom through beauty. Beast is a stand-in for Mercury, and/or Dionysus, and that's why the beautiful Athena-like witch shows up in ugly drag to test his hospitality. When he turns the witch away based on exterior appearances, not recognizing the beauty of her wisdom, she curses his kingdom to be physical objects until Beauty reappears. Then it's up to Beauty to reverse the curse through her wisdom, by seeing past the objectification of the Beast as a horrible animal to locked up in a mansion with his material things. It's important here that Belle is the hero. The Beast can't fix himself, he's the victim, and only someone who reads books and doesn't just stare at the covers can put it all together before the rose loses her last petal...",Beauty and the Beast,Beauty and the Beast - Movie Reviews

Best parts of the movie were indeed the raccoon, Jack-Jack, and scenes with Edna Mode. During the latter parts of the movie, I literally just wanted it to end. Three years (2015-2018) of waiting for this movie, walked out extremely disappointed. Watched it for the second time last night, no, just an absolute no. I understand the animation was smoother. But certain scenes were ""cut"" too sharply. The ending of Edna Mode's scene was abrupt, cant quite describe it. If you watch it at that point, you'll understand. So sad. There was so much potential.

627,Jacob R,"Jul 03, 2021","Ok, so this movie is pretty good, and has all the good stuff from the original movie, but it has a few too many problems that prevent it from being as good as the first movie. First, all the things that I thought were basically spectacular. All the stuff that involves them actually being superheros is really good, not better then what was in the first, but still really good. Next is the animation, which feels very different then all the others. This feels like it's stylized for the 1950s, which the film takes place. Some people can find that distracting, but I didn't. Also, all the new characters are either good or funny, except for one thing, but I'll save that for a little later. Now, let's talk about all the things that this movie just didn't do well enough in, which keeps it from being as good as the original. The main thing is really the characters that are brought back. Except for Elastagirl, Frozone, and Jack-Jack, all the old characters feel significant weaker. I don't want to say this, but the worse character in this movie by far is Mr Incredible. He is either acting completely crazy, completely mean or ignorant, or is not really blaming himself for everything that is going wrong with the family. I'm sorry, that's a huge problem that you can't fix with just one scene. Violet and Dash seem weaker too, but I was able to look past them. I, however, cannot look past Mr Incredible. Also, another big problem is the stupid twist villain. I know Pixar has done them before, but only one of them was actually bad (Miles Axelrod from Cars 2 ring a bell for anyone?). That is…until the Screenslaver shows up. This was the first time I was able actually to predict the twist villain in a Pixar movie, which made it super boring. It's also really hard when the last villain in this franchise, Syndrome, is the best Pixar villain ever. So, with all of that said, I still think this a good film that everyone should watch. All the superhero stuff (besides the villain), is still spectacular, you're just gonna have to sit through a bunch of the family stuff that isn't as strong. I think that's the biggest difference between this movie and the original. ""The Incredibles"" is a family and character study first, and a superhero movie second. ""Incredibles 2"", however, is a superhero film first, and a family film second. If you don't mind the change, then you'll think this movie is great! If not, like me, you'll only think the movie is pretty good, almost great. But hey, why listen to me? Go to Disney+ and watch this almost ""Incredible"" movie!",Incredibles 2,Incredibles 2 - Movie Reviews

But anyway, that's just a minor inconvenience. I hope that's the only problem I have with this movie, other than probably the fact that it's nowhere as memorable as the first movie. While The Incredibles is something of a pop culture icon this movie is, well, let's just say we'd have never learnt about it if it wasn't advertised so much. Incredibles 2 starts off from the part where the prequel left. And it finally answers the question of what happened in the fight between the Parr family and the Moleman - It... Happened. The only thing that came out of it was that Violet's BF learnt about her identity, which was later wiped out (or so I remember, I don't even think this movie was memorable enough. I'm remembering all the scenes as I'm writing this). So now Helen is out on another adventure, leaving Bob with the kids. And he's terrible at handling them. It was a very funny scene, seeing him struggle everyday trying to help Dash with his homework and Jack Jack in changing his diapers. The family moves into a new home which is way better than their previous one. Dash and Violet discover Bob's car and they bring it home. Then something something Helen finds out the guy who she's working with has a sister who is her costume designer, and she's secretly evil. And now it's up to the kids to save the day with all the superpowers and plot armours. See this is exactly the problem of this movie. It is super predictable, although that's not a bad thing since the way those scenes are executed make it very satisfactory to watch. The animation of this movie is probably the best thing about it. It is one of the only things which has improved drastically since the first movie. The Incredibles, you might remember, was very cool. But I just wrote a review of it yesterday and it was then that I realised the quality of that movie has aged terribly. In terms of polygon count this one takes the win. However, I also mentioned in that review that the thing which makes The Incredibles so much fun to watch is that it feels like a videogame, something similar to Sonic the Hedgehog or Spider-Man for PS4. That's not something I could say about this movie. Incredibles 2 isn't one of the movies Pixar is known for making. It's something of a sequel that can only satisfy you that the fight in the end of the first movie didn't end on a suspenseful note. It is a one-time watch for the fans of the first movie, although the kids might like it since the movie seemed to be more oriented towards them.",Incredibles 2,Incredibles 2 - Movie Reviews
632,Jerry S,"Jun 17, 2021","(SPOILERS) Honestly I am almost tempted to say I like Incredibles 2 better that the original. The characters are great as always and there is some real character development the music is spot on and I really enjoyed the moments between Bob and his kids and the awesome action sequences between Helen her self. I honestly have a blast watching this sequel, however the only problem that I have with this movie is the villain Evilen Deavor. On the one hand her character is really great. She and her brother Winston Deavor have interesting and intense back stories and have good moments with each other, however the movie kinda drags just a tad because there really trying to hide the fact that one of them is the main villain. Another thing is that Evilen's plan can kinda get confusing at times. However that doesn't mean that it takes away from the movie itself though. There is this seen with the Screen Slayer a villain that Evilen herself created and has some of coolest moments in the movie. However going into that seen though there are flashing lights so you have been warned. That scene was pretty thrilling and even haunting. However the best action scene in the entire movie was the opening which was just straight awesome and so satisfying.

Of course it's not the original but it took a well known story and added onto it perfectly. I enjoy how it focused on Elastagirl and really showed how before becoming a house wife she was a force to be reckoned with. I think the villain was very unique and there was a good twist added in. Th animation was really smooth and all the original actors came back which made it more fun for the audience because you can see how much they actually enjoy playing these characters.

645,"Mar 18, 2021","Incredibles 2 was so much better than the first one. I also love that it takes place right after the first film. Instead of a time jump. The animation was so beautiful and it looked real in a way. The plot of this movie was pretty good. I mean, in this movie I liked the villain, but with the kids saving the parents and most of the film is about Mr Incredible watching the kids, was not a good plot. That was the only thing I didn’t like. But other than that, I loved this movie. I am going to give Incredibles 2 a: A",SHOW MORE,Incredibles 2,Incredibles 2 - Movie Reviews

647,Michelle R,"Mar 12, 2021","La verdad espere por años esta película ya que sabía el enorme potencial que tenía, pero como últimamente ha sucedido, las secuelas solo han llegado para decepcionarme y desear que nunca hubieran existido. Siento que se fueron por lo seguro, por una trama no inteligente, sin gran desarrollo de personajes. Le quitaron todo el elemento adulto que tuvo la primera parte y con el cual podías hacer un gran análisis, incluso una introspección. Lo único que disfruté fue la pelea de Jack Jack con el mapache.",Incredibles 2,Incredibles 2 - Movie Reviews
