0,Ben W,6h ago,The best movie of all time,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
1,Aidan B,3d ago,"It provides groundbreaking CGI and is a well-acted film, however, the extremely generic story and mediocre plot end up bogging this film down. I think Cameron does a good job in directing this film, and the idea and worldbuilding was very well, however, the execution is poor as it just feels way more generic than it should have been. The acting is well though, and the CGI is phenomenal. There were also several plot holes, though I do hold hope that the planned sequel does expand well upon this film and better explains a lot of the things that occur. Overall, an entertaining film, just not one of Cameron's best works due to its lacking story.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
2,Rob T,"Nov 11, 2021","I didn't watch this in 3D but I did watch this on a big screen (not some 65"" TV) so I admit the visuals are quality but I'm guessing the 3D adds a lot more to the visuals. The story itself is unique, though there are some occasional scratch-your-head moments. I may be in the minority but it felt a bit weird to root for the romantic inter-species relationship. Still, overall a fairly decent piece of entertainment.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
3,Jon S,"Nov 10, 2021","Spectacular 3D visuals. Everything else (plot, character, dialogue, acting, pacing) was middling to bad.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
4,Michael P,"Oct 24, 2021","Unfortunately, this movie just hasn't aged well over the years. While the visuals are stunning (Pandora's flora and fauna) where built really well, great lighting, great photography work and the human portion of the dialogue isn't bad either, I just can't get past two big things in this movie a) the dialogue of the Na'vi - I mean, that is the best they could come up with? and b) the story arc - the movie is basically a mashup of Dances w/ Wolves, FernGully, and Pocahontas. Sure it isn't a complete 1 for 1, but for someone who had a lot of time to work on the story line, this is the best James C could come up with? (Dances w/ Wolves in Outer Space?) The technological concepts are good, but the story overtime, it just gets worse everytime I watch it. I cringe when I hear the Na'vi rally cry, its just culturally...well, insensitive. In this regard, the Na'vi language isn't original...of course, its a unique language completely made up (Frommer took inspiration from the Maori language)....and I guess that is my problem here. The vocal range is human, the language is based off a human language, the pitch and frequency of the spoken language is human. It just doesn't make a lot of sense...think about it, we share 98.8% of our DNA with chimpanzees, 70% of our DNA with zebrafish, and 60% of our DNA with bananas, and we sound NOTHING ALIKE! ;-) We travel to another fictional part of the universe and the Na'vi just happen to sound like one of our Polynesian languages hear on earth? If they are in the process of are being unoriginal, they could have at least given the Na'vi a proper Haka War Cry.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
5,Shane B,"Oct 20, 2021","When you take away the CGI and 3D effects, the movie itself isn't great. Go to a planetarium, you'll save some time. Dud!",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
6,Andrew M,"Oct 08, 2021","The world of Avatar is absolutely stunning. The visuals are remarkable, The Na'vi culture is very rich and Zoe Saldana does an amazing job in this film. A lot of hard work was put into this movie and it shows.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
7,Robb D,"Sep 09, 2021","What Avatar lacks in originality, it easily makes up for with stunning visuals and some amazing action. Cameron is a genius with a camera and his mastery is on full display to anyone who can view this beautiful film in the best HD resolution possible. 9/10",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
8,Eric P,"Aug 28, 2021",Here is a film that is truly amazing! The visual effects in this were one of a kind that were special and effective. The music and the scenes in Avatar gave me emotional feelings where I almost teared up. The action sequences in this film are amazing as well. One could argue that this movie is just Dances with Wolves knock-off with a hint of science fiction but the positives outweigh the negatives. James Cameron did a very phenomenal job directing this film.,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
9,Jordan H,"Aug 24, 2021",Cookie cutter plot. Saw it for the novelty of new 3D in 2009. No need to ever watch it again.,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews

16,Robert P,"Jul 23, 2021","The most expensive film to make, and currently it holds the biggest gross returns in history, I can only say this is the ultimate sci-fi adventure you can see to date!",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
17,"Jul 18, 2021","Probably the best Disney movie I've ever seen, ahead of it's time, watched it in theaters back then with 3d glasses and it blew any 3d movie out the water",FLAG THIS REVIEW,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
18,Dean S,"Jul 17, 2021",Saw in the movies in 3D so that was fun. But the story itself was pretty cheesy. I'm glad James Cameron stopped this nonsense and is now focusing on the epic story of Alita the Battle Angel.,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
19,Joe D,"Jul 11, 2021","To me this is the most perfect blockbuster of all. Love Sam Worthington's empty cup, I find his everyman acting compelling, Saldana may be the most beautiful woman on the planet with her trademark perfect posture, and Sigourney adds class with extra to spare wherever she goes. The planet Pandora remains the real star, and the revelation that we're the bad guys and the spiritual tree-huggers were right all along, I find genuinely touching every time. First class and I can't wait for more of Cameron's magic touch.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
20,Jimmy W,"Jul 10, 2021","The fact that this movie can make the most money of all time and also gain a following of hive-minded morons to defend it says more about the state of society than it does the movie itself. For a movie that's meant to make a point about abusive use of the environment, they sure seem to indulge in the use of massive amounts of expensive technology that no doubt utilized way more than its fair share of natural resources. Oh well, at least you can pretend to be vindicated by the box office numbers.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
21,Goudkuil E,"Jun 29, 2021","Apart from the visuals everything feels uninspired and thrown together using a old cliche of an outsider seeing what's wrong with what he's people have been doing falling in love then whiching sides. The acting is ok, the dialogue is kinda rough. The movie is padded with a lot of nice scenique views with no real narrative meaning.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
22,Antonio D,"Jun 15, 2021","o filme possui uma fotografia muito bela e, mesmo o filme sendo de 2009 não conseguimos encontrar defeitos em relação a montagem e fotografia, a história é satisfatória e é um reflexo do que sabemos que aconteceu no inicio da colonização",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
23,Tyler W,"Jun 11, 2021","The visuals were revolutionary for the time. But story matters and to the extent this film had a plot, it was borrowed from FernGully and Dances with Wolves.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
24,Noah H,"Jun 08, 2021","Great film through and through. The plot is excellent and engaging, and the character development is of a very high standard. Although it is a very long film, every scene adds to the atmosphere. Definitely worth watching - you won't regret it!",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
25,Erick F,"May 28, 2021","Filme perfeito. Edição, imagens, efeitos, narrativa, roteiro, atuações, planos de sequências. Incrivelmente extraordinário, te transporta para a incrível realidade de Pandora, e faz você de lá nunca mais querer voltar. Película completamente por múltiplas razões.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
26,Nathan t,"May 28, 2021","Avatar is an American science fiction film, directed by James Cameron and released in 2009. In this film we can find many guess like Sam Worthington or Sigourney Weaver. They portray Jake Sully and Dr. Grace Augustine. The main character Jake Sully try to understand how does a new specie live in Pandora. The film is about the probably future of humanity. The humans have deleted all the ressources of the earth, so they try to visit others planets for maybe find minerals. During this film we are on Pandora, a moon of a new planet. Human species can live in the Pandora's atmosphere, but scientist found a possibility to go discover all the planet. Take control of humanoids who live in Pandora. So we follow Jake Sully and Dr. Grace Augustin who will try to make contact with Eywa the chief of this new population. When I watched this movie for the first time the plot convinced me, because it is unpredictable and highly absorbing. There are many unexpected during all the movie. I must talk to you about the special effects. This movie is, for me, the most staggering film of the last 10 years. All jungle and humanoids made with special effects, the colors and the mood are very special. Each flowers or trees are detailed. It is perfectly stunning. The photography also is breathtaking, colors enable to convince all the viewers. There different cinematography techniques which give a beautiful introduction and transitions during the movie. Actors, portrayed, a human character but also a humanoid character, they must keep the same attitude and the same mouvements when they represented creatures. Each actor is natural and it's likeable to see. To sum up, I can say that this movie must be watch by everybody. With all work to make the special effects and the script, this movie seem prefect.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
27,Jasper S,"May 27, 2021","De wereld van avatar roept bij mij vooral emoties van verwondering op. De wereld is zo wonder schoon en goed uitgewerkt. Je kan de hele film 2 keer kijken 1 keer voor de film zelf en de tweede keer voor de visuals. Het best voor deze film is om hem in de bioscoop te bekijken. Daar in die donkere bioscoop waar niks uitmaakt behalve de film worden bijna alle zintuigen geprikkeld. De dolby atmos surround sound zorgt ervoor dat jou oren alles meekrijgen wat er om jou heen gebeurt. Van het kogelschot rechts voor naar het fluitende vogeltje links achter. Het grote doek zorgt ervoor data jou hele gezicht veld word opgenomen door deze adem benemende film. Je voelt misschien niks fysiek op je huid neerkomen maar als jij kippenvel krijgt van de film merk jij dat heus. Het jammere is dat je de film niet kan ruiken of proeven wat zou dat een beleving zijn. Dan zou er bijna geen verschil meer zitten tussen film en realiteit. Deze wereld bevind zich in het universum met de aarde. De wereld zelf bevind zich echter op een andere planeet binnen dit universum. De wereld lijkt erg op de aarde met het aantal gewassen die overal staan alleen is alles een stuk groter. James Cameron is de regisseur en schrijver van de film. Dus de wereld is in zijn hoofd gemaakt. De mensen die de wereld daadwerkelijk gemaakt hebben zoals jij het in de bioscoop mag zien is gemaakt door een groep van meer dan 1000 mensen een gigantische computer server en een groot budget. Filmen begon in april 2007. Dat betekent natuurlijk niet dat deze film toen al af was want hij was pas in december 2009 te zien in de bioscopen. Avatar is een box office film gedirigeerd en geschreven door James Cameron die zich afspeelt op een andere planeet. De boodschap van avatar is dat je zuinig moet zijn op je grondstoffen. En je zuinig moet zijn op de planeet waarop je woont. De doelgroep van Avatar is iedereen die van films houd vooral van een beetje science fiction. Er zit niet perse een leeftijd grens aan de film je moet alleen wel 13 zijn om de film te kunnen zien. Het verhaal van de wereld is dat de aarde niet meer goed bewoonbaar is en de mensen van de aarde naar een andere planeet gaan om daar grondstoffen te verkrijgen om rijk te worden. De hoofdrolspeler is een man die geen functionaliteit meer heeft in zijn benen en naar de planeet komt voor onderzoek. Hij gaat zichzelf over zetten in een lichaam van de inboorlingen waarin hij ook weer kan lopen. Het conflict van het verhaal is tussen mens/machine en inboorling/natuur. De inboorlingen houden namelijk van hun wereld en behandelen de wereld met de respect dat die nodig heeft en de mensen komen alles kapot maken. De hoofdrol speler zorgt ervoor dat er een connectie gelegd word tussen mens en inboorling maar stapt uiteindelijk over naar de kant van de inboorlingen om hun te helpen mens te verslaan. De characters Bestaan uit mensen, mensen in machines, Na'vi (inboorling), en meerdere dieren. In de wereld waar de mensen komen is alles een stuk groter dus de mensen maken exoskeletons om een kans te hebben. De Na'vi aan de andere kant zijn zo in toon met de natuur dat is een vlecht hebben waarmee ze een band kunnen maken met dieren. De sferen die in het verhaal komen zijn heel wissel valig door de film heen. In het begin is het vooral leuk dat je alles kan ontdekken en sta je achter de mensen. Als de hoofdpersoon met zijn lichaam van een na'vi het kamp van de na'vi binnen komt is er vooral liefde. Daarna sta je achter de na'vi en is er vooral verdriet over de destructie van de mensen. Maar op het eind is het euforie door de overwinning van de na'vi. Een hele achtbaan aan sferen dus De film word foto realistisch vorm gegeven op een 2d doek. Ook 3d als je de bioscoop extra betaald en je een bril opdoet. Het thema van de wereld is natuur en duurzaamheid.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews

36,"Apr 27, 2021","The main film of the year 2009 is «Avatar» by James Cameron, the producer of such films as «Terminator», «Titanic», «The Strangers». This film ranks with above-mentioned world-famous films and probably belongs to the science-fiction genre. The action of the film is set on the planet Pandora in the year of 3000. The plot is rather simple: the super hero Avatar is to save the alien planet and to fulfill this mission he struggles with a lot of difficulties. The main character, Jack Sally, is a disabled navy who has just come back from the war. The film starts with the scene when he is invited to take part in a secret expedition to the planet, inhabited by weird creatures. Thus, he becomes the part of the programme called Avatar. Being turned into a a three-metre giant with blue skin, he is sent to the planet with the help of special «drivers» that link his mind to the mind of Avatar. What impressed me most is the spectacular world of aliens that we, the audience, see through the eyes of the main character. The special effects and 3D technologies enhance the impression of the bright and colourful world in contrast to the human one, which is grey and dying. The plot of the film is fast-moving with some amusing episodes. For those who are indifferent to the computer graphics, there is another storyline that is love of «the dream worker» to a beautiful female alien, who, being hostile and suspicious at first, falls in love with him. Such love is forbidden and as a result the pair is chased by the aliens. Happily, they managed to escape in the end. To my mind, the brillant acting of Sam Worthingdon, who is starring in the film, is above all expectations. To sum up, I can say that the film «Avatar» is that kind of film that takes us to a special world beyond imagination. More than that, it is the film that you want to watch over and over again. Definitely, the new film by Cameron couldn't be missed.",SHOW MORE,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews

This is one movie that Just HAD to be seen in 3D! Loved it! Great action, special effects and a powerful story. The story has similarities from both Fern Gully and Dances with Wolves. I was blown away!! James Cameron did a great Job of creating this new world of Pandora and the Navi and the Beautiful creatures of this world. The cast such as leads Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana also did a tremendous job!

It's what I expected to see, after they've invested over $ 350 million doing it. And it's definitely what I was hoping to see to dramatically close a franchise that, in my opinion, should take a break so as not to saturate the genre.

59,Alex T,"Nov 16, 2021","I've always liked Marvel comics and followed the movies somewhat as a result, never really following the MCU, but due to movies like Endgame I feel like I'm really falling out with the fanbase. My view of Endgame is its just overrated beyond belief, I think the premise is okay in the sense that it ties all the previous movies up and includes many of the characters but its bad in the way in how destructive it is, disabling any kind of meaningful progression in the franchise. I feel in this way, the deaths in this film and the one before it are hollow where they have little meaning due to them being resurrected in a spinoff or in canon. Admittedly the special effects are impressive and the sheer scope of the movie is as well but is undermined by a destructive and substance-less story in addition to the its copious runtime. I'm sorry Marvel, you've lost me on this one.",Avengers: Endgame,Avengers: Endgame - Movie Reviews
60,Aidan B,"Nov 16, 2021","A fine film that, in my eyes, feels very overrated. The comedy feels more forced, the story is just constant fan-service, and the final fight scene feels more cringe than epic due to the goofiness of some of the choices they made (ie all the Avengers running in a line). While the beginning and ending was admittedly great, and the acting is still as good as ever, ""Avengers: Endgame"" just fails to hold a light to some of the far better installments in the MCU. While I still found the film to be mostly enjoyable, I was able to find enough glaring flaws during my rewatch to bring the score down.",Avengers: Endgame,Avengers: Endgame - Movie Reviews
61,Vito N,"Nov 15, 2021","After much thought I have come to the conclusion that this is my Favorite Movie of All Time. It's 3 hours long, and it's all worth it. There's so much to talk about this film whether it's the drama between Cap and his final fight, Tony and coming to peace with his father, or Thor realizing that it's him that makes the lighting and not the lightning that makes him. The action is the best it's ever been, the CGI is world class as always, and the performances from the entire ensemble cast is as good as it'll ever be. Is it a perfect film? Heck no, but it's as close to perfect as you could ever get, and it comes pretty damn close.

This classic movie has revolutionary CGI for its time, with the classic story of star-crossed-lovers transitioned to the Titanic perfectly, this film remains one of Cameron's best works ever put on the big screen.

85,Money G,"Nov 09, 2021","CMON! I was expecting more from the characters. I grew up in America and this is a movie commonly referenced in conversation. Sadly, it is a reflection of American taste and depth more than it is a beautiful movie. James Cameron extends greater consideration towards budget, set design, a panning camera, and scope of grandeur and disaster than what I identify as the real conflict worth tears. Not one person survived with a Third Class ticket. The rich negotiate, offer leverage, hide in spacious lifeboats and Rose survives instead of Jack. This is an accurate story but should be received as a tragedy instead of a romance. What lines of memorable dialogue are there? They pass the plot along, the ship must sink. There are memorable visuals, the set is magnificent, and the scene where voices stop and are frozen is excellent. However, unlike the iceberg, there is not enough depth.",Titanic,Titanic - Movie Reviews

100,Romina R,"Aug 30, 2021","There is a trend happening more now than ever where people hate on classic films for the sake of hating because they are classic films and loved by the majority of the public. As I start this ""Re-watching and Re-visiting films"" series, I will be repeating this many times. I do not quite get people's issue and ""beef"" (to put it less sophisticated) with Titanic. Is it one of the best movies of all time? Not quite. Is it a really well-done film that stays in our minds years and years after seeing it for the first time and if it is playing on a TV channel, you put it on? Why, yes. I understand the bother with a ""pointless"" love story plot line for dramatization but what's funny is that it works with the strong performances and magical chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet. But what I want to focus on in Titanic is the little scenes. There are many scenes where the tears uncontrollably fall down your face. Towards more the last section of the film where the boat officially sunk down, there is a shot from sky above of all the passengers screaming and flapping around the water. Up close, it is suffocating hysteria and from afar, it is just one sound in the middle of the gigantic ocean. People being left to die (as there are themes being shown of the lower class being purposely cast aside and the rich prioritized) and people coming to terms this might be their last breath on earth. Playing with camera angles intensifies a small scene for a viewer and makes that small scene stand out in a 3 hour movie.",Titanic,Titanic - Movie Reviews
101,JOHN U,"Aug 29, 2021","Shmaltzy, overly long, ridiculously well crafted and disarmingly heartfelt this movie is just larger than life. I think it's pacing problems are best summed up by the very first scene where Bill Paxton's character essentially does the same gag twice with the exact same reaction from his crewmember. Everything that is done in the present day in this film is essentially useless and definitely provides the most unnecessary though not the only element that makes this movie as grandiose as it is. I was ok with it all, but it made the film seem redundant in a lot of places. Do the present-day scenes add to the film? Yes, but only incidentally, it does put us in the frame of mind of the impending tragedy in a very delicate way and makes for a very meaningful and lovely ending scene but all of that was accomplishable in much less time-consuming ways. After all, the love story is the heart of the film, it would have been perfectly acceptable to keep it to just that. What happens on the Titanic is what really sets this movie apart. At it's core this is a romance and that's what gives the wide appeal of the film but in general terms, this is an absolute masterclass (and I can't stress that enough) in disaster film. I got the feeling that that was what drew James Cameron to the Titanic as a potential film, the slow sinking of such a lavish set piece, the impending and ever nearing doom as the water chases after our heroes as they struggle to survive. It is in the disaster elements (and in the glorious shots of the Titanic before that) that the film is entirely justified in it's longevity. The scale of such a disaster demands a film of such scale and Cameron was certainly the filmmaker, perhaps the only filmmaker, who was truly up to the challenge of giving the Titanic justice. So in terms of destruction, this movie absolutely floored me not even mentioning the staggeringly large scale and lavish set design. The scenes in the engine room particularly gave off a visceral sense of largeness and power that was awesome to behold even on my computer screen and the shots of the Titanic's propellers rearing from the water literally took my breath away. Its like this movie's sets are beefy. That's the word that came to me while watching it, I don't know why but that's what I thought. Of course, no amount of excellent cinematography, special effects, set design, music or sound editing will make a complete film and since we all know the story, a genuine personal touch was necessary for this movie to really excel. Well, I won't call it genuine per se but I will call it just as larger than life than the ship it took place on. I don't think it's a secret to anyone just how melodramatic this movie's nuclear romance between poor artist Jack and unsatisfied rich girl Rose is. I suppose it's also cliché to a point but I didn't really mind (it helped soften the cliches when James Horner's score just leans into the schmaltz with full force) I think the film does a good enough job with building up it's emotional center and it sprinkles in enough universally pitiable scenarios (the musicians, the babies, the families) to make it personally devastating as the long, slow burn of the Titanic's destruction unfolds in all of it's glory. The story didn't really hold any long-lasting meaning, but I don't mind that either, it was just a story aiming to be a crowd pleaser and a white knuckler at the same time, and it succeeded really well at both. I liked the whole ""jump together"" motif. Somehow, I didn't see its payoff coming and old Rose throwing the heart of the ocean into the sea really spoke some volumes about something… I don't know, it was emotionally resonant at the time. Came for the destruction, stayed with the romance long enough to actually get to the destruction and enjoyed the sweet, admittedly pretentious ending.",Titanic,Titanic - Movie Reviews

James Cameron achieved something remarkable in Titanic, with his relentless attention to detail, perfect direction and clever use of every trick in the special effects book to take the viewer aboard the great ship as she set sail in April, 1912. The underlying Romeo and Juliet love story of the film's two central characters, Jack and Rose, is engaging and bought to life by the perfectly cast Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet, who have just enough chemistry to make you care about their love story. A fantastic supporting cast of quality actors, perfectly cast, helps to bring this modern remake of A Night To Remember to life. You realise you have completely bought into the movie when you feel utter dread during the sinking scenes. Definitely one of the all-time greatest movies ever made.

The set is magnificent and the contrast between rich and poor as well as society expectation and free will is handled really well but the moment the ship hits the iceberg, it's near perfect. You truly feel the tension and fright as we see the effect of the sinking on so many people as well as the (let's be honest) terrible organization of the crew and the visuals hage aged super well. Hard to believe it's a 1997 movie. And gosh that last half made me cry, seeing the hopelessness of many of the victims and of course, Jack's death. I'm still pissed that Jack died but that bastard Cal survived. But still, incredible. It's definitely slow at times.

It is still just the third highest grossing film ever (however part of that comes from the 3-D rerelease) and still is quoted and talked about constantly to this day. Now is it a perfect movie, no. Is it overrated, absolutely. But there is still such a great nature to it that makes it honestly hard not to love (at least slightly). The first 90 minutes of the movie is essentially just a chick flick (and the writing is not the best) but it has such a charm to it and Leo and Kate’s chemistry is so likable that you can’t help but enjoy it (even if it isn’t the best). Then the rest becomes a completely different movie almost, as we see the titanic sink. This is where the movie really becomes phenomenal. The effects done and the cinematography and shots we get are great. Even though I’ve never really liked James Cameron much as a person you deny that he is a great director, especially with action scenes like the end to the movie. The entire last half of this movie is completely thrilling to watch and also it is heartbreaking when (spoiler alert) Jack dies (but you probably already knew that).

127,Aidan B,"Nov 20, 2021","""The Force Awakens"" opens this new ""Star Wars"" trilogy to an entertaining start, with groundbreaking CGI and action sequences, this film is easily the best in the whole trilogy. The new characters and places introduced are not entirely fresh or memorable, though they fit well into the story. Speaking of the story, I thought that this film was heading in a very interesting direction by making Finn, a stormtrooper that betrays the First Order, learn the ways of the Force. I also liked the character Rey, though I don't think that she should've been the main focus of the film. Kylo Ren is a very well done and emotional character though, and his connection to Darth Vader adds all the more depth to his character. Where I think this film fails, however, is the constant fan service that is done, which isn't done in a very creative way, rather it seems more of a cheat for that extra ""Hey I recognize that"" moment. It often plays on the nostalgia of those that grew up with the previous films and uses that nostalgia to power its main story.

154,Jacob B,"Sep 16, 2021",Star Wars 7: The force awakens (A-) (90%) Movie had so much hype before it's release and j.j. Abrams did a good job with it. Really wish that there was a more cohesive story throught the rest of the trilogy which ticks it down a bit now for me. But this movie and the other movies of the trilogy work better on their own then together. This movie in specific is just a whole lot of fun. Love seeing the rise of Kylo Ren (my favorite character from the sequels) and Harrison Ford back in action. Fun watch but don't get to attached to where the plot is taking the story in the other movies.,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Movie Reviews

It has a large number of characters, and I like that each one has their moment to shine, that's a plus point. The actions of each character are completely justified, Thanos as the main antagonist is perfect, the reasons for which he acts are given and he gives more richness to the film. Anyway, you can not stay without seeing Infinity War, it is a good movie but I think it was enough for more, that if, this does not prevent you from enjoying it at all.",Avengers: Infinity War,Avengers: Infinity War - Movie Reviews

214,Jon M,"Sep 23, 2021","The word ""soulless"" covers most of my issue. The voice acting was entirely lacking heart, and in some cases was simply given poor direction. (Mufasa roars, and asks ""Is that a challenge?"" As if he's inviting Scar to tea.) John Oliver was entirely out of his depth, Ejiofor gives zero malice to the role, Beyonce over-sings every line, and Seth Rogen's perfectly played irreverence stands as the one bright spot.

215,Jayden D,"Sep 22, 2021","I have NOT been a fan of the rehashed remakes that Disney have put out as of late (Beauty & The Beast, Aladdin, Mulan...UGH...,Lady & The Tramp...not bad but mediocre) though I have 2 exceptions, The Jungle Book and this latest rendition of The Lion King. To be real, there's never gonna be a Lion King rendition that's gonna come anywhere close to the 1994 classic, let's be honest with ourselves. However for it's credit, this remake did not want to make me leave the theater in disgust. If anything it's a good movie that it's worth a watch, you just gotta dial down your expectations of the movie because some parts of it are kinda watered down and a bit of filler moments are put in there too which would explain this movie being 25 minutes longer than the original. Other than that, it does follow the script to the letter and makes for a good nostalgia high with modernized graphics. Props to the CGI team, this movie does look beautiful, probably the highest mark of the movie. It's not a bad Disney movie at all, the unfortunate part is that it does not surpass what the animated classic has already brought out to us and those are shoes that are almost impossible to fill so I can understand this movie falling short in some parts. It does make for a good comparison of what is being brought to this generation versus what my generation got as a kid growing up in the 90's.",The Lion King,The Lion King - Movie Reviews

It feels less like a remake or re-imagining than a remaster - viewers who want a new spin on a classic will be disappointed to find they are paying to see a movie they've already seen (albeit with a new coat of paint). While it's a shame that director/producer Jon Favreau added nothing new to this tale (despite proving his capabilities with 2016's vivid and fresh 'The Jungle Book') it manages to retain the soul of the original and is sufficiently entertaining. Excellent voice and vocal performances couple with stunningly life-like depictions of wild Africa and it's animal inhabitants to satisfy fans hoping to relive an old favorite, while offering new viewers an experience approximate to what the rest of us experienced in 1994, albeit with less facially emotive animals.",The Lion King,The Lion King - Movie Reviews

269,Michael S,"Dec 23, 2018","As any hardcore fan of the TV series knows, no actress was ever going to be able to fill the tights of icons like Honor Blackman and Diana Rigg. The producers should have known such fans would provide not an instant audience but an army of instant deplorers many of whom notoriously refused to even see the movie. What idiot producer then provides not just one unacceptable Uma, but adds a second unacceptable Uma in the bargain (Uma's dual role as both Emma Peel and nemesis)? Poor Uma never stood a chance, given she is a notoriously verveless actress especially compared to Diana Rigg. Uma turned out to be much more suited to originating roles that she was capable of playing (see Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill). As bad an idea as casting Thurman (or anyone in a film that shouldn't have been made), there was a great idea in casting Connery as the Bondian villain and this was the only potential drawing power the film really had (it was the only reason I went to see it!). Connery appears to be having the time of his life portraying the essence of maniacal glee. The script is awful, even if the science is not gibberish it's delivered at such breakneck speed it comes off as such. The actors spout dialogue at each other to zero reaction, like each one is occupying a separate room. Fiennes is credible in the action scenes, but otherwise is so bland as to blend into the wallpaper. If Patrick MacNee had feared being outdone in the role, they turned out to be groundless. If you actually need a reason to watch this, there are a few good moments reminiscent of Peel-era idiosyncratic oddball Avengers style moments, such as the Spectre-like villains meeting at a round table disguised as different colored teddy bears.",The Avengers,The Avengers - Movie Reviews

The two head off to the Ministry to meet Mother (Jim Broadbent), who informs them the Prospero project - an attempt to influence the weather - was sabotaged apparently by Emma Peel. Dr. Peel claims she is innocent, but she is sent to work alongside Steed to find the real culprit. Mother's off-sider, Father (Fiona Shaw), claims Peel suffers from a mental disease. They go off to visit Sir August De Wynter (Sean Connery), an old ally of The Ministry. He takes an instant liking to Peel, as they both share a love of weather. Steed and Emma follow a lead to Wonderland Weather - a business that artificially creates heat or rain with a special machine - where they discover two dead men in teddy bear suits. The members of a secret organisation - led by De Wynter - all wear teddy bear suits to disguise their identities. One of them, however, looks exactly like Emma Peel. Steed arrives in time to save Peel, as the double jumps off a roof and disappears. Steed and Emma go off to visit De Wynter at his mansion but are attacked by mechanical bees. Alice (Eileen Atkins), a Ministry agent, helps them to flee; nevertheless, De Wynter captures Emma who then tries to escape but finds herself trapped due to the mansion's ever-changing floor plan. She smashes her way through a window, and Steed rescues her. Back at Steed's apartment, however, Peel is arrested by Father, as Steed visits Invisible Jones (Patrick MacNee), a man inside The Ministry, to investigate the meaning of a map Steed found at Wonderland Weather. After viewing some photos of failed genetic experiments including cloning (revealing that the other Emma Peel is a clone), Steed determines Father is working with De Wynter. Father and Peel's clone capture Peel but are confronted by Mother, who is then incapacitated. De Wynter, controlling Prospero and the weather, confronts the world's leaders. He boasts that he controls the weather, and they will have to buy the weather from him, will pay a lot for it, and will have until midnight to pay... ""The Avengers"" is a 1998 American action spy film adaptation of the British television series of the same name that ran between 1961-1969. Warner Bros., the film's distributor, refused to allow any early press-screenings for movie reviewers that most releases attempt to generate interest in; such a decision is often made when a studio and/or distributor knows a film will not be received well and pre-release reviews would only be negative. The film was originally scheduled to open earlier in June 1998 but was pushed back until August, often referred to as the late-summer ""dumping ground"" for films that are not felt to be strong or worthy enough to open on the more lucrative holiday weekends in early summer. The film was a notable failure at the box office, grossing only $48 million worldwide, compared to its budget of $60 million. Mick LaSalle, of the San Francisco Chronicle, warned against poor editing and direction, explaining; ""There's.......some business involving a dead ringer for Emma going around causing trouble, and there's some mention of the word ""cloning."" Then all talk of that is dropped. Everything is dropped. After a slow opening, the 90-minute movie jolts into climax mode. What happened to the middle? Clearly, this wasn't just edited but gutted. No doubt they did us all a favor, but it doesn't help. Instead of just being a bad picture, the missing middle makes ""The Avengers"" a bad and weird and strangely off picture. One example: There's never a moment when Emma and Steed realize who the villain is. At first, they don't know. Next, they're in a titanic battle to the death. At one point, Emma is shackled and floating around in a hot-air balloon. I don't know how she got there. I must have blinked. Due to internal wrangling at Warner Bros., the decision was made to vastly cut down the running time after test screenings, reducing the 115-minute film to 87 minutes, sacrificing much coherence and continuity in the process. Key scenes removed included the opening sequence in which ""Mrs. Peel"" infiltrates and destroys the Prospero science installation; early trailers included the scene where she says the words ""How now brown cow"" in a false telephone box to gain admittance. The movie was originally scored by composer Michael Kamen, who included the original Avengers theme; however he was unable to re-score the film after the radical editing, so was forced to drop out. The recut version of the film was scored by Joel McNeely. The original script was used for the film's novelization and included all the material which were first shot and then removed from the film. The original cut has yet to surface; Warner Bros. has no plans to release a director's cut or special edition in any form, despite that director Jeremiah Chechik has offered to recut the film for free. The film was panned by critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes consensus reads, ""A TV spinoff that lacks enough energy to spin, The Avengers is an ineptly written, woefully miscast disaster."" The purists disliked it for its disrespect to the original series (particularly the introduction of a romance between Steed and Peel - a carefully ambiguous subject in the series). Newcomers were lost by all of the misfired attempts to capture the mood of the original. Rod Dreher in the New York Post called the film ""a big fat gob of maximum crapulosity, the kind of shallow, stupid, big-budget cow pile that smells of Joel Schumacher"", referencing the previous summer's likewise poorly received Batman & Robin, which also starred Uma Thurman. David Bianculli stated, ""This Avengers film is so horrendously, painfully, and thoroughly awful that it gives other cinematic clunkers like Ishtar and Howard the Duck a good name."" Jay Boyer in the Orlando Sentinel said ""The Avengers is, without a doubt, the worst movie of the summer"". Reception in Britain was equally hostile. The Birmingham Post stated ""The Avengers is being slated by critics as the worst film ever made - such a turkey, says one, that the makers should have handed distribution to (mass turkey producer) Bernard Matthews"". Alan Jones in The Radio Times stated ""The cult 1960s TV series gets royally shafted by Hollywood in this stunningly designed blockbuster that's stunningly awful in every other department... Terrible special effects and zero chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman make this notorious disaster a total waste of everyone's time and energy."" Commenting on the truncated released cut of the film, New York Times's Janet Maslin noted, ""At a pared-down, barely rational 90 minutes, ""The Avengers"" is short but not short enough."" I did not grow up with the original ""The Avengers"" (1961-1969) but I know of the show, the main characters and the actors. This is yet another example of a film that was slaughtered in the editing room when they reduced the 115-minute film to 87 minutes, sacrificing much coherence and continuity in the process. Everything in the film feels random, campy, poor and as said there´s no coherence nor continuity which gives us a very confusing film. With A-list stars like Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman and Sean Connery you´d think there would be potential, but the end result is far from it. All three seems to have no idea what´s going on due to mediocre direction. I reckon charm, style and fun was the main pillars of the tv-show, but with the film all of that is not in place. It´s a weird and strange unfunny film in many ways and you really struggle to find anything that is good about it. The effects are shoddy and the script silly in an Austin Powers way. Once the colourful teddybears appears in the film you realise that this film will never recover. Trivia: Peter Bart's book ""The Gross"" covered the film's unfolding disaster in great detail. Among other facts: Warner Brothers greenlit the film largely on the strength of a star-packed cast and their appreciation of Jeremiah Chechik's work on Diabolique (1996) and were horrified when seeing what the first cut was like. The first screening took place in front of a ""largely Spanish-speaking, working class"" audience in Phoenix, Arizona, who hated the film; the studio then forced Chechik to cut many of his favorite scenes, and conduct reshoots; and the final cut went from 115 to 89 minutes, and was completely incoherent. The studio even refused to hold further test screenings, or to have an official premiere before the film's August 1998 release. Ralph Fiennes said of the film, ""I think it's a badge of honor to have a real flop on your resumé"".",The Avengers,The Avengers - Movie Reviews

It's not deep and only clever in its small details, but it is well constructed, well paced, well choreographed and features the type of performances perfect for a cast of actors who are mid-level at acting, but big on charisma. The actual bits where the cars go fast are intense, intricate and extremely well staged & well executed. Even better, this movie features a central villain played wonderfully by Statham and a muscle-baddie played by the always amazing Tony Jaa, and while the latter is notably underused, both of them are a lot of fun to watch when on screen, giving the silly-but-likeable heroes a larger-than-life obstacle. Honestly I strongly recommend this movie if you like well-made movies that don't require any usage of the brain to enjoy; like, if you've had a long and frustrating day at work and you want to enjoy something explosive while simultaneously relaxing, Furious 7 more than does the job.

Statham is great in his limited screen time, and the script and characters are great but the director couldn't pull it together with tension and visual realism like Justin Lim somehow perfected with the 5th and 6th films. Even with all the crazy stunts and set pieces in those two films, if felt very thrilling and weirdly grounded. Some moments recreate that style to an extent, but other moments fall flat in visual unrealism. The final act/set-piece, while very stupid however, was pretty awesome though.

I knew this movie was going to be dumb - they've all been dumb up to this point - but most of the rest of them have been dumb in a fun way. Unfortunately this one really flirts with just being dumb in a dumb way. The plot makes very little sense when it's given an ounce of thought, and characters inexplicably trust others for no reason other than to keep things moving. The humor is more forced than usual, with characters rarely leaving their archetypes. This movie is filled with tropes and cliches, but this franchise is so influential that it's hard to tell if it's regurgitating these tropes or inventing them. Also, Dwayne Johnson is severely underutilized. All of that being said, of course it's still fun. It's got the fast cars and the stunts we're expecting. The movie is stuffed with easter eggs and inside jokes (cars don't fly!). The familial theme is there, although not as obvious as in the previous entries, and there are heartwarming moments.

However, the fun continues making it likeable and fun enough to watch. In here Jason Statham is brought as the villain who is obviously one dimensional but has a legitimate grievance. The send off of Paul Walker incredibly works well although some of the scenes look weird knowing he is not really there but the movie pays tribute to the tune of When I see you again specifically written for his passing. Finally the Rock continues to prove how badass he is in these movies despite a limited role in this one.",Furious 7,Furious 7 - Movie Reviews

333,Stephy S,"Oct 23, 2021","An overall improvement upon its predecessor. Frozen II is exactly what you'd want from a sequel, more songs, more charming character moments and interactions and some absolutely gorgeous animation! First off, with this being a musical, you got to have some good songs and Frozen II definitely doesn't lack in that department, with the highlights being Lost in the Woods, The Next Right Thing and Into the Unknown. The acting was also top-notch as you'd come to expect from the returning cast. Especially Kristen Bell and Jonathan Groff deliver on some exceptionally charming and delightful performances. But without a doubt, the biggest praise I can give this movie is the animation. Hot damn, It's truly something else. The water looks too real for an animated flick and the movement is just as great and fluent. The character designs are also very exquisite and distinct. Unfortunately, it isn't all sunshine and rainbows. Some characters are painfully underutilized. Kristoff gets kicked out of the story early on and doesn't get to do anything meaningful and the new additions to the ensemble of characters aren't used in any meaningful in creative ways. All of these characters seemed to have some great potential for fun and quirky character interactions and had some noteworthy chemistry. Finally, the world-building is hit or miss. They introduce some really cool concepts and themes into the universe but they feel a bit rushed and half-baked. Some of them could've been thought out a little better while others feel like they aren't properly explained to the audience. In short, Frozen II might not be a subversive and perfect sequel but it's still pretty solid. It's truly a miracle this movie still turned out so good considering the rushed and problematic production.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews
334,Jan B,"Oct 18, 2021","As we all know, Disney has completely taken over, especially when it comes to movies. Frozen 2, amongst the singing and dancing, deals with real issues, like growing up and finding your place, your purpose. Though it may be a little heavy for some younger kids, those who grew up watching the first frozen movie, like me, find a real message embedded in the plot and various popular songs. The songs are just one portion of how the movie is dealing with these issues, such as change. For example, the first song describes how some things will be the same no matter what happens. Things like family and friends and true love. However, as the movie progresses we can see that things change regardless of what we do, some quite ironically if I might add. In the first song they sing about how the flag will always fly, and as soon as the spirits wake up and show their wrath to the city, the flag is ripped from the flagpole with the wind. For characters like Anna, this is a hard realization that things are changing. In the same breath, as those things change, we figure out a way to handle the change for the better, and that not all change is bad. Another topic they deal with is growing up. The kids who watched the first movie when it came out, grew a whole 6 years before the second movie came out. For me, I was in high school and applying for college when the second movie came out. Growing up is a scary topic and it could evoke some unhappy feelings for younger kids, especially those who don't like change. Frozen 2 also implies some falsehood about growing up, ""When you're older, absolutely everything makes sense"", as adults, we know this statement doesn't ring very true. On the same note, as you grow and go through life, you can find your place in this world, your purpose, just like Elsa and Anna did. Elsa found her place in the enchanted forest as the fifth spirit, and Anna found her place as the queen of Arendelle, which is arguably where they both belong. Aside from the positives and negatives to Frozen 2, I honestly think it's a great movie. It is more suited for slightly older audiences, but the topics that this movie deals with are important, even the heavy ones. Everything changes eventually, everyone grows up, but growing up and changing isn't necessarily a bad thing. It can definitely be intimidating, but it does ring true that no matter what changes, things will be okay. In my opinion, that is a great message for kids who are scared of growing up and finding their place in the world, like I was.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews

352,Manuela B,"May 28, 2021","I want to speak about Frozen II. This film is directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, they had realized the first movie also. The mains characters are Elsa and Anna the voice respectively of Indiana Menzel and Kristen Bell. The movie was released on 2019 by Walt Disney Pictures. The film tells a story of two sisters who lost their parents during the first movie. Anna and Elsa lives in the Arendelle's castle, Elsa is the queen. After the death of their parents, Elsa heard a mysterious voice call out to her. So she left the castle and the citizens to follow this voice. Anna, her sister is stubborn as a mule, she follows Elsa during this adventure. Many things will happen Personally I love this plot, I find it entertaining, touching and also interesting. In Frozen , there are a lot of specials effects. Elsa has a power, she can built an ice house, frozen the way, make a snow. Her power is very captivating, and beauty. For exemple in Frozen I Elsa make a snowman for her sister. The movie is an animation, the draws are very well done. The characters to appears real. I saw the making of, and it is a very long work. The details are important, we can see the emotions, the feeling of the characters is interesting. For exemple when Elsa sing, there is a close up, we see the character's face , the profound emotion. I thinks the script is good. For exemple Olaf the snowman is hilarious, even if is a snowman, the characters is lovable. We can laugh when he makes a joke. I recommended this film,to anyone who loves the Disney animation. Seriously, when I see this film I can cry, laugh, have all emotions. Waltz Disney animation makes characters very captivating. Songs are choose with attention. Everybody know « let's it go » this song is moving. I'm full of admiration for Frozen. The animation is difficult, isn't easy. Waltz Disney makes a interesting job. I'm never be disappointed by Disney Animation. Really go to see this film because is incredible.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews

359,Jesse D,"May 05, 2021","7.0/10. Have you seen the first Frozen? If you have kids, like Disney films, or have a pulse, it's more than likely you answered yes. And given that yes is your answer, then you have already seen the better of the two films. While Frozen 2 is still a good film, especially for those with children to entertain, it doesn't reach the heights of it's predecessor in any appreciable anyway. The animation is as good as ever, the perfect voice cast from the original return, and this heroine-led story has action, laughs, and some meaningful moments. But so did the first Frozen, which did all of that, but better. While the narrative foundations for Frozen 2 are arguably stronger than the boiler-plate fairy-tale original, this film adds too many unimportant characters and slices the film into separate plots that aren't always engaging. The tear-jerker moments don't jerk as effectively and the soundtrack pales in comparison it's counterpart; it almost concedes the point when it uses motifs from the original on more than one occasion. That's not to say it does any of these things poorly - this movie has heart and a good soundtrack, but it stands in the shadow of one of Disney's biggest recent hits. Some things never change, including that Disney's freshest ideas are usually better than the retreads.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews
360,Dollores L,"Apr 24, 2021","I thought Frozen 2 was a whole lot better than the first one. In the first one it overall just made me frustrated at what they did and said. I wholeheartedly agree that the songs in the first movie are 100% better than the ones in the second (minus Olaf's solo). However, in the second the characters look way more mature. I was so surprised when I saw how good they actually looked. Yes, I know that looks aren't everything but I thought that that was something important that should be pointed out. In the second I didn't exactly understand the point they were trying to get across though. What really saved the movie, for me, and made it a whole lot better was Olaf. He is by far my favorite character and I am guessing most everyone else too. Olaf makes the most hilarious comments and his solo song made me and my whole family laugh. Not going to lie, without Olaf the movie would most likely be a dud. I liked the story line of trying to save the enchanted forest and it gave me some real Moana vibes. I thought all the element characters were well thought out and I especially had a soft spot for the adorable little fire lizard/gecko. My least favorite part of the movie is either during the opening song ""some things never change"" or when Christoph has his solo ""Lost in the woods"". I was cringing hard during both of these songs. The first one that I listed was extremely sappy and made me shudder multiple times during the song. As for ""Lost in the woods"" I thought it was the most cringy of all the songs. It looked like they were going for an old montage theme for that song. I actually went to get refills for my drink and popcorn during it because I was so unsettled. (the popcorn was delicious by the way 🍿) I thought the songs were all sung extremely well and they even had me singing along at some parts. (I don't think the others in the theater were impressed though) I wouldn't consider this a must watch to those who haven't even seen the first but if you have then you NEED to see this one too. By the end of the movie you will have had some good laughs and I honestly believe that it won't feel like a waste of time.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews

The writing is witty and handles all the characters differently but emotionally and mostly in a clever way, with stand out characters being Tony and Wanda but the real pinnacle of the film being Ultron. Much like the movie, the only reason he is not the best villain in marvel is cos we have so many great ones, because Ultron is a hilarious and threatening, well designed marvelous (see what i did there) mix of Tony, Bruce and Vision who has motives that line up with Iron Man's character leeding to real deep dives into the sea of his phyce. The story is mostly simple, with many well choreographed but somtimes boring fight scenes and lot's of exposition but you have to remember that it's introducing three new characters here AND trying to move development on for the Og's. The movie set's up further Marvel movies, like Civil War, and gives our heroes something internal to recon with while still leaving us asking questions that we know will be answered.

397,Cailan D,"Jul 20, 2021","Avengers: Age of Ultron unfortunately falls into the ""sequel is worse"" trap. The writing and directing lack the finesse that they had in the first Avengers and are both awkward at times. Ultron, though Spader gives a pretty good performance as him, isn't the greatest villain because it seems that he dislikes the Avengers for reasons that aren't personal to him. He attempts to come off as sort of a ""people person"" but ultimately fails to do so because of his goals and execution. The humor is decent but not as good as it is in other MCU installments and is hampered by the script. The biggest issue of Age of Ultron is that it's a very ambitious film and tries to do too much with its runtime. There are multiple stories going on so as to set up future movies and the movie would've done better with a more specific focus. All that said, the actors as usual do their best to overcome the script and are successful at doing so in many instances. The chemistry between them helps to carry scenes where other elements don't work as well. One highlight of this film is actually one of the low points of the first Avengers, being Clint Barton/Hawkeye. This movie treats him very differently than its predecessor and gives him more screen time and moments to shine. His speech to Wanda during the climatic battle is one of the best speeches in the entire MCU and his arc gives more depth to his character and leaves plenty of opportunities for future development and storytelling. The action sequences are entertaining enough and should keep viewers engaged for the full runtime. While Age of Ultron is far from the best the MCU has to offer, it has some redeeming qualities and is worth taking a look at.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,Avengers: Age of Ultron - Movie Reviews

However, with certain deaths revealed the true glorious purposes that those characters were burdened with. I saw some of them in different light, and it was very sad. The beginning started just a little bit slow, but after that, the movie became unrelentingly thrilling. Even though it's the shortest in runtime in the franchise, I was basically glued to the TV the entire time. I sensed so much urgency in Harry and could not be more invested in him and his allies. The ending did not disappoint and delivered plenty explosion, wizardry, and valor from the characters. Everyone united and faced the strong and desperate dark lord himself. It was glorious.

The one 1/2 down-grade I gave it was actually due to the final duel scene with Harry & Voldemort, right after Neville Longbottom kills Voldemort's snake, Nagini, with the Sword of Griffindor. The simple cracking of Voldemort's face and then scattering away in the wind in tiny pieces was a complete slap in the face to audiences that deserved a MUCH more intense demise after following this movie series for 10 years. Lets face it, if we started our kids on the first movie at age six, they would have been sixteen when the last installment was released. I'm fairly confident they could have handled a more severe send-off to one of the screen's most hated characters. Did anyone in the theater you attended applaud loudly and yell vocally when Voldemort was defeated. Our's was packed and not a peep from anyone when he was killed by Harry. There you have it.

This movie hardly competes with any other because of its circumstances where the somewhat flawed buildup was all shoved into a different movie entirely, leaving this one with the sole task of delivering a lengthy fan-service climax to the entire franchise with a practically unlimited budget and plenty of characters whose arcs were 95% finished. The plot revelations were the best part of the movie, followed by the special effects, then the acting prowess displayed by the leads (especially Fiennes and Bonham Carter in this one), then the dramatic and memorable film score. The most touching scene of the movie and perhaps the entire series for me was Hermione offering to go into the woods with Harry - it came off incredibly altruistic and human, hitting me right in the feels unexpectedly in a way that Snape's memories did not. There were some things I would've preferred to see happen with the characters than what did, though that's mainly a very minor gripe with the source material. This was extremely successful as an ending to the series and deserves its spot as the highest-rated movie in it, even if that's mostly for getting to adapt only the exciting parts of one of the novels.

If the previous three film (Order of Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince, and Deathly Hallows part 1) if these films were the resistance underground films, this one is the out and out war film with wall to wall action, separated by a few tender quieter moments in between. In the last stand battle of Hogwarts everybody showed their bravery. Dame Maggie Smith's Prof. Mcgonagall got a moment to show how badass she is taking over Hogwarts, and Neville Longbottom was one of the most courageous young wizards, standing up for the Dark Lord himself. He was so brave he earned the right to wield the Sward of Gryffindor and truly save the day. That said, the true sacrifice came from Snape, the most misunderstood hero of the story. He gave up his entire life and managed to live as an outcast for years just to protect Harry and fool the Dark Lord, he managed to have a final moment with Harry which just made me very emotional. The final showdown between Harry and Voldemort was short and sweet. The Dark Lord's hubris lead to his downfall after our heros managed to take him down piece by piece working together, and utilizing the Deathly Hallows for good not for personal gains. The film then was bookended with a happy scene at the train to Hogwarts 16 years later, with the new generation of wizards starting their first year at the school.

Does this film play heavily on your memories and nostalgia of a cinematic masterpiece? Absolutely. Is this a Hollywood blockbuster to entertain your kids and eat popcorn to? Most certainly. But beyond that, this is just poorly made. After finishing the film, I had to wrack my brain for hours to try to understand what I witnessed, and what it meant. And I've come to the conclusion that it is simply confused. Masterfully confused. It tries both to be everything at once and an intricately focus-tested action romp. It tries to be a skit comedy, an action-adventure, a space opera, a drama, a romance, and an action spectacle. And it fails on almost all counts. At very least it was entertaining. If you enjoy Star Wars, you'll see everything you want to see here. There are X-Wings, and blaster lasers; there are jedi and lightsabers; epic swordfights, big explosions, and more. It's quite fun if you don't take it seriously at all! But that's the inherent issue, isn't it? Star Wars isn't just some nonsense sci-fi romp; it's one of the biggest sci-fi epics in the entire genre's history.

It's a phrase for killing the past, deconstructing old beloved characters, having stupid plot twist for its own sake, having no respect for the old fans at all, pushing a political agenda and using a franchise to parading your own ego as a filmmaker. What Rian Johnson did here - as a filmmaker (not as a person), is unforgivable. Many fans watched Star Wars in their youth when they had troubled times - they looked up to the characters - especially to Luke Skywalker. It's not only a shallow action figure - it was a symbol of goodness and hope. ""The Last Jedi"" makes a bitter, cynid old grump of Luke - who cowardly nearly killed his defenseless nephew, left his friends and family alone and dies off alone in the end.

Considering that they didn't quite know where this story was heading to, I think Johnson did a fantastic job. The theme of failure being a lesson throughout the movie was really cool to see. It wasn't just blasters and action and everybody wins; it was much more layered than that. Luke being an irritable hermit to me was very fitting after what he went through. And on top of this was the intricate budding relationship with Rey and Ben Solo was great. It showed them both of having flaws and I think that's needed in the Star Wars Universe more. Both feel lost and hopeless and alone, but they realize they have a connection this way. Is it a healthy relationship? Not at all but I like that it showed the grey of their personalities inside such and black and white universe. Also, bringing back the puppet Yoda made me tear up in nostalgia.

The script doesn't help--at every possible opportunity, the story is forced to be some sort of swelling, dramatic, climax--strange, since it is hard to feel anything given how soulless it turns out to be.

Rian Johnson is on record of saying the best films are ones that half the audience likes and the other half hates. Mission accomplished. Though I'd say it was 10/90 like/hate. The film's story had no cohesive structure. It was more like multiple, unrelated subplots hewn together like a kindergarten level collage.

The Last Jedi breaks everything we know as a trilogy... and that's perfect. You just have no ideia of what to expect, because actually, everything can happen at anytime, and things really does happen. Director Rian Johnson knows what make a Star Wars movie and a great sci-fi epic, setting the bars pretty high for this one visually, technically and narratively, not just making it a love letter for the real fans, but putting it up there with The Empire Strikes Back in a kind of surprising manner, while also setting it apart from his older ""trilogy brother"" by the inventively corageous plot, the gorgeous presentation and the mind-blowing twists.",Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,Star Wars: The Last Jedi - Movie Reviews

The lack of world building is prevalent The most idealistic person in the galaxy was turned into a cynical and brooding hermit. The fact that the true escape plan is kept from Poe Damaren is infuriating. They kill off Snoke and Captain Phasma before any arc can be established. Their main character is so utterly forgettable. Instead of exploring Finn's background they turn him into a bumbling idiot. He could of been a scarred anti-hero with a dark past. By attempting to subvert the viewer's expectations the film makers subverted all the fun right out of the movie.

Also, the Holdo maneuver would have been more effective at the beginning of the chase, thus saving the rest of the vessels of the resistance. Also, where is the rest of the New Republic military.

Here are my reasons: - Memorable and well developed characters. - An original and well-executed story. - A soundtrack that was only surpassed! like photography, it's the best! The original essence of the first movies is back! and the CGI is great! It is very well worked, you can see the dedication with which it was made. - Finally, we cannot forget that we will open the doors for what is to come in 2022 in Jurassic World: Dominion!

509,huyqiwd s,"Jun 24, 2021",Okay this movie sucks. I'll start with everything I hate. The movie is really cheap and it starts off with with claire wanting to save the dinosaurs even though they should be extinct. She cries about it. The trailers are also annyoing they just showed every single good part of the movie to make you think it is going to be good. They showed all of jeff goldblums performance and they try to shove in so many dinosaurs. It has an allosaurus a carnotorus a baryonyx a synoceratops and of course they are going to make rexy kill off the bad guy at the end. It is too predictable but perhaps the worst thing about this movie is they keep copying the other ones and they do that to much. It is basically the lost world but in a more modern way. The plot twist about the clone girl is stupid the characters are stupid and all while this is going you have bad acting unnecessary scenes and overall a horrible plot. The first scene is the only good scene in the whole movie. I think the worst actor of all is bryce dallas howard chris pratt was okay I don't know why he is so good with this role but so bad when he plays stare lord in the mcu. Speaking of marvel the jurassic world movies have so many actors that have been in marvel movies for example chris pratt bryce dallas howard ty simpkons vincent d'nofrio sam neil jeff goldblum jake johnson but that's not really there fault.

This is hands down one of the best musicals Disney has created. This starts with the amazing work of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez who were the song composers for this film and Christophe Beck who was the score composer. The score wonderfully sets the backdrop and the songs are all memorable and work so well with the themes and character arcs. The casting is also perfect as all the main character voice actors have experience performing on Broadway. The work on the animation is also well done with great particle effects for the snow and noticeable improvements on human hair. I understand the oversaturation of this film in pop culture, however I fully believe it is well deserved.

The first part was released in 2013 and made a splash. 3 Speaking of the plot, it is quite heavy even for an adult, because even my parents were touched by the plot. The drawing itself is at a height, everything is very clear and every detail is drawn, which pleases the eyes. One of the most important things is that even though it is a cartoon, but all the emotions are perfectly conveyed and touch the soul. Thanks again to the smallest details, you can very well understand each character, well, except for Prince Hans( my most hated character). Of course, the cartoon has a sequel, this is its second part, but the first one will always remain in my heart. Although, I don't mind the third part) so ""Frozen"" is the best animated film I've ever seen.

It really differs from your average Disney movie as it isn't based on ""true love kiss"" and ""boys"" and ""I need a prince to rule."" The characters are hilarious and make you smile. But if you are watching with kids you will probably be hearing ""Let it go!"" for weeks on end. Even as a teenager now, my little sister puts it on and I sit with her and actually enjoy most of it.

570,Dale R,"Nov 15, 2021","A live action remake of the 1991 animated film of the same name. There are some big names in this film: Emma Watson as Belle, Dan Stevens as Beast, Luke Evans as Gaston, Josh Gad as LeFou, Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, Ian McKellen as Cogsworth, etc. They all do a great job with what they are given, except for the music. With the exception of ""Gaston"", all the songs in this film feel unemotional and over processed. Some of this, I feel, is due to the fact that there is limited musical theater experience with the actors chosen for this film. Ewan McGreagor is good, but he can't hold a candle (pun intended) to Jerry Orbach's many years of musical acting experience. The CGI for the Beast's face was lacking and I'm sure it hid a great facial performance from Stevens. There were a couple of scenes where Watson felt like a stick saying, or singing, lines. The added material didn't feel necessary to the story, though some of the plot holes from the original film were plugged. Nostalgia fueled the success of this film and maybe that will be enough for you to enjoy it as well.",Beauty and the Beast,Beauty and the Beast - Movie Reviews

589,Urainia S,"Jun 07, 2021","I really love the moral behind ""Beauty and the Beast"", and it's the only Disney romance which still gets me. It's an important lesson about the ideas behind the curse of Beauty. In my mythological soup, this stands for The Judgment of Paris, where Aphrodite was chosen as the fairest (Athena DID NOT like this) because of her ability to provide a beautiful wife for the shepherd prince. The Beast becomes a Beast in mind because he has objectified his kingdom through beauty. Beast is a stand-in for Mercury, and/or Dionysus, and that's why the beautiful Athena-like witch shows up in ugly drag to test his hospitality. When he turns the witch away based on exterior appearances, not recognizing the beauty of her wisdom, she curses his kingdom to be physical objects until Beauty reappears. Then it's up to Beauty to reverse the curse through her wisdom, by seeing past the objectification of the Beast as a horrible animal to locked up in a mansion with his material things. It's important here that Belle is the hero. The Beast can't fix himself, he's the victim, and only someone who reads books and doesn't just stare at the covers can put it all together before the rose loses her last petal...",Beauty and the Beast,Beauty and the Beast - Movie Reviews

Best parts of the movie were indeed the raccoon, Jack-Jack, and scenes with Edna Mode. During the latter parts of the movie, I literally just wanted it to end. Three years (2015-2018) of waiting for this movie, walked out extremely disappointed. Watched it for the second time last night, no, just an absolute no. I understand the animation was smoother. But certain scenes were ""cut"" too sharply. The ending of Edna Mode's scene was abrupt, cant quite describe it. If you watch it at that point, you'll understand. So sad. There was so much potential.

627,Jacob R,"Jul 03, 2021","Ok, so this movie is pretty good, and has all the good stuff from the original movie, but it has a few too many problems that prevent it from being as good as the first movie. First, all the things that I thought were basically spectacular. All the stuff that involves them actually being superheros is really good, not better then what was in the first, but still really good. Next is the animation, which feels very different then all the others. This feels like it's stylized for the 1950s, which the film takes place. Some people can find that distracting, but I didn't. Also, all the new characters are either good or funny, except for one thing, but I'll save that for a little later. Now, let's talk about all the things that this movie just didn't do well enough in, which keeps it from being as good as the original. The main thing is really the characters that are brought back. Except for Elastagirl, Frozone, and Jack-Jack, all the old characters feel significant weaker. I don't want to say this, but the worse character in this movie by far is Mr Incredible. He is either acting completely crazy, completely mean or ignorant, or is not really blaming himself for everything that is going wrong with the family. I'm sorry, that's a huge problem that you can't fix with just one scene. Violet and Dash seem weaker too, but I was able to look past them. I, however, cannot look past Mr Incredible. Also, another big problem is the stupid twist villain. I know Pixar has done them before, but only one of them was actually bad (Miles Axelrod from Cars 2 ring a bell for anyone?). That is…until the Screenslaver shows up. This was the first time I was able actually to predict the twist villain in a Pixar movie, which made it super boring. It's also really hard when the last villain in this franchise, Syndrome, is the best Pixar villain ever. So, with all of that said, I still think this a good film that everyone should watch. All the superhero stuff (besides the villain), is still spectacular, you're just gonna have to sit through a bunch of the family stuff that isn't as strong. I think that's the biggest difference between this movie and the original. ""The Incredibles"" is a family and character study first, and a superhero movie second. ""Incredibles 2"", however, is a superhero film first, and a family film second. If you don't mind the change, then you'll think this movie is great! If not, like me, you'll only think the movie is pretty good, almost great. But hey, why listen to me? Go to Disney+ and watch this almost ""Incredible"" movie!",Incredibles 2,Incredibles 2 - Movie Reviews

But anyway, that's just a minor inconvenience. I hope that's the only problem I have with this movie, other than probably the fact that it's nowhere as memorable as the first movie. While The Incredibles is something of a pop culture icon this movie is, well, let's just say we'd have never learnt about it if it wasn't advertised so much. Incredibles 2 starts off from the part where the prequel left. And it finally answers the question of what happened in the fight between the Parr family and the Moleman - It... Happened. The only thing that came out of it was that Violet's BF learnt about her identity, which was later wiped out (or so I remember, I don't even think this movie was memorable enough. I'm remembering all the scenes as I'm writing this). So now Helen is out on another adventure, leaving Bob with the kids. And he's terrible at handling them. It was a very funny scene, seeing him struggle everyday trying to help Dash with his homework and Jack Jack in changing his diapers. The family moves into a new home which is way better than their previous one. Dash and Violet discover Bob's car and they bring it home. Then something something Helen finds out the guy who she's working with has a sister who is her costume designer, and she's secretly evil. And now it's up to the kids to save the day with all the superpowers and plot armours. See this is exactly the problem of this movie. It is super predictable, although that's not a bad thing since the way those scenes are executed make it very satisfactory to watch. The animation of this movie is probably the best thing about it. It is one of the only things which has improved drastically since the first movie. The Incredibles, you might remember, was very cool. But I just wrote a review of it yesterday and it was then that I realised the quality of that movie has aged terribly. In terms of polygon count this one takes the win. However, I also mentioned in that review that the thing which makes The Incredibles so much fun to watch is that it feels like a videogame, something similar to Sonic the Hedgehog or Spider-Man for PS4. That's not something I could say about this movie. Incredibles 2 isn't one of the movies Pixar is known for making. It's something of a sequel that can only satisfy you that the fight in the end of the first movie didn't end on a suspenseful note. It is a one-time watch for the fans of the first movie, although the kids might like it since the movie seemed to be more oriented towards them.",Incredibles 2,Incredibles 2 - Movie Reviews
632,Jerry S,"Jun 17, 2021","(SPOILERS) Honestly I am almost tempted to say I like Incredibles 2 better that the original. The characters are great as always and there is some real character development the music is spot on and I really enjoyed the moments between Bob and his kids and the awesome action sequences between Helen her self. I honestly have a blast watching this sequel, however the only problem that I have with this movie is the villain Evilen Deavor. On the one hand her character is really great. She and her brother Winston Deavor have interesting and intense back stories and have good moments with each other, however the movie kinda drags just a tad because there really trying to hide the fact that one of them is the main villain. Another thing is that Evilen's plan can kinda get confusing at times. However that doesn't mean that it takes away from the movie itself though. There is this seen with the Screen Slayer a villain that Evilen herself created and has some of coolest moments in the movie. However going into that seen though there are flashing lights so you have been warned. That scene was pretty thrilling and even haunting. However the best action scene in the entire movie was the opening which was just straight awesome and so satisfying.

Of course it's not the original but it took a well known story and added onto it perfectly. I enjoy how it focused on Elastagirl and really showed how before becoming a house wife she was a force to be reckoned with. I think the villain was very unique and there was a good twist added in.

659,Jean L,"Jul 09, 2021","The Fate of the Furious continues the downhill spiral of mediocrity that is the fast and furious franchise. Once a fairly ok but fun series of movies about street racing and fighting organized crime has now become a multi million dollar franchise about extraordinary heist crime action that defies the laws of physics, stupid characters, plot devices that make no sense, and just simple stupidity. Previous movies are fun enough to watch including this one but it does not make it good. In this one Dominic Toretto played by Vin Diesel betrays his team of street racers turned into international crime fighters with nice cars. The story is completely ludicrous although it tries to make some sense but in the end is just dumb. The villain played by Charlize Teron is badass and formidable as Teron brings her incredible presence that she carries into every movie yet the character motives are questionable and flat out cartoony. The only fun thing here is The Rocks and Jason Stahams chemistry which is hilarious and great which led to the spin off Hobbs and Shaw. Otherwise the rest is a bunch of explosions and impossible action pieces in a movie universe that is supposed to be realistic and is now trying to mimic superhero movies. This franchise is losing steam.",The Fate of the Furious,The Fate of the Furious - Movie Reviews

That's the dumbest thing to have in a FF movie. Rewatch this before seeing F9 tomorrow. Not gonna bother talking about the story, cliche dialogues, villain that only say stuff slowly and slam the keyboard, or family stuff, because that is just a vehicle for the movie to exist, so that they can lay waste to as many cars as possible. It is important that after watching too many movies, you just gotta turn your brain off and enjoy a dumb movie. And the later installments of this franchise is just what I need. Watching so many cars getting destroyed and blown up was crazy fun. The best scene was for sure the remote car control scene. It was ridiculous in all the entertaining way. Dwayne as Hobbs and Jason as Shaw were great as usual. I like both of them, and Dwayne displaying his alpha body was just great.

The first part of the movie was enjoyable and fun, but Gary Gray tends to drag it a little too much towards the end. It is obvious what was gonna happen and, honestly, I expected more fireworks and CGI magic.

I watched the extended edition of this film, which in my opinion was perfect (you can rent it for the same price on Amazon). The humor and action were really good in this movie, and I loved some of the twists and turns in this movie. While it could've been generic, as suggested by some of the trailers, this movie constantly stays unique IMO. While it is VERY over-the-top, it didn't feel nearly as stupid (in a bad way) as the last one.

Paul Walker's absence is felt throughout, but thankfully this isn't a major plot point and doesn't hold the film back from having fun. I appreciated that the writers took this film in a slightly (really very slightly) different direction by having some betrayal within the group. Dwayne Johnson finally feels utilized in this entry with far more screen time and humor than in predecessors. The physics in this one are outrageously unbelievable as always, but the stunts and set pieces are impressive. I was hesitant about Shaw's redemption arc at first, but it proved to be quite satisfying and effective.

Some people complain Tony is not in a suit enough and sure, but isn't that kind of the point?

703,Nathan D,"Sep 05, 2021","Iron Man 3 was such a joy to watch as there were so many great moments throughout the film. The script is solid and doesn't shy away from any aspects, which leads to a great viewing experience. The main villain of the movie is rooted, and his motives are clear. Is he the best villain? No, but he gets the job done. The character arcs in this film are so much better here than in the second installment. Tony grew as a person and was able to become a better person overall. If I had to nitpick the script, I think I would have toned down the political tones a bit. It began to be a lot at times which I think was unnecessary. Another thing was that it felt a bit predictable at times. Using the shady businessman for the third time in a row does get a bit repetitive. Shane Black does a stellar job directing this installment and is on par with Favreau's work on the first film. There were plenty of scenes that felt inventive and unique, making the film have very few dull moments. Even with the more serious scenes, it still had the emotion it needed to be entertaining. To accompany Black's directing is some solid cinematography from John Toll. There are a lot of shots that look very nice and have some significant elements to them. Sadly, those two aspects get brought down by the harsh editing in the film. The action sequences have too many cuts leaving the scenes to feel rushed and messy. There are even a few scenes where some cuts don't match up with the shot before. The score does make up for this as it keeps the energy up in some of the scenes. Composer Brian Tyler created this bombastic score that impacted the film profoundly. The production and set design are also very attractively done. Many visually appealing locations complimented Shane Black's vision quite nicely. The cast also does a fabulous job here with stand-outs all around. Like always, Robert Downey Jr. shines on screen. This performance is the most human he has felt in any of the three Iron Man movies as he and Black translated what was on the script to the screen very nicely. Gwyneth Paltrow continues to do great in the role of Pepper Potts. Although, her performance in Iron Man 2 is still the best out of the three movies. Ben Kingsley is outstanding here and created a lot of entertaining moments in the film. I can see why some people do not like his performance, but I thought he was a lot of fun. Guy Pearce is also a solid addition to the cast. His acting seems bland at times, and it does not help that his character is somewhat the same as the other two films in the franchise. Supporting cast members like Ty Simpkins, Rebecca Hall, and Don Cheadle are fantastic in the movie. Overall, Iron Man 3 is an action-packed blockbuster that is so enjoyable to watch. The film does have a few blemishes in the script and editing department. Yet, the entertainment factor helps hide it at times. An exceptional cast, an outstanding score, and marvelous directing make Iron Man 3 a stand-out film in Marvel's cinema catalog.

The villain is generic and forgettable, and the twist is rather insulting, especially to hardcore fans. The suit that makes Iron Man who he is comes off nigh-indestructible in every other Marvel film, now the thing just flies to pieces if he gets hit just a little too hard? And he spends less than a quarter of the movie in it. Wow, how inspiring. I get that they were trying to go for 'Iron Man is the MAN, not the armour', but it just falls apart.

709,Ethan T,"Aug 25, 2021","Iron Man 3 is an average popcorn superhero film saved by Downey Jr. in the lead role. His smarmy yet lovable Iron Man is always a sight to behold. The action alternates between a decent showcase of big-budget CGI and illogical messiness. Paltrow and Downey work well together and Don Cheadle and Paul Bettany (voice) seem to have fun. Simpkins is a rare likable child star, but the positives end there for the supporting cast. Guy Pearce brings all of the campiness and not much else for a villain. Ben Kingsley is very welcome in another villainous role but does little to justify his inclusion apart from a bit of hit and miss comic relief. The comic relief in general does not completely miss, but could be stronger and telegraphs much of its humour in advance. Rebecca Hall did alright, though it's another case of her not quite bedding into admittedly daft proceedings as with Transcendence.

But, someone did make a good point about Marvel making all of the villains in witty comedy pieces. It happened with Loki in ""Loki"" and ""Thor Ragnarok"", Zemo in ""The Falcon and The Winter Soldier"" and The Mandarine in ""Iron Man 3"". It isn't really the best ideas to make people who tried to kill everyone on the Earth best friends with the main characters. Robert Downey Jr. always puts out his best as Tony Stark. The Ironman franchise is one of my favorite trilogies in cinema history. I'm sad his story is over, but I am so happy about his character arc throughout the MCU.

732,Christian K,"Aug 19, 2021","Honestly it's difficult to choose which is the most deranged film I've seen this week, Being John Malkovich or Minions. Minions does feature a 'hypno-hat' which enables the wearer to hypnotise whoever is in front of them and take control of what they're doing. So there is a slight link between the two films there. I've only seen the first two Despicable Me films (2010/2013) and they're pretty decent; nothing groundbreaking but a nice idea played out well. Minions is arguably the most inevitable spin off movie in film history, and unsurprisingly there's a sequel due next year. The sensible route seemed to be using the film to tell a minion origin story, and the opening sequence that explains the minions route through the earth's timeline is good fun, telling us how they've always wanted to serve some terrible evil master. We know where the film will probably end, and sure enough, it does, but it's produced well enough to hold the attention span of children and adults alike, even pre-schoolers will preoccupied for ninety minutes (mine certainly was). It's also absolutely bonkers, and I think to make this work the producers had to double down on the madness (or double up if you will) which is exactly what they have done. A lot of it is set in London, and there's plenty of shots of people drinking tea, as well as an extended cameo from an animated Queen Elizabeth II. But I understand that this description might not sound anywhere near as insane as a Charlie Kauffman film.",Minions,Minions - Movie Reviews
733,Puroo R,"Aug 09, 2021","I had watched Despicable Me just to understand the memes and to get within the lines of the pop culture. I never understood the deal with the Facebook memes which have pictures of Minions in them and have quotes written next to them. So I used to think Minions always speak out funny one liners for the audience to have a quick laugh at. After watching Despicable Me I realised this was nothing but cheap publicity, but then I decided to watch the whole franchise anyway, and so here we are. After having watched the original trilogy, this one feels a step back, but that doesn't mean it isn't entertaining enough. Minions is a spin-off to the Despicable Me franchise (the name of the franchise is Despicable Me or Minions, I will never know). This tells the story of how the Minions found Gru and became his, well, minions. In the beginning the Minions were only wild animals who used to serve whoever was evil. They move on from one master to another, until they have none left. And that's when three Minions set out on an adventure - Bob, Kevin and Stuart (isn't it funny that they have English names even though they were born before humans existed?). The franchise has a really good animation style. It looks cute enough to be memorable, especially seeing the Minions take part in activities in the things they see for the first time. Even the action scenes of these movies are incredible. Scarlet Overkill being shown as a total badass and then getting her comeuppance made this movie so much fun to watch. Queen Elizabeth's mockery was also very funny, especially the part where one of the Minions tries to pull the sword out of the stone. The ending with Gru was also very unexpected and gave the movie a happy (?) ending. What this movie lacks in, however, is the storytelling. This is not a good movie, but rather a good ""enough"" movie. There's nothing in this which you haven't seen before. The plot is mostly predictable, many parts are very annoying to watch, especially Scarlet being a generic female villain who always wins with martial arts. Other than Queen Elizabeth and Herb there weren't any memorable characters. Herb was memorable and still I forgot his name. Minions is one of those movies I can imagine kids going crazy over, since the movie is targeted only for them. If you're an adult you will find this movie very childish. It's not like the Despicable Me trilogy which is fun for the whole family. It has just selected all the things which made the franchise marketable and went all out in showing them here, namely, Minions.",Minions,Minions - Movie Reviews

There are non-meaningful fights, like Bucky vs Black Panther, or even the airport scene in this film. But the final fight here between Cap & Iron Man is a meaningful fight—and simply sad, especially as Baron Zemo watches from a distance with pleasure. I'd much rather see villains fight against each other (Doctor Doom vs Magneto vs Ultron vs Loki vs Thanos vs Carnage, anyone?). What was cool was introducing Spider-Man and Black Panther, and going deeper into Vision & Wanda's relationship. The plot was generally fine (even if you were semi-familiar with the comics version of the plot) but the circumstances causing the final fight seemed contrived.

I really enjoyed this in Age of Ultron, and to SOME degree here, but the talking here seems artificial to promote the highlight of this film where each side poses before fighting the other side. The disagreement over the Sokovia Accords seemed just dumb, and both Tony and Steve seemed like they were on the flip side of where they should be. Really? Tony is going to not go save someone when a bureaucrat in Belgium tells him not to? I get character growth and guilt and all, but please.

That makes the movie almost impartial, which was a super-intelligent idea because everybody could be a villain. The action sequences are spectacular and the introduction to new characters added to the development of existent and returning ones are perfect. Tom Holland (Peter Parker/Spider-Man) and Chadwick Boseman (King T'Challa/Black Panther) are two of the best characters of this universe.

Pretty great cast with Patrick Wilson, Amber Heard, Dolph Lundgren, Willem Dafoe and Nicole Kidman. Probably ranks up there with Black Panther for most colourful movies.

Though the acting isn't great by any means, and the story is kind of generic, Aquaman is selling what is literally says on the tin; a bro-ish superhero, with fish-powers, must save the World from his evil brother, whose powers are similar to his. Aquaman isn't my favourite character by far in the cinematic universe, but he does stay true to his portrayal in the comics, unkempt and brooding with a few quips here and there. I liked him far more in a solo film than I did in Justice League, as it seemed too many of the team had similar attributes and he just didn't stand out. Black Manta, being one of my favourite comic book villains, was also excellently portrayed by Yahya Abdul-Manteen II. Aquaman works better than the previous films because it doesn't need a lot of exposition and time to get to the root of the story.",Aquaman,Aquaman - Movie Reviews

Luscious visuals, incredible special effects world, great supporting cast including Oscar winners Kidman and Defoe with many stellar performances. Biggest drawback was the female lead did not have the chops to keep up with Momoa nor the chemistry to hold the position of female lead and love interest! She was barely tolerable and that God-awful red wig... At least director Wan did not have her use a hideous British accent like in the Snyder cut of Justice League. Her poor acting and general vibe left a bad taste in otherwise great movies. But I digress, this is an Aquaman review. Aquaman is an over the top character that is bigger than life. Momoa takes a character that was made fun of for many years and makes him cool. He makes this superhero someone you want to hang out with, without needing to use his powers. Wan did a nice job showing Curry's early life and showed how he became the person we are following now. Long live Aquaman!

845,Cailan D,"Aug 06, 2021","Aquaman is one of my favorite films from James Wan and shows that the director is capable of handling multiple genres. Aquaman may not be the best movie we've seen in the DCEU, but it's by far the most fun and entertaining and has the most rewatch value. The visuals are phenomenal, the fight sequences are fantastic and the premise is pretty good too. The acting supplements all this really well; all the big actors do great jobs with their roles and Jason Momoa is a surprisingly good casting choice for Arthur Curry. This movie is a solid origin story for Aquaman that I only wish we'd had before the Justice League disaster so we could've had context for character upon seeing him in a big group setting, although the movie does play off of Curry's appearance in Justice League nicely. Patrick Wilson is a very welcome face in this movie for me and fans of the Insidious and Conjuring franchises and marks his 5th collaboration (I believe) with Wan. Wilson shows how good of an actor he is in this movie. I appreciate how this movie made good use of all it's big-name and A-list actors; it didn't squander any of them and gave an actor we haven't seen too much of before the film the spotlight a few times. I do wanna reiterate a point I made earlier now about the movie being fun. Aquaman struck a very different tone and mood than pretty much every other film in the DCEU; the other movies have been very serious or comedic, but haven't been so in ways that make them truly entertaining. Aquaman has a very different vibe from the rest of the DCEU, and it's a breath of fresh air. Aquaman wants to be a fun movie and succeeds in doing so, and it's a movie I could watch 5 or more times and still be entertained by, a luxury I don't personally have with any other film in the DCEU. All that said, Aquaman isn't a perfect movie, and it's biggest fault for me is the dialogue. It's really cheesy, cringey and corny at times and without the great performances from the actors some scenes would be really awkward, stupid and unwatchable. Some the actors, especially Patrick Wilson, have to be on their A-game to keep a straight face while they say their lines due to how ridiculous the dialogue is at times. Honestly, if the dialogue had been better, this movie probably would've been a perfect 10 for me since everything else about the movie works really well; the dialogue is something I hope they work on and refine in the sequel, which according to Wan started filming recently. Overall, Aquaman may not be perfect or the best movie in the DCEU but it's a fun, entertaining and action-packed movie and has some of the best rewatch value of the whole DCEU.",Aquaman,Aquaman - Movie Reviews

The infamous Minas Tirith battle scene, the heroics at the Black Gate, Arogorn's speech, the brotherhood between Legolas and Gimli, the corruption of Frodo by the Ring... it's just cinematic perfection and there may never be a movie series to rival LOTR, particularly not in the fantasy genre.

It adapts by far the worst source material of the three and really pays the price for it with one of the worst cases of deus ex machina in movie history (the ghosts); the director thankfully chose to excise the worst chapter of writing Tolkien ever produced, that being the Hobbits returning to the Shire to find that Saruman has taken it over, but a lot of the buildup to Frodo's eventual character-ruining refusal to destroy the ring was internal and wasn't conveyed in the movie. We are instead left with a protagonist (who had already become worthless halfway through the second movie) making a heel turn long after all respect for him had been lost. I think a few of the Oscar wins this received was based on accrued appreciation for the trilogy as a whole and a lack of significant competition in '03.

884,Puroo R,"Jun 22, 2021","This is my third and final review of the trilogy. In the first movie's review I called it an RPG game and mentioned on how the world building was done adn how great the visuals were. In the second review I said it was like watching a book come to life and talked about the character development and philosophy/message the movie gave. In this third review I have called it an art and here I will talk about the story and why it will be remembered not just as a masterpiece, but also as a legacy. Keep in mind that all the reviews have been written separately but all of them imply to all three movies. The Lord of the Rings is one long story that has been divided equally among three movies. Because of this there is virtually no major difference between the them, and all the three movies have received almost the same ratings. Normally in trilogies the stories do not directly pick up from where the last one left but rather these are three different stories, because of which it is possible to have two great movies and one movie which does not live up to them (Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, Christopher Nolan's Batman, the original Star Wars trilogy, Godfather etc), or there is one great movie while the other two don't live up to that (Zack Snyder's Superman, Star Wars prequel and sequel trilogies, Jurassic Park etc). Here the risk was much bigger. Since there is just one story, either the entire trilogy would have been good or the entire trilogy would have been bad. This is why the movies were so long. The story is set in a fantasy world and not everyone has read the original books by JRR Tolkien. So Peter Jackson had to elaborate every minor detail. There should have been no questions left. The audience should've had a clear idea of what they were watching. Normally such things are only possible in TV shows which are book adaptations like Game of Thrones or The Man in the High Castle since they have enough time in their hands to explain everything. This, however, was a movie series. This is the reason why the runtime is so long. The total runtime of the trilogy is 10+ hours, and 12+ hours if you watch the extended cut. Another major problem that could have plagued this movie, if it wasn't addressed, was the number of characters and the fact that all of them were in different places doing different things. There were some minor characters right in the beginning of the story and some in the middle. All of them had to be humanised, something which is possible only if we get to know more about them. Because of this the story is moved forward such that we are made to care about all of the people. While we ask what happened to Gimli and Legolas in the battle, we are also worried that Frodo has been tricked by Gollum and is about to be eaten by a giant spider. The direction does not shift in the bias of any of the characters, otherwise the ones the audience cares about would have been left behind. People often make fun of the half-hour long epilogue shown in the end of The Return of the King, but imagine if it was not there. So many characters would have received vague endings. This was meant to assure that all the good characters got good endings and the bad guys got bad endings. I'd also take a moment to talk about Gimli and Legolas' relation. In the beginning they both hated each other but later on they grow to become friends. This is another great message that the movie sends us. In my previous review of philosophy I didn't mention it because it was seen in this movie. It talks about how we hate some people based on their appearance, their beliefs, their way of life. But we end up becoming friends with those same people once we actually interact with them. People were never meant to hate each other. This is something we are taught to do. This is also seen when Aragorn unleases the Army of the Dead. They never wanted to work with the living because of their hatred, but when one of them came forward and made the request, they gave in. It is these small moments that show the humanity in all the characters. And finally, what makes it a legacy? Today everyone knows about The Lord of the Rings. Gandalf is the first thing someone imagines when they hear the word ""wizard"", in spite of there being a more popular book adaptation movie franchise which is literally about wizards. So many RPG games have their stories set in the manner of ""some characters with different abilities go out on a dangerous yet exotic adventure"". Elijah Wood has become world famous for his role as Frodo Baggins. Gollum, in spite of being the same annoying character found in all fantasy movies, is more popular than Jar Jar or Dobby. All of this is possible because of the way the story unfolds. Everyone who was evil was simply so because of the circumstances, and those who were good were because of how much the story emphasised on their actions. This coupled with great direction and a good world building made it so popular. The Lord of the Rings is one of the era defining movies of our times. It looks like a painting brought to life, one that we used to look at in fairy tales and nursery rhymes. It is the first thing that comes to someone's mind when they think of a fantasy adventure set in the medieval era. The patience of the creators and the fans is what made this trilogy so powerful. I really hope we get to see more such adaptations of books that we haven't heard about. This one has made a benchmark that will be hard to reach in the near future unless a miracle happens.",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - Movie Reviews
885,Big Mojo W,"Jun 09, 2021","Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is the best ending imaginable to this incredible trilogy. The characters continue to shine, most notably Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf and Aragorn in this movie. With the Battle of Helm's Deep won and Saruman dead, the stage is set for the final battle in this epic saga. Upon finding that Sauron plans to strike the city of Minas Tirith, the heart of Gondor, Gandalf and Pippin ride to the city only to find Denethor, a madman in control of the city who is totally unfit to be the Steward. Eventually, the forces of Gondor, Rohan, Eriador and Mordor all coincide at Minas Tirith for the largest and in my opinion, best battle not only in this saga, but in all of cinematic history. Every scene in this movie holds weight to it, it is my favourite in the trilogy and seeing Aragorn finally take his place becoming King of the Reunited Kingdom always brings a tear to my black heart. This movie, like every other in the trilogy is flawless and I will rewatch these movies until the day I die.",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - Movie Reviews
886,Will C,"Jun 06, 2021",(Extended edition) I've always found this the weakest of the trilogy and it is also by far the worst of the extended editions. This suffers much more than The Two Towers from pointless additional scenes that add nothing to the film other than to bog down an already exceptionally long runtime. There's very few additions that I think make the film any better.

I had certain expectations and I suppose Homecoming helped me know what to expect from its sequel. With that in mind I really had a good time with this film. Its a fun small neighborhood film with a really good villain. They nailed Mysterio in the film. I loved how they portrayed his character and I loved his costume. I was surprised just how close they got to the comics with it. I am glad the days of trying to subdue or gritt-ify superhero costumes are somewhat over (still holding out for Wolverine to get his comic book costume). Ideas of certain superheroes are kind of goofy and so are the costumes. It's part of the fun. Certainly adapt so it doesn't look super goofy but don't destroy either. Overall I would recommend giving it a watch. Holland still isn't my ideal Spiderman, nor is his world, but I enjoy it for what it is. And I am so glad they got rid of Spiderman's AI voice.

The humor is still good enough, the action is done well, and Holland continues to play his role marvelously.

901,Felix L,"Nov 16, 2021","I have a lot to say. I am a huge Spider Fan a Huge MCU fan. The number of people that know Peter Secret identity is Outrageously high so it doesn't feel like watching a spider man story. The Whole Teenage movie Recipe Cliché. The Character Dialogue try to copy the one from the early marvel Iron man movie.. and fail because they have nothing to say to each other. The Teacher is the best part of the movie. The pitch meeting for this movie should have been very differently .. You think Peter can go back to a normal life after the event of Infinity War.. I know marvel wants to Elongate the story but darn it felt wrong. You know from the beginning who Misterio is.. So nothing is a surprise .. Kinda dum that Sony want to make a Misterio movie since sooo long. He's really not an interesting character. At least he was well played. Again to many love scene and goofy scene. We will we ever have a spider man movie without love scene that never ends ..i rather watch a 45 minute movie that is good than 2h movie that just pointless boring story with multiple plot hole just to insert character that you really don't care about. Fake Fury team look like the Nebucad Nezar team from Matrix and they are super Cringe .. Movie is dull make no sense . Do you really think the Skrull can be this Dum. Its like if Peter did not learn anything from all his adventure in the past few years. He has 0 sense of responsibility . Homecoming was the best Spiderman movie.. why did it turn this way Why did Peter gave Edith to Misterio ,,, And the END with J Jonas Alex Jones Jameson is simply ridiculous it made me lost all interest in the continuity because we all know what comes next.. Just like in the Infinity Saga (2012-13) in the comics. that will keep going on with dr strange / Happy Plus Aunt may = Cringe I seem to be alone to think that this was a bad representation of who Peter Parker is. But i own 9000+ comic book and I'm not living in USA so what do i know This is my least favorite MCU movie and i am serious. I gave one star for acting and cast because it was a good cast . and another star for the score BGM and FX.

917,Rafael R,"Oct 30, 2021","Compared to this movie, Spider-Man: Homecoming is on another level. Far From Home is in general a decent film, but the two most important parts are bad-written: the protagonist and the villain. Tom Holland's Peter Parker involuted, becoming an idiot teenager who wants to run away from his responsibilities to conquer the girl he likes. Where is the guy who wants to prove himself? The guy who wants to be more than the neighbourhood friend? And Mysterio's plan and motivations don't make any sense. Luckily, he's imposing and Jake Gyllenhall is a stunning actor. The humour is more basic and less intelligent, but almost as efficient as Homecoming. And what elevates the level of this film is the third act, which is for sure one of the best acts in the whole MCU. The visual effects are amazing (by the way, the movie plays with them smartly) and the final fight is MCU's best individual fight (only one hero against the villain). Tom Holland and Zendaya's romance may seem forced, but it makes sense, they have chemistry and fortunately, the script kept MJ's cynical personality. No other character but Peter has been distorted.

979,Stefan Z,"Nov 11, 2021","Ah yes The Dark Knight one that turns into Home Alone. It's got a sprinkle of mission impossible too, but it's more known for being The Dark Knight that turns into Home Alone. All the The Dark Knight stuff are great. I am a huge Batman fan and absolutely hate Joker especially his oversaturation in the DC universe, but in this he actually works as the main villain. The score, directing, and cinematography are all fantastic. Deakins did unnecessarily use yellow more than need, but fantastic otherwise. It's when the film turns into Home Alone that I have trouble suspending my disbelief. Silva exposed all double-0 agents, but 007 because he was presumed dead, But MI6 have only 9 field agents? Where are the single-0s? If there were ever a time bond would NEED to work with someone else it would at the Skyfall property. Some snipers in the off distance trees, some in the house, another in the DB5 (that unfortunately was destroyed... again. I hate when movies think it's ok to destroy timeless cars). Some other times in other Bond movies I think ""maybe this would have been better with another double-0 by his side, perhaps not"". In this one I'm thinking ""bring in the cavalry"". Yes, I get it, they can't trust anyone especially how M's bodyguard of 15 years tried to kill her in Quantum of Solace, but then why trust Bond? He was presumed dead for how long, not know how much he's changed or feels betrayed still about her practically shooting him and doesn't know how much Silva's word affected him AND even acknowledges how little she knows if Bond is being influenced by Silva by abruptly feeling the need to stop and explain her actions involving Silva. I am also not really a fan of the film constantly asking the audience if the franchise is relevant, particularly M's scenes in the courts. Every single EON productions James Bond film, all 25 of them, have made money, even with new actors in the protagonist role where customers are not used to the new shoes yet, those sometimes make even more than the last one of the previous actor. Skyfall itself grossed over a billion dollars in 2012. So to answer the redundant question, yes, it's relevant. There also are some weird plot holes involving Silva. How exactly did he know the train was going to come through the wall when it did or how did he plan to kill M years in advance when the hearing was only set up 3 days beforehand. However, this and Casino Royale (2006) are the only Bond films where James gets character development, so that is a plus. I'm torn. Not a fan of those to particular writing things, the Home Alone part being a bigger deal for me really, but man, even though I spent like a sentence or two on the positives, they do really boost up the overall quality. The cold open, the fight against the sniper in the skyscraper, and the subway (tube) foot chase are some of the best action set pieces in Hollywood history. The tense gripping atmosphere of the mystery behind who is is hacking in MI6 before the villain is revealed is absolutely expert filmmaking. I do really think the positives outweigh the negatives here.",Skyfall,Skyfall - Movie Reviews

993,Nathan D,"Oct 10, 2021","Skyfall is an incredible movie with many astonishing aspects that make this film feel like a genuine spy thriller. Sam Mendes does a magnificent job directing this movie, as he creates this obscure yet exciting tone throughout the whole screen duration. The solid script helps support Mendes' vision with a prominent central story. Skyfall nailed down the story perfectly, as this is the first Daniel Craig Bond movie to feel like the world of a spy. Both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace struggled to capture the elements of a James Bond. However, the screenwriters perfected it here in this movie. Having the central storyline being an attack on MI6 while mixing in some of the personal elements of the characters is excellent for this franchise. Where the script falls flat was the misuse of the Bond girl. The poor treatment of Sévérine is very noticeable throughout the film and makes Skyfall suffer significantly. It is not necessarily wrong to not have a Bond girl, but to have one and completely butcher her character arc is wrong. Skyfall is visually stunning, with the exquisite cinematography stealing the spotlight at times. Roger Deakins does an extraordinary job here as the director of photography. Many shots were remarkable and captured the worldbuilding exquisitely. The editing is also the most potent of the first three installments. There are a few scenes with slightly choppy editing, but it is not as detrimental as the first two films. The score is also very compelling as it elevates a lot of the scenes. Thomas Newman knows how and when to make the music match sonically with what is on screen. The cast of Skyfall is strong, with a lot of great performances all around. Daniel Craig is smooth and has a lot of fun quips that make this movie special. While he may be exceptional in the role, his performance in Casino Royale edges his performance here just by a bit. Javier Bardem is phenomenal in this film and had the best performance out of everyone. The emotion Bardem put into creating Silva was comprehensive, and Bardem never overacts in any of his scenes. Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw are both prominent in their respective roles. They each stand out in all the sequences their characters are present in. Lastly, there is Judi Dench, who knocks it out of the park. It is Dench's most excellent performance in all the Bond films, as we really get to spend time with the character and not just see her tell people to eliminate the enemies. Dench still keeps that aspect alive in her performance, as it is an influential aspect of M's character arc. However, it never becomes too over-the-top. Skyfall is the complete embodiment of James Bond as the film holds every aspect a spy thriller needs to be a great film. The story is easy to follow yet has this slight complexity to it that still makes it shocking. The cast is perfect, with no bad actors bringing down the film. What does bring down the film is a messy subplot that looms its gloomy shadow over the film. If it were not for that terrible treatment of Sévérine, the film would have been perfect.

She was charming and fun. I loved them both in Knives Out. It appeared Craig was enjoying this segment as much as I. I personally don't think any Bond movie should end like this and I actually regretted watching this outing.

1005,Lequisha S,"Oct 05, 2021","The Dark Knight of the Craig Bond films. Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins offer by far the best cinematography for a Bond film. You like that shot of the burning city in 1917? They got you covered with Bond's family estate. You like that shot in Shang-Chi of them fighting against the backdrop of neon advertisement billboard? They got you covered. Like the meditative wide shots of the landscapes in 2049? Oh do they have you covered in Macau. Like Adele? Covered. This film challenges Bond in a way no other film has. He's weary, battered, and no longer as fit for superspy espionage as he was in his earlier years. But the one woman who has been a constant in his hectic life, his boss and surrogate mother figure, and the person who gave the ""take-the-shot"" order than made Bond end up in the drink, Judi Dench's M is at risk. The best bond villain to date, Javier Bardem's Anderson Silva, is not trying to take over the world. He's got a personal vendetta against the one person Bond has any real attachment to. What's more, he's a dark mirror to Bond. A former 00 and M's previous favorite, Silva was the Bond before Bond who also suffered from ""mother's"" decision to prioritize the mission over the agent. He's not only a formidable foe for Bond, but he's an effective foil. This is also the best fusion of the modern, gritty, grounded Bond and the gadget-laden, seductive, classy elements of early Bond. It pays homage to hallmarks of the olden days (Moneypenny, Q, etc.) yet breaks new ground (we visit Bond's home, we change M's, etc.) This is truly prestige bond.

Skyfall brings the stakes higher as everything seems to be collapsing hence the title. In here Daniel Craig continues to shine as James Bond and here is directly paired with Judy Dench as M as M16 is attacked by a powerful villain. The chemistry between the two is wonderful almost as a mother and son relationship and Craig faces his most challenging antagonist until this point Silva played by academy award winner and spanish actor Javier Bardem. Bardem kills this performance and brings a similar aurora to that he brought to No Country for Old Men. Bardem is psychotic, mild mannered, and out for revenge in one of his most iconic roles. Lots of great action here as always but is the drama between the characters and the great relationship between M and Bond that makes this movie so incredible to watch with a climax that keeps on the edge. With Adele singing in the intro, great direction by Mendez, a great script, and an incredible performance by Javier this movie is almost a masterpiece.",Skyfall,Skyfall - Movie Reviews

1020,Puroo R,"Aug 08, 2021","Looking at the poster and trailer of this movie I was thinking this might be something really good. I had recently watched the first three movies of this franchise and I really liked the whole concept of Transformers; just seeing them do something on the big screen is enough to get my attention. So when I heard that this is the worst movie of the franchise, the robot dinosaur poster refused to let me believe that. How can a movie with such a good CGI possibly be bad? And when I watched it... I now apologise to all those people I didn't trust. I'm really sorry. The problem with this movie is that it has humans. I know, Transformers are all about Autobots and humans interacting and coming together to beat Decepticons, but the humans in this movie are terrible. I forgave Dark of the Moon since it was Sam Witwicky, the same guy we had previously seen in two prequels. But this time, it's the new guy. I don't even remember his name, so let's just call him Mark Wahlberg. Mark is such a two dimensional character. He loves mechanical engineering and hates anyone approaching his daughter. Yes, that's his entire personality. So when Optimus Prime ends up coming to his lab, they bond together. The premise of this movie is all wrong. The Autobots are now considered criminal in this world because of the destruction that happened in the previous movie. Like, what? Dude, even the army was doing destruction in the previous movie if that's supposed to be a real reason. Also everyone saw the Autobots fight the Decepticons in the epic climax moment. And it's not like there's some communication gap between the Autobots and the humans, since Optimus Prime literally lived with the military. So if there's any problem at all, they can just talk about it. So anyway Optimus helps Mark, his daughter and her boyfriend escape from there, and they team up with Hound and some other Transformers (I don't even remember the names at this point, because they don't give a reason to do so). Together they go to The Lost World where Optimus fights the robot T-Rex for which I watched this movie in the first place. First of all, the T-Rex is like, five times bigger than Optimus Prime. For comparison, just try fighting an elephant with your bare hands (except that elephants are herbivores and won't attack you unprovoked). And after the beating that T-Rex becomes friends with Optimus because it's a Michael Bay movie. So then there's the epic showdown battle between Mark and some bad guys. I was doing my college project on my laptop and this movie was running on my phone's Prime Video, so I used to only look at the movie whenever something interesting would be happening, otherwise I'd just keep doing my work. I don't think I looked at the screen more than 3-4 times throughout the work. This is the reason why I can guarantee you that it's a boring movie. I don't remember most of it. Transformers: Age of Extinction is the movie that taught me that Transformers could be bad too. Earlier I used to see Screen Rant articles which said that after a time the movies went repetitive with the CGI fighting and explosions, so I didn't understand what's bad about it since that's literally what I watch them for. But it turns out the reason why I hate it is the other way round. The big, cool robots have now turned into parodies of themselves and the humans are no longer even close to being interesting. I'd say if you haven't begun watching this franchise, just watch the first three and then jump straight to Bumblebee. That would save a lot of time and inner peace.",Transformers: Age of Extinction,Transformers: Age of Extinction - Movie Reviews

The new Transformers are fun as well, whether it be the snarky Crosshairs, the serious Drift, or the violence loving Hound. This movie is a new start, and a good one at that.

The score once again is very amazing. It makes a good moment into a nearly perfect moment. The story is not complicated and if anything its too basic. The action like every Transformers movie is GREAT. It also is probably the most kid friendly Transformers movie out of all of them. This or TLK. The humans aside from Cade are pretty bland and just, ""Eh."" Lockdown is great though. He might be better than Megatron. He is very powerful and pretty cool looking. Some of the shots in this movie are insane. But another problem is how long this movie is. I feel like it could have been done in a one hour and forty five minutes movie. Like every other Transformers movie its pretty stupid. The dinobots were pretty cool. but they could have come sooner. Lockdowns ship is very cool. Crosshairs, Drift, and Hound are all ok additions to the cast. They kill off an important Transformer in the beginning which sucked. It helps show how powerful Lockdown is though. This movie is like a cake. You eat it and it tastes pretty good. You think to yourself that you would it the cake again in like half a year. You do and it tastes just as good.

1060,Jeff B,"Oct 29, 2021","Jeff Barnes 8/28/21 The Dark Knight Rises Review The Dark Knight Rises enables you to be absorbed while watching it with: symbolism advising you to pay attention, intrigue, a moral that teaches us persistence. Batman in The Dark Knight Rises plans to save Gotham City from a terrorist named Bane with the help of Catwoman. Catwoman is perhaps the most captivating character in the picture. Catwoman is a thief, but she believes she's being a thief for a good reason. She tells Bruce Wayne that she, like Robin Hood, steals from the rich to give to the poor. She is so full of mystery we wonder why does she feel like she must steal to get what she wants? I's probably because she enjoys being sneaky and manipulative. She does it because she sees a lot of fun in it. Catwoman believes you should take what you see because you only live once, and that you should seize the moment. Catwoman is an insecure woman who's not sure if she wants good or evil in the world. There is a scene in the film where Catwoman a/k/a Selina Kyle sees a picture of a family and realizes that the place that has been demolished and spoiled was someone's home, and her friend Holly says ""now it's everyone's home. This is what you wanted a storm is coming."" Selina then looks dismayed and unassured as if she seems to be comprehending that maybe evil isn't as pleasant as it seems. One of the most powerful moments in The Dark Knight Rises if not the most powerful moment is when there are an army of policeman running towards an army of criminals shooting at each other, and this represents a war between law and crime. The Dark Knight Rises like the previous Christopher Nolan Batman films has a main theme and it's persistence. The occasions that most notably represent persistence is when Bruce Wayne is thrown in exile when he's thrown into a pit where men suffer, and he's determined to get out. Wayne realizes that climbing out of the pit takes persistence because he figures out that only one person made it out. He also grasps that he and Batman have a whole lot of endurance as well more than you can imagine. He's still willing to climb out of the pit despite only one person having done it successfully. Before Wayne successfully climbs out of the hole, he sees Bats coming out of the walls and this symbolizes that he truly is Batman. The film that shows that Batman is willing to have so much persistence that he's willing to be selfless by risking his life to save others at the end. Christopher Nolan brings a satisfying conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy with: persistence, theme, morals, symbolism, and intrigue.",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews

1069,ggavwva a,"Sep 30, 2021","Sep 21, 2021 This review contains spoilers. the filmmaking in The Dark Knight Rises is nothing short of masterful, and stands above the other two in the franchise, especially from a cinematography, production design, and art direction standpoint. Not to say ‘Begins' and especially ‘Knight' were lacking, because they were crafted to astoundment, but ‘Rises' just took it a step further, especially with the sound, and the fact that it didn't get nominated for either sound mixing or editing is a straight up insult to the film, and goes to show The Academy was only concerned with the politics of the shooting that year rather than the merit of the actual film, which was fantastical. On a technical level, it's **** amazing. It deserved a cinematography, production design, SCORE, sound editing, and sound mixing, and visual effects nomination and there's no **** denying that. The production design and art direction were more layered and complex than the past few films. The cinematography did seem a bit more modest than ‘Knight"" but it still succeeded at giving us some haunting and memorable images and composition that really fit the more somber and hopeless tone of the film, instead of the fiery orange and blues that bolded the presence of chaos in ‘Knight"". The score may have taken track basis' from Begins, but it restated them and added much more variety and emotional power and timing to the film. The sound design isn't even an argument, and while the visual effects were actually pretty minimal for the part of a lot of them being practical, that still should've given it enough to grasp a nomination over ugly bland CGI **** like The Avengers and that Hunstman movie. I mean come **** on, those two movies have some of the ugliest color palettes and uninspired VFX I've ever seen. In a less competitive year, it easily could have gained a supporting actor nomination for Michael Caine, because he added a whole extra layer of emotional depth to the film with his performance, and boy he really got it out in those few scenes. it gave me a feeling I haven't really felt in any other movie, bringing tears to my eye. And no, he wasn't not in it enough. Check Hal Holbrook for Into the Wild. He was in that movie for a very short time, but gave enough of a performance to get a nomination. Same type of deal. With very similar roles, actually. Despite being the best, most relevant, and most well made film of the year, and even one of the best of the decade, Adapted Screenplay, Picture, and Director were extremely unfavorable for the simple fact that the Academy can't see past ""Batman"" and because it wasn't getting anything more than its predecessor did. I can go on and on and analyze all the relevant and subtle political themes and philosophical depth that is beautifully mixed in with honest and emotionally resonating heroism, postmodern ambivalence, and themes of pain, corruption, and personal crisis and struggle, but it's not that important to this topic. People are too busy nitpicking **** that doesn't even matter (and can easily be debunked) anyway. The fact of the matter to this question is that it was ungratefully and unreasonably snubbed from the technical categories simply for the fact of the Aurora shooting. There is no other answer. The Academy didn't want to glorify a film that ""represented"" such a tragedy. The Dark Knight Rises is one of the most gritty and beautiful films ever made, and from a technical standpoint, it is one of the absolute greatest next to its predecessor. It deserved at least 2 or 3 nominations for sure at the very least. **** the Academy for putting politics over actual filmmaking merit.

The movie is exemplary in its use of editing and sound, they complement each sequence in the film perfectly and set the atmosphere for the film. Tom Hardy is almost unrecognisable as Bane. I believe it was a great performance. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman is a complete scene stealer and the dynamic scenes between Christian Bale's Batman and her Catwoman are well done.

1075,Hhhh V,"Sep 01, 2021","Where to begin. It starts out with an absolute bang. Another movie to the trilogy, another extremely badass, villain of the century introduced. Bane is intimidating, ruthless, badass, a myth; everything a great villain should be: pure evil. We immediately are hooked to the story that continues unraveling through the next parts of the movie. We get to see yet another deep and dark interpretation of Bruce Wayne/The Batman. Once again, Christopher Nolan flawlessly executes the complexity of the character and gives us so much more than just that. We see Wayne using his fears, his pain, his suffering to overcome those very things and rise above. We see our beloved Alfred giving his all to what can only be described as his father-son relationship with Bruce. We see new characters appear for the first time, such as the talented burglar, Catwoman, who also gets a very deep character and personality behind the mask. We get to see a mere cop, who gives his city his all, and risks his very life for the great good, representing a symbol of pure goodness. Not a single moment throughout this movie that makes you feel bored or not entertained. It's filled with amazing CGI; next level story-telling; suspense to keep you at your toes; character development that makes you connect to them in a way you never have before. You can literally feel the pain Bruce is going through, you can literally feel his journey to overcoming it.

1077,Janjz Z,"Aug 29, 2021","Aug 21, 2021 i just rewatched this film for the first time in a few years and boy was it much better than i remembered. this film offers a new look at gotham compared to the dark, gritty criminal underworld present in the first two films. we can see a gotham that has prospered in the last few years, moving out of the darkness both figuratively and literally. most of the scenes in this movie are set in broad daylight, which is a refreshing change from the last two entries. tom hardy is excellent as Bane in this movie. he is the first villain in this series that truly feels like an unstoppable force. the moment where the whole plan comes together, the cops are trapped underground and bane declares anarchy on the football field was chilling and was the first time i felt as though there were real stakes from a villain. i do find miranda tate being the true villain an excellent twist. she is Bruce's reckoning, a cultivation of everything he has done and him quite literally facing his past dealings with the league of shadows and the consequences of his never ending work to protect gotham. i do wish they'd built up her relationship with bruce a bit more, though, as their romance did seem to come out of nowhere, but in the end it made the twist even more jaw dropping. this movie is long, and there is a LOT going on, but for the most part the pacing is pretty good. there were definitely parts that could've been cut out, this film suffers from agonisingly long and boring car chases like the dark knight does. other than that there isn't much i would change about this movie. anne hathaway is also spectacular in this movie and was very enjoyable to watch. i found myself enjoying every scene she was in and we get to see her grow from the selfish to the selfless across the movie. this movie also features great performances all round. out of the main ensemble i can't say there are any weak performances. my favourite scenes would have to be the ones of bruce in the pit. he is quite literally reborn there and the harrowing chants of the prisoners as someone attempts to climb is something that i always remembered from the first time i watched this movie. this movie excels at being the end of the trilogy - batman's final mission. with the highest stakes ever, and one of the most impressive villains i have ever seen in a superhero movie, it's an enjoyment to watch from start to finish. And in the final scene where we see the plane fly off with the bomb and batman inside it we are quite literally seeing the death of batman. bruce may still be alive but he has hung up the cape, and the batman died along with the bomb leaving a beautiful well-wrapped ending to one of the best trilogies of all time. i don't see much point making more batman movies after these ones, they are hard to flaw are greatly celebrated even today. afflecks batman wasnt great, but he still feels like he stands in the shadow of Bale, which i also worry will happen to Pattinson once ""The Batman"" releases. after rewatching the remarkable ending to a franchise it has got me thinking about how future movies can compete, and in my opinions batman should be left to rest for now. the dark knight rises is the perfect fulfilling ending to batman and his story",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews
1078,Vghh H,"Aug 26, 2021","Aug 21, 2021 Not only is this the most intelligent Nolan film, really getting you to work as you watch the villain's plan unfold before you and the heroes, but it is also the most powerful in storytelling and moving the audience. Already you have the groundwork laid out from the previous film 'The Dark Knight' to follow up with Batman, running from the police who now has to tackle a new threat. It could not be done in a more mind-shattering and brilliant way. Bane's character, while seemingly a bit generic, quickly makes you realize how much you've taken him for granted when learning more about his backstory. Every time he walks on the screen he has a presence. I would say the same for the Joker, but he's been unfortunately memed too much for me to take him 'so serious' anymore. The way in which Bruce must rise again from the pit truly felt inspiring, and how he climbed out without the rope, the safety which he had always throughout the previous films. To me, that rope was symbolic of everyone he had with him throughout the films. Alfred, Rachel, and Dent as well. Now he had lost them all to the very same symbol which he crawls back to every night. He still finds the courage to put it on one last time. This time especially, I felt extremely interested in all other subplots in the movie. Gone was the fun but slightly stale 2000s grain and the lower mm cameras. This really plays up the aesthetic which Gotham is, and also allows for Gotham City to feel breathed in, as though people are really walking through it. This is something I never truly feel in any other Batman series or adaptation. To say this is the best Batman movie is an understatement. This really is the peak of Nolan's filmmaking for me. Everything from the acting, choreography, the score, and much more is such a step up from both predecessors. It never ceases to amaze me how much effort must have gone into this film.

This is going to be like a combo of my review of the movie and just my general thoughts on the trilogy as a whole but in both regards it deserves nothing but the highest praise. Such a brilliant display of everything from audio-visual work to narrative structure and characterization this trilogy really does it all. The score was absolutely outstanding from beginning to end and in this movie I felt like the score did so much to amplify all of the scenes regardless of what was happening. The dialogue was amazing, iconic one liners and more subtle conversations that carry so much emotional weight it doesnt feel like a single line is wasted at any point which is extremely difficult to do. The cast is so well done, can we just talk about how this one trilogy has some of the best protagonists antagonists and side characters in all of fiction? Every character arc was explored and developed to its fullest from beginning to the end, characters that are introduced in one movie get the proper amount of development necessary to flesh out every aspect and ultimately creates some of the most iconic performances in all of media. This movie had that in spades, in particular it had a lot of really good development for Commissioner Gordon who was already one of my favorite characters in the trilogy but this cemented it for me. My favorite character in this movie in particular was Catwoman for sure, she served as a super interesting counterbalance for Batman acting as sort of a more self-serving out for herself version of him and god damn was it fun to watch. Amazing performance Anne Hathaway absolutely killed it, its honestly kinda nuts how well she fit the role imo. Bane was another really interesting character, had some great dialogue, and his characterization was really well done. I think one of the main themes of this trilogy is the idea of chaos and how it brings out the worst in people, and Bane is a fantastic device used to explore this idea. I think The Joker was the better device through which this was explored but like I think thats being a little bit unfair so its whatever, both are fantastic in their own rights. Also this ending might be one of the best most conclusive most satisfying endings to anything that I have ever watched or read, everything fit perfectly into place, I just wanted to see my boy Bruce happy and thats exactly what we got, the ending had me straight up crying it was so good. I came to become so invested in these characters over the course of these movies and it feels so good to see this trilogy end in such a beautiful way. This trilogy is absolutely goated in every way, shape and form, Christopher Nolan is a genius.,I'm not even mad that we didn't get any more it's absolutely perfect. Truly one of the best universes in all of media, I honestly don't even know what else to say other than the fact that its brilliant The Dark Knight Rises: 9.5/10 Goated, absolutely fucking goated. This is going to be like a combo of my review of the movie and just my general thoughts on the trilogy as a whole but in both regards it deserves nothing but the highest praise. Such a brilliant display of everything from audio-visual work to narrative structure and characterization this trilogy really does it all. The score was absolutely outstanding from beginning to end and in this movie I felt like the score did so much to amplify all of the scenes regardless of what was happening. The dialogue was amazing, iconic one liners and more subtle conversations that carry so much emotional weight it doesnt feel like a single line is wasted at any point which is extremely difficult to do. The cast is so well done, can we just talk about how this one trilogy has some of the best protagonists antagonists and side characters in all of fiction? Every character arc was explored and developed to its fullest from beginning to the end, characters that are introduced in one movie get the proper amount of development necessary to flesh out every aspect and ultimately creates some of the most iconic performances in all of media.

1083,Jim T,"Aug 18, 2021","There's a lot of good in this film still. But it has neither as strong of a plot as Batman Begins or the stupendous fun of the Dark Knight. The climax is well done, but leaves unanswered still the question of whether Gotham can truly be saved, undermining the final product. Batman rides off into the sunset, but it is unclear that he has actually changed the city much for good - it still appears that it is only the same small group of individuals in the city who care for the city's character - not what Bruce Wayne took the mantle of Batman to do. Sure, he beats the bad guys in this battle, but he leaves the war while it's still being fought.

1086,Vhbg H,"Aug 13, 2021","Aug 9, 2021 Now this is how you close off an epic trilogy successfully! The Dark Knight Rises is the third and concluding chapter to Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, and is what I consider to be, a grand fitting end to the Christian Bale Batman/Bruce Wayne story arc. Released in 2012 to tremendous box office and critical reception, The Dark Knight Rises managed to become the highest grossing Batman film of all time, surpassing the hefty financial gain of The Dark Knight (2008), and still bares that title to this day. The Dark Knight Rises also has a few criticisms drawn from fans and critics alike, despite its mainly universal appraisal. Luckily for me, I'm not one of these hateful naysayers that hold any vice against this film. Drawing inspiration from various Batman comics storylines, such as ""Knightfall,"" ""No Man's Land,"" and ""The Dark Knight Returns,"" The Dark Knight Rises manages to convey an engaging and effectively entertaining plot that's jampacked with numerous allusions, homages, colossal themes, and most importantly, a gratifying and emotionally powerful conclusion. Christopher Nolan really outdid himself with this production. Not only do we get a phenomenal plot, but we get phenomenal choreographed action sequences and intense visuals. The special effects alone are a treat to the eyes!! Christian Bale is remarkable in his final performance as Bruce Wayne, bringing us a battle-hardened, broken hero who must rise past his broken spirit (and broken physical limitations thanks to Bane and previous fights) in order to save Gotham City from total nuclear destruction. Familiar faces aiding him such as characters portrayed by Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman bring their A-game in their final roles also. Newcomer Joseph Gordon Levitt does great as cop John Blake. And Marion Cotillard delivers an alluring, mystifying dual-identity role as Miranda Tate/Talia Al Ghul. But it's fellow newcomers Tom Hardy and Anne Hathaway that really stand out. The Bane we get in this movie is a lot different than the remedial one we get in Batman And Robin (1997); this new one portrayed greatly by Tom Hardy feels almost ripped straight from the comic books: an intelligent mountain of a man, who poses as both a physical and intellectual threat to Batman. Behind Heath Ledgers groundbreaking performance of The Joker, he's my favorite Batman villain in Nolan's trilogy. Anne Hathaway portrays Selina Kyle/Catwoman, a professional cat burglar, grifter, and femme fatale who develops a relationship with Bruce Wayne/Batman. She manages to evoke the sense of who Catwoman really is, and does such a great performance, she rivals Michelle Pfeifer's take on the character in Tim Burton's Batman Returns (1992). Lest we forget the intricate and meticulously well-shot 70mm IMAX cinematography? Or Han Zimmer's delightfully haunting musical score? Or every sliver of a detail perfectly synchronised to make connection and reference to the entire trilogy as a whole? No, lest us not forget. I still choose The Dark Knight as my favorite of Nolan's brilliant Dark Knight Trilogy, as well as my favorite comic book adapted film of all time; but The Dark Knight Rises will blow you away regardless",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews

The symbolism of the ending ends the trilogy off perfectly.",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews
1089,Ghhh b,"Aug 09, 2021","The dark moral of a corrupt political climate that The Dark Knight Rises shows through Gotham's grief is really excellent when the perspective is put on the issue. With Bane's ever lasting commitment to pulling off pain in the city, and Miranda's morality with her revenge it sets off a never ending stream for the tone of the film to follow along. Then Bruce wanting to be his own nation ""per say"" and do it without the willingness of others around him. Focusing on the complexities of the film is what I loved during this rewatch. Half of the dark blend of Nolan's direction and the surrounding technicals are what send this film off another level. With each of his films he keeps that dark tone and hits a nerve on the edge of your seat with every picture he makes. With each shot he focuses his time on making it make sense and capturing the message and/or symbolism of the scene. I don't really talk about it that much because it never turned to conversation but honestly the greatest scene in this film is the Star Spangled Banner Scene. The symbolism of that is so impressive. Your honestly watching one of the most messed up scenes in the history of Cinema. By using that song in the angelic voice of that young child symboled the freedom Gotham felt, but we as an audience no good and well it's not. And the feel of the scene is so damn intense. I always notice that it's only the kid singing, noticing that nothing else is happening except the anthem of freedom being used as the last thing to be heard before that feeling of freedom is stripped away entirely. Bane then going on to say ""that's a lovely, lovely voice"" knowing good and well he's about to kill that symbol of freedom singing the anthem of freedom. After that scene the third act takes off and the film gets nothing but brilliant. The technical blend as well deals with the more explosive side of visual effects. They go so well with the film it's hard to take your eyes off. The character of Bane has to be the best part about this film. Not only is he so **** misused in other DC properties and gets his rightful spotlight, but Tom Hardy's ability to make such an evil character and use that flow of darkness that Bane is so viscously proves that Christopher Nolan can be a director to take risk, and that arc of doing all of this for Miranda was pretty much a great twist. And I'd just say I recognize the hate that Miranda gets for her twist of being the head mastermind and not Bane, but I honestly think that the writers so greatly used their minds to convincingly show why she was the one behind it. Overall, The Dark Knight Rises should go in the all time books, and be shown as a way to tell a unique perspective on political corruption.",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews
1090,Jsnna S,"Aug 05, 2021","The casting is still great. The gravitas of Oldman Caine and Freeman just add so much weight and levity to characters which could not have been anything special. Tom Hardy is excellent as Bane and I love the way they shoot scenes to make Hardy seem larger then he actually is. He is almost the representation of pure evil and is the definition of intimidating. His famous 'I will break you' line from Batman Knightfall in 1993 has lived on to one of my favourite comic series and I love the soft adaptation that it gets. Selina Kyle contributed to some of my development in this movie in the same way that Carrie Fisher as slave Leia contributed too many children's development. Marion Cotillard is good as Tate but probably the weakest actor as she gets really cheesy towards the end. It's ironic as she is one of the better actors as a whole but doesn't always bring it for this movie. The most underrated performance though comes at the hand of the main actor and Bale knocks it out of the park again. Probably his best performance in any of these movies. The action is easily the best in any of the Dark Knight trilogy. Its funny ironically however as it means that Catwoman has some of the best action. The jewel in the crown though is Batman vs Bane in the sewers which is so cool. Speaking of which this is one of those extremely quotable movies due to Bane. My favourite is easily 'oh you think darkness is your ally, but you merely adopted the dark. I was born in it Moulded by it, I didn't see the light until I was a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding'. This all combines to make one of my favourite scenes when Batman escapes the pit and as a detail I love the bats coming out just before he jumps. Very rich plot. Its my favourite type of plot as if you are barely focusing on it you still get everything that happens but if you really focus you pick up every minute detail and I love those sorts of plots so much. The cameos also really surprise me as I didn't expect Scarecrow to rock up the first time I watched it. It's also miraculously well directed. Nolans over the city shots alongside his practical work, work wonders to create a realistic but also extravagant movie. His cinematography is also fantastic. It also continues the trend in his films to sometimes not have a concrete ending and in my opinion that works better. 10/10 I have no faults.",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews

1095,haley W,4d ago,"The film, the Joker, is about Arthur Fleck. For a living, Arthur works as a clown who deals with mental illness. He lives in Gotham City with his elderly mother and must take care of her. Arthur is constantly mistreated by society which is present throughout the film. When his social worker tells him he won't be able to get his medication anymore because the government is shutting them down to save money, this creates a major impact on Author and other citizens in Gotham who deal with mental health problems. This film has caused controversy because some believe it could give people ideas of mass shootings. The movie did not motivate mass shootings. It also did very well in theaters and many people, even if they don't know anything about DC Comics, really enjoyed the film. The Joker also had a very successful box-office run and won awards. The twists and surprises in this movie make it worthwhile and will have the audience on the edge of their seats. The opening scene of the Joker sets a dark tone for the rest of the movie. It shows how society treats people like Arthur and makes the viewer feel bad for him. Joaquin Phoenix who plays Arthur, was an incredible choice for this role. Joaquin's movements, emotions, and laugh really made the viewers sympathize with him as well as really helped the Joker come to life. The card Arthur must give to those who are confused why he is laughing is significant. This was a great way to introduce Joker's iconic laugh to the audience and to the citizens of Gotham city. A significant action Arthur does in the beginning of the movie is using his fingers to make himself smile while in clown make up. The reason this is important is because he is putting on a mask to make it seem like he is happy but, on the inside, he is struggling. Later it shows Arthur in his apartment with all his medication he has to take which makes him feel like he is just going through the emotions. The first subway scene shows how Arthur is being picked on because of his mental illness by laughing in a serious situation. This causes Arthur to make a rash decision and causes an uprising. The director Todd Philips did an amazing job picking the cast members. Each scene was important to this story as it went on. The close ups and zoom-ins, like Arthur sitting on the train after getting told he will be on the Bill Murray show, show how important and make you focus on that detail. After, Arthur goes to the Arkham Asylum, one of the many important parts in the movie. In this scene Arthur realizes about his past and what his mother, Peggy, went through. This scene is also huge because mental illness is a big issue in society today and makes people realize how big of an impact it can have on people. When Arthur leaves the Arkham Asylum you begin to piece together the hallucination he had with his neighbor. This begins to make viewers question what parts were hallucinations and what parts were really happening? The music in that scene is a great choice. The soundtrack to the film all fits together and was picked very well. This film is also interesting because unlike most movies about the Joker he is always battling Batman. But in this it takes place before Batman is Batman. It gives an insight into why the Joker became a villain and shows at one point he was a member of society, following the rules of Gotham. Another scene that was created well was when Arthur starts to transform into the Joker, by dying his hair and putting on clown makeup. Another scene is when he is dancing down the staircase. This scene is powerful because he is in his suit, clown makeup, and green hair. The music for this scene pulls it all together, it was a great choice and his dancing to the music is perfect. This is also showing his transformation from Arthur into the Joker. The scene on the subway when everyone is wearing a joker mask is powerful. This helps Arthur escape from the police, and it shows people turning on the police as well. The riot in the subway helps the cause of Arthur. The slow motion of him walking away from the subway while police run into the subway shows how confident Arthur has become and how much more confident, he is becoming. When Arthur is being pulled out of the cop car by fellow rioters and is placed on the hood of the car is symbolic. This is symbolic because there are citizens of Gotham who believe Arthur is right about the way Gotham is being run, which ties into his later encounters with Bruce Wayne. When Arthur uses his own blood to put a smile on his face and the crowd cheers, is the point when Arthur is no longer in control and the Joker has now taken over. The song ‘That's Life' is a great fit for this movie, which is played a few times throughout. It represents how even though society has not been kind to Arthur or others like Author, he still persevered through it and is taking actions into his own hands. On a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the highest score, I would rate this movie a 10. This movie can relate to issues in society today and is a realistic portrayal, unlike a lot of villain movies. It was directed incredibly well, and each scene is important to understanding the character arc the main character goes through. It also brings up mental illness which is an incredibly big issue today. Although Arthur's mental illness is very extreme, it still sheds light on how impactful it is on people. The background music in all the scenes match perfectly with the characters' attitude and show the seriousness of each situation. This really helps show how Arthur transformed into Joker and even when he wasn't telling you still understood the emotions he was feeling. It also shows how little Gotham did for the poor and mentally ill citizens. Todd Philips did a great job with bringing his idea to life and making people empathize with Arthur Fleck.",Joker,Joker - Movie Reviews

إقتباس من جملة نطقها الجوكر على لسانه في فيلم The Dark Knight والتي تمزج بين الرغبة في الشعور بالشفقة تجاهه وبين تبرير أفعاله التدميرية في مدينة جوثام، أما شخصية أرثر المهرج والتي عرفت بأسم جوكر في النصف الثاني من فيلم Joker من تأليف وإخراج Todd Phillips كانت الكاشف الأول عن العالم الحقيقي للجوكر والمبرر المنطقي لخلق شخصيته في أي مكان وزمان مماثل إلى العالم الذي أجبر أرثر على محاولة العيش فيه طويلا مع والدته داخل مدينة جوثام، وذلك من خلال مشهد وراء الآخر وبسبب هذا البناء التراتبي للشخصية يمكن تفهم حالة السوداوية التي تم تحذير المُشاهد منها. فيلم لم يخلو من الجدل أحدث الفيلم ضجة قبل خروجه إلى النور بسبب العديد من الأسئلة ومنها من سيقوم بلعب دور الجوكر بدلا من الممثل ""هيث ليدجر""؟ إلى أن تم الكشف عن ذلك ومعرفة أسم الممثل وهو ""خواكين فينيكس Joaquin Phoenix"" تسبب هذا الأمر في دفع الجمهور إلى حالة من الإنتظار والترقب لما يمكن لخواكين تقديمه في مثل هذه الشخصية المعقدة خاصة وإنه ممثل له ثقل، ولكن لم تنتهي الأسئلة والحيرة عند هذا الحد وبدأت تساؤلات آخرى وهو تخص المخرج، فمخرج العمل تود فيليبس يعرف بإخراجه الأفلام الكوميدية ومنها على سبيل الأمر The Hangover بأجزاء الفيلم الثلاث وفيلم Due Date وبالطبع هم على النقيض من صورة الجوكر الدموية وطبيعة الشخصية المحفورة داخل ذاكرة المتفرج بسبب قراءة القصص المصورة ومشاهدة أفلام باتمان والجوكر، ومع ذلك لم تتوقف حالة الجدال والتخوف عند هذا الحد فعقب الإعلان الأول عنه قامت المباحث الفدرالية بتحذير جنودها FBI من حضور الفيلم لما أتسم به الإعلان من مشاهد دموية كما زعموا في تقاريرهم ، المثير في الأمر إنه بعد عرض الفيلم في مختلف دور العرض كانت ردود الأفعال شديدة الإنحياز بين محبي وكارهي الفيلم حيث لا وجود لحالة وسطية بينهم ؛ الحالة المنتشرة من الجدل هو أمر مفرح في حقيقة الأمر لأنه أبسط ما تستحقه شخصية ثرية وصعبة البناء مثل الجوكر. جوثام رحم خصب لخلق جوكر لم يسبق للمُشاهد معرفة الحياة الخاصة والنشأة الإجتماعية التي ترعرع فيها ""الجوكر"" حتى يصبح بمثل هذه العدوانية وعدم المنطقية، فكل ما سبق معرفته كان قشور سطحية عنه وعن الآذى الذي تعرض له في مدينة جوثام فقط، أما في فيلم ""جوكر Joker"" يستطيع المتفرج أن يشاهد الحياة السوداوية التي سعى آرثر للتعامل معها منذ اللحظات الآولى من الفيلم، أظهر المخرج فيليبس مدينة جوثام بأنها شوارع تفيض بالقمامة والقاذورات وذلك عن طريق حركة الكاميرا عند جانبي الشارع فضلا عن الإذاعة التي تخص أحوال البلدة بأنها مدينة ممتلئة بالقمامة والفئران، وفي هذه الأثناء كانت الألوان المستخدمة لتظهر البلدة هي ألوان غاية في السواد خافتة في إضاءتها تشعرنا بحالة من البؤس والحزن وليس الغضب والثورة، في هذه المدينة ايضا نجد حديث تلفزيوني تعمد فيه المرشح السياسي بإهانة الشعب عن طريق وصفهم بأنهم مجرد مهرجين، الصور السابقة سعت إلى تمهيد عالم ديستوبي تعمه الفوضى وهمي ليس للخير مكانا فيه حتى لا ينصدم المُشاهد من مشهد ما. تدور أحداث الفيلم حول شخصية آرثر، آرثر شاب يعمل كمهرج محدود الدخل والموهبة ايضا وسنعرف الأسباب فيما بعد، يتعرض إلى تعدي جسدي وضرب مبرح من قبل مراهقين بدون وجه حق، لكنه لم يحاول الدفاع عن نفسه وفضلا عن ذلك لم يقف الأمر عند هذا الحد بل تعرض للمضايقات والتنمر من قبل رئيسه وزملاؤه في العمل ماعدا زميله القزم، من خلال أحداث الفيلم نكتشف إصابة آرثر بمرض يدفعه إلى الضحك الهستيري المرضي الذي لا يتوقف، يبدأ آرثر في الضحك عندما يكون أمام مواقف تثير غضبه وسخريته ولكن بسبب تعارض ضحكاته مع الموقف عليه أن يستمر في جلساته العلاجية أملا في تحسن حالته. يعيش آرثر مع والدته المريضة في شقة بسيطة ومبنى متهالك ورغم كل ما سبق يبذل آرثر كل ما في وسعه من أجل سعادة والدته والعناية بها، وخلال هذه الأثناء يعطيه زميل له مسدس حتى يكون وسيلته في الدفاع عن نفسه في عالم يزداد فيه الجنون يوما بعد يوم ومع توالي الأحداث يلجأ آرثر إلى إستخدامه ولكن دون الشعور بالذنب تجاه القتلى وتتولى الخيبات أثناء أحداث الفيلم إلى أن تصبح حياته أكثر أهمية من موته الذي كان يتمناه. الشخصيات المهمشة في حياة آرثر الأمر اللافت إلى الإنتباه أن جميع شخصيات الفيلم هم شخصيات تستحق الرثاء والشفقة مع إختلاف تلك الدرجة فالسياسي نفسه يتم قتله أمام أسرته في نهاية الفيلم، النساء الذين ظهروا في حياة آرثر مهمشات في حقيقة الأمر فنجد ""والدته"" سيدة مسنة مريضة أرغمت آرثر على أن يكون لقبه هو Happy رغبة منها في أن يكون آرثر وسيلة لإضحكاك الآخرين لا لنفسه وهو الأمر الغير مفهوم فمن الطبيعي أن تسعى الأم إلى سعادة إبنها وليس إلى سعادة الآخرين عن طريق التضحية بإبنها لكن آرثر كان متقبل لرغباتها ولهذا سعى لأن يكون مهرج ولكنه بالطبع مهرج لا يضُحِك بسبب إفتقاره لمثل هذه الموهبة، خلال أحداث الفيلم ترسل الأم خطابات بصورة مستمرة إلى الرجل الذي سبقت أن عملت لديه وتظل طوال الفيلم في حالة إنتظار من أجل الحصول على رد وعن طريق الخطأ يقرأ آرثر الخطاب الآخير ليعلم أن والده هو هذا الرجل السياسي المرشح في الإنتخابات، حاول آرثر الوصول إليه ولكن عند مواجهته قام بنكر الأمر وتعنيفه مفجرا حقيقة مرض والدة آرثر العقلي ويخبره بمرض والدته العقلي وبالفعل يجد آرثر أوراق تثبت ذلك، يضع هنا المخرج المُشاهد في حيرة حقيقية ففي عالم مماثل إلى العالم الذي يعيش فيه آرثر يسهل تزييف الحقائق لأن جوثام مجتمع ديستوبي مشوه وملوث يغلب عليه الإنهيار المجتمعي والقمع السياسي مما يعطي إحتمالية زيف هذه الأوراق ولكن طريقة الحصول عليها تؤكد احتمالية صدقها، ولهذا لا توجد حقيقة مطلقة في هذا الفيلم، بل تكاد تكون الحقيقة هنا هو أنه لا يوجد حقيقة! التلاعب المتكرر في الفيلم بتنقله الدائم بين أكثر من رواية يفقد المتفرج القدرة على تصديق اي من الروايتين ولا يكون منه إلا أن يستمتع بمشاهدة الفيلم وهو قابل إلى تصديق جميع الروايات. التلاعب الآخر الذي ظهر بوضوح في الفيلم كان عن طريق شخصية ""الجارة"" وهي Single Mother تعمل على تربية ابنتها بمفردها دون اي وجود لرجل في حياتها، صاحبة بشرة سمراء ومن المسلمات في تاريخ العنصرية هو وجود أمرأة ليست متزوجة وسمراء في بلد أوروبية مما جعل وجودها في مثل هذه الهيئة الشكلية والوضع الإجتماعي هو تأكيد على التهميش الواقع عليها داخل مدينة جوثام، يحتك آرثر بها في المصعد وتنشأ بينهم علاقة رومانسية عذبة ومن خلالها تكون داعم حقيقي له والشخص الثاني بعد والدته الذي يثق في موهبته فنشاهدها مبتسمة أثناء سماعها إلى نكاته، ولكن طبيعة هذا الفيلم دائما ما تصدم المُشاهد فهي لا تعرفه! إذ فقد كانت كل المشاهد التي أتسمت بالعذوبة عبارة خيال ورغبة داخلية لدى آرثر تمنى العيش فيها، وهذا بالتحديد أمر مهم لمن يريد البحث حول دوافع الجوكر إلى القتل لأن معايشة الخيال وكأنه الواقع هو أكبر دليل على كونه شخصية مضطربة ذهنيا. كان آرثر يمتلك دوافع إنتحارية أخبر بها ""طبيبته"" بوضوح لكنها لم تلق لحديثه اي اهتمام فقد كانت تكتب له ورقة الأدوية المصرح له بتناولها والمدعومة ماليا، عندما أراد آرثر للمرة الآولي أن يتحدث بما يدور بداخله بكل صراحة إلى الطبيبة كان ردها عليه أن المجتمع لا يهتم به وبها فقد تم إيقاف التمويل لهم وسيكون على كل منهما أن يسعى في طريقه بعيدا عن الآخر، هذا الأمر الذي حدث بالفعل في عام 1981 عندما ألغى الرئيس الأميريكي رونالد ريغان قانون أنظمة الصحة العقلية لعام 1980 الذي أصدره جيمي كارتر، ما تسبب في دفع العديد من الأشخاص الذين كانوا تحت المظلة التأمينية إلى الشوارع وكأن هذا الخط الدرامي هو إسقاط وتعرية لحقيقة ما حدث قديما مما يؤكد إمكانية خلق جوكر في مثل هذه المجتمعات بسهولة. بسبب عدم وجود إشراف طبي كان من المنطقي أن تسوء حالة آرثر إلى حد الإنتحار ولكن طريقته في التعبير عن معاناته كانت في القتل والرقص والإبتسام والضحك الحقيقي لأول مرة، فعندما لجأ آرثر إلى القتل اختفت حالته المرضية التي تخص ضحكاته المضطربة اللاإرادية، وكأنها تأكيد على يقين آرثر من مقولة الفيلسوف جان بول سارتر ""الجحيم هو الآخرون"" فعن طريق القضاء عليهم تمكن من الرقص بخفة ورشاقة وأمتلك وجهة نظر في هذه الحياة. آرثر ولد طيبا لماذا لجأ آرثر إلى القتل؟ في جريمته الآولى التي لجأ فيها إلى المسدس كان لديه غرض نبيل من المضحك قول ذلك ولكنها الحقيقة، عندما شاهد آرثر مضايقة ثلاث شبان إلى فتاة داخل محطة المترو تصاعدت ضحكاته بسبب سخطه من الموقف وهنا حاولوا هم التعدي عليه، دافع عن نفسه للمرة الأولي فقتل أحدهم، كانت المرة الآولي التي يخشاه فيه أحد فقتل الثاني والثالث حينها بدأ الشعب يشيد بأفعاله ويرتدون أقنعة المهرج مثله أثناء قيامهم بالثورة، رد فعل أهالي مدينة جوثام كان التعرية الحقيقة لهذا المجتمع فجميع أفراده ليسوا سوى جوكر في إنتظار فرصة مناسبة للتكالب والثورة وإعمام الفوضى، المهمش ينتظر فرصة واحدة حقيقية من أجل إثبات نفسه حتى يعوض حالة اللامرئي الذي فرضها المجتمع عليه وهنا ليس من المنطقي أن نطلب منه أن يظهر بصورة أخلاقية بل على العكس كلما ظهر بصورة مشوهة كلما كان أوقع لطبيعته. لم يكن من الصعب الإقدام على تنفيد الجريمة الثانية وهي القتل بالوسادة، قتل آرثر والدته بسبب إكتشافه انها السبب الرئيسي في تدمير حياته بإصابته بهذا المرض المزمن من الضحك بسبب تعذيبها المميت له في صغره، آرثر لم يعش يوما واحدا سعيد في حياته، بطل تراجيدي في وضع مأساوي منذ نعومه أظافره يجبر المُشاهد على الشعور بالشفقة تجاهه ودعم عمليات العنف والقتل التي قام بها، ولهذا كانت جريمته الثالثة مرضية نفسيا للمُشاهد وهي تهشيمه رأس زميله في العمل الذى آتى إلى منزله لزيارته فهشم آرثر رأسه أمام صديقهم القزم ومما يؤكد أن قتله لمن حوله لم يكن إعتباطي وإنما لغرض إنتقامي لم يقتل القزم بل حاول طمأنته وفتح له باب الشقة حتى يذهب في سلام، وعملية القتل الآخيرة من نصيب مقدم البرامج موراي ""روبرت دي نيرو"" الذي كان يعتبره بؤرة الضوء والسعادة الوحيدة في مدينة جوثام حتى إنه كان يمهد نفسه لمقابلته ويتخيل الأمر أكثر من مرة ولكنه فوجئ بسخريته منه والحط من شأنه، فقتله هو الحل الرادع من أجل إسكات صوت الإعلام التلفزيوني المزيف فهو وجه آخر إلى السلطة التي لا تأبه بالشعب الحقيقي. جوكر وليس الجوكر كان قرار المخرج فيليبس عندما أخرج فيلم بهذا الشكل هو إغراق المُشاهد داخل عالم آرثر وليس عالم الجوكر مما جعل الفيلم منفصل ومختلف عن صورة الجوكر المخلدة في الذاكرة وفي نفس الوقت ساهم في خلق فرضية انها قد تكون الحياة الغامضة التي نشأ فيها الجوكر حتى يصل إإلى مرحلة ما قبل الوحشية الغير مبررة، والجوكر قد لا يكون آرثر بعينه بل هو كل شخص من أبناء بلدة جوثام الذي ذاق الفساد والتعفن داخلها، في هذا الفيلم نجد آرثر قد تحول إلى ""جوكر"" وليس ""الجوكر""، جوكر هو إسم قد تم إختياره بصورة عشوائية في النصف الأخير من الفيلم عندما سخر موراي من آرثر أمام المشاهدين ولم يكن يعلم اسمه فقدمه في فقرته بأسم ""جوكر"". كان الأسلوب الذي لجأ إليه آرثر عند القتل يزداد عدوانية شيئا فشيء كما ذكرت في الفقرة السابقة فمن طلق ناري إلى خنق بالوسائد إلى تهشيم رأس ثم القتل أمام جميع مشاهدي التلفاز، فقد أعترف آرثر وهو في ثوب شخصية الجوكر بقتله للثلاث شباب في برنامج موراي على الهواء مباشرة ولم يقف الأمر عند هذا الحد بل قتل المذيع نفسه الذي سخر منه، امتلك آرثر كل المقومات التي تجعل قتله تبرير منطقي فقد كانوا هم من تسببوا في الآذى الذي تعرض له فكما يقول جان جاك روسو ""الإنسان يولد طيبا، المجتمع يفسده""، لقد أفسد شعب جوثام آرثر وجوكر في نفس الوقت في السابق سخروا منه وتعمدوا تهميشه وعندما تحول إلى قاتل قاموا بتمجيده، وفي الحالتين فهو يستحق شفقة المُشاهد. منطق الجوكر في إتخاذ قراراته ليس بالضرورة ان يكون نفس المنطق لدى المُشاهد الذي يشاهد الفيلم عند إتخاذ نفس القرارات في حياته الواقعية، ولهذا كانت هناك مواقف هجومية تجاه الفيلم بأن البناء الدرامي له ضعيف وغير منطقي، في الحقيقة أن عدم منطقيته هو أحد أسباب أهميته، فالفيلم بأكمله يدور في الثمانيات عند مدينة وهمية تم إفتراضها في عالم القصص المصورة تسمى جوثام، اي انه لا ويوجد ملمس حقيقي لها على أرض الواقع رغم إشاراتها الواضحة والصريحة إلى تشابهها مع مدينة نيويورك ولهذا يكون توظيف أغنية That's Life للمغني Frank Sinatra أمر منطقي، فكل جملة داخل الأغنية تصف الحالة الشعورية لآرثر المحاصر طوال الوقت إلى أن تحول إلى رمز لدى سكان مدينة جوثام ليحقق بذلك هدفه البسيط من هذه الحياة وهو ألا يظل غير مرئي في أعين الجميع قائلا: ""أنا الآن موجود، بدأ الناس في ملاحظتي..""",Joker,Joker - Movie Reviews

There's some problems but eh. This film is what solidified this saga for me. At first the highest i rated one of the films was a 7.6 for ""Empire Strikes Back"". Granted, I was torn about my ratings from the get go, but this film is what really awakened my true feelings. Empire went from a 7.6, to a 7.9, and then after this film, an 8.7. This film barely beating it, at an 8.8/10. I mean, I know it might change later, just like it has been, but for now I feel confident enough about my ratings and reviews; which is a first, ever since I started this saga. The Star Wars Saga went from a good franchise, to being one of my fav universes/franchises in film history. It gripped the Force around me, and now I love it and the Force is with me.

1143,Chris F,"Nov 19, 2021","It's hard to even encapsulate my thoughts in words, because I'm not even sure what I witnessed. Like watching a person in a wheelchair topple down a flight of stairs, I want to do anything to help, and yet I can only sit back and watch aghast knowing that there's only suffering left. This is immensely sad it becomes comedic, in a deeply mournful way. It feels impossible to make a mockery of something with such a powerful legacy such as Star Wars. But Rise of Skywalker somehow exceeded all hopelessly low expectations to be an absolute travesty of filmmaking. I've heard that this was an attempt to reset from the mistakes made in The Last Jedi. And yet the entire runtime of the film is filled with MORE mistakes, nothing of which resolves or absolves the previous poor filmmaking, and all which only makes the situation worse than it already was. It's as if Abrams gave up before he began, attempting to juggle far more than he knew he could, dumping his entire juggling act on the floor, shrugging, and walking away even though he was paid to entertain. The first part of this film is exhausting. The nonsense jump-cutting from scene to scene at (quite literally) lightspeed is so disorienting. It was so hard to wrap my mind about even what the general plot or objectives were as it bounced between conversation and action spectacle. Only when Lando Calrissian makes an obligatory cameo that I was somehow drawn out of my drunken stupor, and realized that I was actually watching a beloved series near and dear to my heart. And then I saw that series so bastardized that it was hard not to sit back and mock the entire thing. Jedi ghosts have super powers! Rey also has healing superpowers, wowee! Is that Palpatine? What's he doing there? Look at all those sith in coliseums. Why are they there? Who knows! It's just nonsense. To think of all the controversy there was when the new trilogy was originally debuting, and the entire Star Wars canon had to be reset just to make it make sense; knowing this is where it all ended up, it's almost a joke that the lore needed to be reconstituted at all. This series stomps on everything you love and acts happy about it. And you're meant to feel joyful that everything you love has been destroyed, truly and completely. You're meant to like this.

JJ has to come back and try to fix this trilogy, an impossible task I'd say, and I'd be correct. This movie is a mess with MAJOR plotholes, and it seems like it satisfied the fans? I don't get that, maybe the positive reaction stems from the after-shock of having to watch Rian Johnson's attempt at butchering the whole franchise, but this movie seriously lacks the Star Wars charm, which George Lucas gave us with his film. The reason why The Force Awakens is held higher than the two later instalments into this sequel trilogy is because that movie has the Star Wars charm, and the nostalgic feeling and hype around watching Star Wars again got to us all. There is serious potential wasted in this sequel trilogy, JJ played it safe, Rian ruined everything, and this is the attempted clean-up... This is a sad attempt, Disney, maybe you should try to bring in a George Lucas or a Dave Filoni in a supervising role or something. Both of them know how to handle this franchise.

1196,Jacob R,"Jul 04, 2021","This is a movie, that even now I still can't really make my mind up about. Like, I enjoyed it, I'm giving it a positive review, but it's easily the weakest of the entire franchise, and I actually don't think it's that close. The biggest problem is that this isn't a ""Toy Story"" movie; it's a movie completely about Woody. Everything is around him, not the rest of the toys. Because it's the fourth film I guess they can do that, but imagine if like a seven year old went with his or her family to watch this movie. They'll like it, but are they going to remember characters like Jessie, Bullseye, and the rest of the gang like the other three films? No, they're just not. In the other three films it felt like the screen time for all the characters were perfectly balanced. In this movie, however, again, it's all about Woody. Another big thing is that the new characters are really either a hit or a miss for me. Like I love Duke Caboom, but not really that tiny officer toy thing. It's like the same thing that Toy Story 3 has, just more of a distraction, at least for me. Now, with all of that said, this is a really enjoyable movie to watch. Animation is great, I like the story enough, but what's not talked about is the setting. Putting this story in a carnival was such a smart idea, and it can lead to a lot of good ""action"" shots. So yeah, I'm recommending it, just don't expect the same impact the other films had. There was really only one scene that left a huge impact for me, and without going into spoilers, it involved Gabby Gabby, the villain. I would put on a lot more Pixar movies before this one, but I wouldn't mind taking this one out of the toy box every now and a then. Go to Disney+ and make you're own opinion on this probably ending of arguably the best animated franchise ever!",Toy Story 4,Toy Story 4 - Movie Reviews

1202,Jerry S,"Jun 15, 2021","Toy Story 4 was pretty good. The animation was top notch and the best out of all of them. The story on the other hand needed some work. I honestly think that this movie should've had a subtitle under it because this feels more like a Woody movie than a a stand alone Toy Story film. I have no problem with it being a Woody movie but the movie is called Toy Story. With this I did expect the story to be about Woody and the toys not just mostly Woody himself. Sure the new characters like Forky, Gabby Gabby, Ducky and Bunny, and Duke Kaboom were memorable and fun to watch it just would've been more entertaining with the other toys that are there. However despite the movie's flaws there's a lot that I enjoy in this one. I enjoy Woody and Bo Peep's relationship. I actually enjoyed the father figure between Woody and Forky and I also enjoyed Bonnie experiencing school for the first time. However my favorite thing about this movie is the ending. I just loved how this movie ended. I really like the idea of Woody doing what he wants for wants he really wants to be with Bo Peep and he finally gets to do that is just so satisfying. This brings so much character development from Woody and opens the door to so many possibilities to tell knew and interesting stories for the toys. So overall was Toy Story 4 perfect? No, but it does do a lot of interesting things to not only keep you engaged but to also make you feel satisfied. 9/10",Toy Story 4,Toy Story 4 - Movie Reviews

1231,Jacob R,"Jun 27, 2021","Man….did Pixar kick off this decade with a bang with another 5 out of 5 movie! The last couple of Pixar movies have been some of my personal favorites, with Cars more suiting as a guilty pleasure than anything else. However, I think Toy Story 3 is better than all of those films by a good bit. First, the story and plot. It's a prison break movie, which I'm already a sucker for. Combine that with the Already great storytelling of Pixar, and you have a chefs kiss for it! Next, the villain. Lotso is probably the best Pixar baddie since Syndrome. He has a great backstory, and for the majority of the film, he wins, which is kind of insane. Now, let's talk about the animation: it's perfect, not too much to talk about there. And the ending, OMG the ending! It's such a great way to end the movie. If I had to nic pic one thing, it's probably the plot line of making Buzz a space ranger again, that seemed a little lazy. But that means we got Spanish Buzz, the funniest part of the film, so it doesn't affect the quality of the movie at all. The question really is is this the best Toy Story film? To me at least, I like the second more, the sole reason being that I like the characters introduced in that one better than this one. Not to say the new characters are bad in anyway, but are they going to leave as big an impact as Jessie or Bullseye? Yeah, me neither. This is a great film, and a perfect way to end this franchise….too bad they made another one, but that's for another review.

I also like the idea of a prison break out of a summer camp. And I also really like how they keep on bringing memorable new characters. And the ending of the film does put you on the edge of your seat. However even though I like the ending of this movie I think it would've been better if it had a tighter good bye to Andy. I think it should've had a little bit more time to feel the emotion through Andy, Woody, and Buzz. But other than that I really enjoyed this movie.

Hamuru 8 parçaya ayırıp parçaların her birini güzelce yuvarlayın. Tezgahı ya da başka bir düz zemini bolca unlayarak hamurları tek tek açın. Tereyağını eritip hamurların üstlerine gezdirin. Hamurları dıştan içe doğru sararak rulolar yapın. Ruloları kendi etraflarında spiral olarak sarıp 10 dakika kadar dinlendirin. Dinlenen hamurları yeniden tabak büyüklüğünde açın. Tereyağını eritip içine suyu ve tuzu ekleyin. Yeniden donmaması için kısık ateşte bekletin. Hamurların her iki tarafını da yapışmaz tavada iyice pişirdikten sonra üzerine yağlı sudan sürün.

Once again the performances are great, and the characters are as great as they were in the first. However this time around, we get introduced to an even more compelling villain than Barbossa from the first film: Davy Jones. Davy Jones is the best villain the ""Pirates"" franchise has to offer. Besides Jones, another aspect of this film that I think puts it above the first is the plot.

On the complete off chance, someone stumbles upon this review who has yet to watch the movie (that's got to be one niche market haha), it's fun, action-packed, has literally the best CG villain of all time, and actually an ok plot. Honestly don't get the hate for number two, it's still got a lot of the good qualities of POTC and hasn't yet gone threes route of being a bit ott and down right messy righting wise. Zimmer's new additions to the score are also very welcome, Klaus did a fantastic job with the first movie, but honestly I think he'd gone as far as he could with creating an incredibly iconic theme. Needed Zimmers expert touch to do the more subtle love themes and breath more life than solely reusing the same old main theme again and again.

Like the first movie, the visuals, music, costume, makeup and set designs are incredibly impressive, the acting is just as good, the film is honestly funnier than the first, it's a much darker movie, the characters are just as great and have clear motivations and once again, we get amazing pirate action scenes especially with the Kraken, the Will vs Norrington vs Jack fight and I love the ending where Sparrow comes back to ‘defeat' the Kraken. Seeing Will's father was also heartwarming and Davy Jones is a great villain and is built to be an intimidating threat but it's flawed. The tribe scene (whilst hillarious) adds nothing to the plot, Beckett does nothing throughout the movie but sit in an office and I just don't find the plot as intriguing as the first movie. It's basically a treasure hunt story without the obstacles. It seems more focused on characters than telling a fun story and because the story isn't over yet, it's also not entirely satisfying but it's still a good movie but the first movie was way better.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest - Movie Reviews

This movie has the best fight scene out of all the pirates' movies. It is well choreographed and worth its 2 hour run time.

To be real, there's never gonna be a Lion King rendition that's gonna come anywhere close to the 1994 classic, let's be honest with ourselves. However for it's credit, this remake did not want to make me leave the theater in disgust. If anything it's a good movie that it's worth a watch, you just gotta dial down your expectations of the movie because some parts of it are kinda watered down and a bit of filler moments are put in there too which would explain this movie being 25 minutes longer than the original. Other than that, it does follow the script to the letter and makes for a good nostalgia high with modernized graphics. Props to the CGI team, this movie does look beautiful, probably the highest mark of the movie. It's not a bad Disney movie at all, the unfortunate part is that it does not surpass what the animated classic has already brought out to us and those are shoes that are almost impossible to fill so I can understand this movie falling short in some parts. It does make for a good comparison of what is being brought to this generation versus what my generation got as a kid growing up in the 90's.",The Lion King,The Lion King - Movie Reviews

While it's a shame that director/producer Jon Favreau added nothing new to this tale (despite proving his capabilities with 2016's vivid and fresh 'The Jungle Book') it manages to retain the soul of the original and is sufficiently entertaining. Excellent voice and vocal performances couple with stunningly life-like depictions of wild Africa and it's animal inhabitants to satisfy fans hoping to relive an old favorite, while offering new viewers an experience approximate to what the rest of us experienced in 1994, albeit with less facially emotive animals.",The Lion King,The Lion King - Movie Reviews

The CGI is the best in any ""Star Wars"" films, and the entire story feels darker though still very welcome. The action is also done very well in this, and the worldbuilding is still very spectacular. About the only bad thing I can really think about this film is that there is quite a number of instances of fan service, though I think that this film handles it better than most other films do. Jones, Luna, Mendelsohn, Yen, and Tudyk are some of the better actors that really give it their all in this film. The humor is also very well and lands a majority of the time.

1350,Yuri L,"Sep 18, 2021","One of the best Star Wars films ever made, and certainly the best one made during Disney's ownership of Lucasfilm. This movie took a risk by dispensing with the orthodox Star Wars formula by not being focused on the Skywalkers, and instead introducing a new set of main characters who all died at the end. The risk paid off. A change in pace from the normal style of Star Wars films worked well. It was nice to watch a Star Wars film without countless scenes about the force and pompous Jedi preaching. Instead we had an intertaining action film which expanded the lore of the Star Wars universe in an interesting and exciting way. The final Battle of Scarif was very well executed, with an epic space battle and a satisfying and unorthodox ending. My only issue with this film is the character of Cassian who was supposed to evoke some sort of false-equivalency between the empire and the rebellion with his stories of committing unforgivable war crimes for the rebellion. This might be a good point regarding conflicts in the real world, and it might have worked in Star Wars but it was awkwardly executed and unbelievable considering the very black and white perspective we get on good and evil in other Star Wars films.",Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,Rogue One: A Star Wars Story - Movie Reviews

I thought all the lead actors played their parts well especially Felicity Jones as Jyn Erso. I think the visuals of this form are more artistically beautiful than the Lucas films - maybe that's the strength of Disney. I also found the plot more convincing. With the original trilogy the main stars always manage to miraculously survive but in such a conflict that wouldn't generally happen. Also the discussion of the morality of war and conflict in the rebel alliance added to the more realistic feel of this film.

All of the musical numbers were done to perfection, as well as the new songs included in the film. The animation looked great, even making a big blue Genie look like he belongs in our world. The only major gripe I have with this movie is the actor who played Jafar was nowhere near as harsh and menacing as the character was in the original.

They also tried WAY too hard to be empowering to women... to the extent they got rid of anything that seemed over-objectifying and gave Jasmine a new song and other quirks that come off as offensive to people in the middle east who have gender roles as a cultural norm.

The big problem with this movie is it banks on the audience connecting and caring about what happens to all of these new characters which just isn't the case. In fact the only familiar faces&people the audience cares about were Barbossa and Jack which are still great characters and all but there was none of the buildup like in Pirates 2&3. Because by the end of the movie nothing has happen except that a few new characters that we barely got an introduction to died which has no relevance to the series. That aside however there were some great scenes with Capt. Jack and Barbossa the palace scene for example and in all is certainly not as bad of a film as Pirates 5. So in all I would say a solid 7/10 film!",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides - Movie Reviews

1447,Matthew D,"Jul 10, 2020","A return to form for this piracy centered franchise. Rob Marshall breathes life into a dead series with his swashbuckling adventure picture Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011). Borrowing heavily from the previous installments and Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade, Marshall takes us on a curious sea voyage seeking The Fountain of Youth and eternal life. Gore Verbinski's original Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy was much darker and more distinct, but Rob Marshall makes pretty well made films with a sleekness that's comforting. Johnny Depp is hilarious as the bumbling Captain Jack Sparrow, who improvises his way to victory with some clever wordplay and devious cunning. Geoffrey Rush's Captain Hector Barbossa is still fiercely entertaining with a raging vengeance sailing him towards Blackbeard. The gorgeous Penélope Cruz is cool as a sword fighting love interest for Sparrow as the voluptuous and vexing Angelica Teach. She's a wonderful addition to On Stranger Tides and adds a formidable foil element to bounce comedy, romance, and swashbuckling off of Sparrow. Ian McShane has a gravitas as Blackbeard, but I wish he got more screen time. If his crew were not focused on so much, he could have fought and killed more as Blackbeard to make him more intimidating and scary into the dread pirate Blackbeard. Kevin McNally is still steadfast and funny as first mate Joshamee Gibbs. Sam Claflin is nice and charming as priest Philip Swift. His romantic affair with the enchanting French mermaid, played by the hauntingly lovely Astrid Bergès-Frisbey, is a nice side plot for On Stranger Tides. Richard Griffiths has a hilarious cameo as King George II. Keith Richards kills it again as Jack's father Captain Teague Sparrow. He's mysterious and entertaining, while providing a serious presence in his scenes. Dame Judi Dench gets a funny quick cameo as High Society Lady. Marshall knows how to direct interesting action sequences like the double duel or the mermaid encounter with intricate timing. Marshall is also competent at directing sincere drama, but he leans too heavily here into the hectic near improvised humor. I wanted more romance drama between Captain Jack Sparrow and Angelica as well as more character development for Blackbeard. Marshall's direction is engaging and slick enough to keep me easily entertained by On Stranger Tides' 136 minutes. It's more compact than previous movies with David Brenner and Wyatt Smith's editing is more forward thinking and efficient than the bloated jump cut riddled At World's End. Hans Zimmer returns to cascade us with epic classical music for his Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides score. Heavy strings and intense percussion mark his sonic style with beautiful compositions throughout On Stranger Tides. Penny Rose's period costumes continue to amaze me with realistic pirate outfits down to the floppy hats and boots. Ve Neill's make-up is still excellent as I still like his use of black eye liner and dirty looks for all the pirates. It's not perfect with Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio rely too much on past in jokes instead of new bits, plus Blackbeard's crew being zombies is dumb and has essentially already been done in The Curse of the Black Pearl. Elliott and Rossio create a mysterious atmosphere with their intriguing writing with plenty of fun humor and lighthearted action. Dariusz Wolski's cinematography features heavenly fountain wide shots to intense mermaids attacking from dark waters with striking shots. Wolski is a creative cinematography with a stalwart style for Pirates of the Caribbean. In conclusion, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a refreshing splash of cold water to the face after the wayward and bloated At World's End.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides - Movie Reviews

1455,Puroo R,"Jul 27, 2021","I had watched Despicable Me only so that I could finally understand what the whole deal with the minions was. But I ended up liking the movie and all the characters in that. As a result I decided to watch the sequel as well, which I ended up liking even more than the first one. So I thought why not just go all out and watch every single movie? And so I watched this one, and I really I think it was not something really great, although it did manage to do what it was meant to do: give us the laughs and have a good time. Despicable Me 3 is about Gru finding out about his estranged brother Dru who is living a very rich life but does not have the evil nature of Gru and thus is not liked as much by his family. And so grew is forced to take his brother along with him to stop the evil villain Balthazar Bratt, a child actor from the 80s who has faded away with time. Although the minions in this movie are way less than the previous two I don't mind this at all. In fact I kind of found them annoying and I wanted more of the human characters than those yellow Facebook meme sources. Balthazar is my favourite villain from this franchise. All his acts are very funny. Whenever he is on the screen you know you are in for some good time. There are often callbacks to his show which is very campy and has barred CGI according to today's times, which is just like how we see shows from the 80s today. He always dances and plays songs whenever he is out on the heist. It is fun to watch Gru and Balthazar fight in the opening scene and also the way Baltasar dances as he defeats all the guards on the ship. The animation of this movie is way better than the previous two, especially when it comes to the action scenes and car chasing. What this movie lacks in however, is the amount of campiness and cliched moments of having an amateur person come out on a secret mission along with the professional friend/family member. In fact the whole idea of the protagonist having an estranged twin brother is a cliched idea which has been used many times in Bollywood films. Although this isn't a very memorable movie, it does exactly what all the other movies from this franchise do. It is able to create a fantasy world with fun and loving characters who do goofy things and we enjoy them while it lasts. And this is the reason why I don't think this franchise should have more movies. By the time one movie comes we have already forgotten what happened in the previous one. Although I wouldn't say that this is a bad movie, I would definitely say that you would not remember anything other than the good parts once the movie ends, and this is the reason why this movie is so much fun to remember since I don't exactly remember what I didn't like about it.",Despicable Me 3,Despicable Me 3 - Movie Reviews

The movie has only two major weaknesses that are easy to get past being that there is too many plots and that it relies on juvenile humor and toilet humor more than the last two. However, these are just small flaws and are easy to look past once you see the plots mesh together in a really satisfying way. This movie had some pretty good highlights, like when Gru said his mother told him that his father died of disappointment when he was born as well.

1506,Jacob R,"Jul 02, 2021","I behold to you…..the best Pixar sequel that isn't a Toy Story film! So I liked this movie a lot….and that's pretty much it. I guess I could dive into all the things they changed. For example, because Dory is now the main character, Marlin and Nemo are sidelined. I don't see that as a problem with Nemo, because that's what happened in the first film. It's more Marlin that I'm disappointed in. He became just a meaner version of his character from the original sometimes, so I started to kind of dread when he came on screen. Next, all the new characters. Except for probably Hank, I don't think I'm going to remember them the same way I remember the side characters from the original film. Oh, and just to get it out of the way, voice acting and animation is once again spectacular. The setting feels like a new breath of fresh air too, with it being an aquarium. The story is pretty simple, but besides the two 5 out of 5 Pixar films this decade so far (Toy Story 3 and Inside Out), all of them have been pretty simple stories. I guess the one big problem that I have is that Dory's flashbacks are important and nice, but a little too convenient for the plot, and by the end, way too repetitive. Speaking of the ending, it's absolutely bonkers that a fish and a septopus can drive a truck, but I kind of love how crazy it is. Oh yeah…and this film has a big emotional moment, which the original, in my opinion, does not have. This is of course being when Dory is reunited with her parents. It's a chefs kiss of an emotional scene. So, is this film better than the original? No, I don't really think it's that close to be honest. But, is this a good film that I think everyone should watch! Hell ya! It has its problems, but they in no way ruin the film, at least for me.

I thought the story was touching of how Dory was finally able to see her actual family was pretty charming and heartwarming at times. However the only issue that I have with this movie is that it does feel long like the first one and some scenes could be cut out mostly some of the scenes between Nemo and Marlin because to me they felt like they were here just because they were here in the first movie. However with that being said though the movie is actually pretty interesting. I find it nice that for Dory we're getting more on her character than the first movie and this film does do a good job of making you care about the new characters that are in this movie.

It's a nice role-reverse on the ‘Finding' premise and the voice acting is top-notch from the characters old and new alike. The new characters, by the way, are easy to warm up to and easily fit into this world. The pacing of the movie is great end-to-end, and the intentions of each character are clear which makes the story easy to follow.

The inclusion of some characters felt unnecessary to the plot, and the humor in this film is miles away from the witty humor that the previous films had. The CGI and action is a significant improvement in this film, with much more spectacle to the fights. There were some odd lines said in the movie, and I think some of the acting is extremely flawed. However, the villains are great and the vast number of Jedi introduced is not done in a way where its hard to remember the names. Overall, while the film does have its good parts, there are quite a number of bad parts when compared to the previous films and I can see why die-hard fans of the original trilogy continue to hate on this film, though I don't personally think its as bad as most people will say.",Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace - Movie Reviews

1577,Dale R,"Nov 15, 2021","This film is an amalgamation of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll with a tiny bit of the 1951 Disney film thrown into the filter of Tim Burton's direction. While I was excited to see Burton's version of Wonderland, the movie changed so much of the characters from the source material that it was not a movie about Wonderland. So much so that they changed the name of Wonderland to Underland. This film looks terrific, from the costumes Alice wears to the CGI. I also enjoy the story arc of Alice and the new character of Bayard. The rest of the characters are reduced to delivering exposition or short gags. If you would like to see a totally unique version of Lewis Carroll's works then check this movie out, otherwise skip it.",Alice in Wonderland,Alice in Wonderland - Movie Reviews
1578,Latifa P,"Oct 26, 2021",This movie was visually entertaining but that was it for me. Just a lot of the same tired old hollywood tropes. The storyline didn't really make sense and so many lines that attempted to be heartfelt made me cringe. Although it attempted to be a feminist piece the narrative is so unbelievable in terms of gender norms of the period that this fantasy take feels like a mocking joke. I guess a period piece loosely based on Alice in Wonderland is another great excuse to employ an all-white cast and another skinny blond lead. Overall a shallow shiny package that failed to present anything genuinely meaningful or thought-provoking.,Alice in Wonderland,Alice in Wonderland - Movie Reviews
1579,Nathan D,"Jul 19, 2021","First off, I want to state how boring this movie is. It has serious pacing issues with it moving so slow. Some of the scenes were stretched out for too long and include unnecessary dialogue and weird visual elements. For instance, the Futterwacken scene at the end of the movie is not funny and wastes time. I appreciate the call back to the actual book, but it's just not amusing to watch. This wasted time could have easily been put to good use in the final battle scene which is so anti-climatic. It's such a shame that we went on such a long journey through Wonderland just for the final battle to be only around 10 minutes with 2-3 minutes of that being the Jabberwocky battle. The story is also very poorly written. It all just falls apart after Alice makes her way into the Red Queen's castle. The whole ""Um"" bit is not funny whatsoever and is stretched out way too long. I know that Alice has grown and that whole aspect does make some sense. However, the Knaves of Hearts not noticing it sooner or pointing it out sooner made no sense and felt like just a lazy way to create the heist scene. A lot of the Red Queen's story is very poorly written which is such a shame because Helena Bonham Carter does a good job in the role. Speaking of the cast, it's a mixed bag. The voice cast does a nice job, but the on-screen talent is a little off. Both Johnny Depp and Mia Wasikowska have some nice moments, but their line delivery is off most of the time. As I said before, Helena Bonham Carter does a nice job as the Red Queen. Crispin Glover and Anne Hathaway do a decent job, but their roles feel more like parodies of the characters rather than them actually embodying the roles they were placed in. The world around these characters is really bad. The visuals are so bland and dark that it doesn't even feel like Wonderland. I get why Tim Burton would have made that choice as their lives are all kind of miserable at the moment, but even the flashback scenes look dull and unimaginative. I would have loved to have seen some more color pop off the screen when Alice defeated the Jabberwocky. I think it would have made the film's final scenes in Wonderland be more at a decent level rather than just outright bad. Overall, this film is just a big mess with poor editing, a below-average story, and a cast that doesn't quite shine. Tim Burton doesn't do anything outstanding and just feels like lazy directing and storytelling. When Tim Burton said he had never felt any emotional tie-in to the book, that should've been some major red flags that this film would not be good in any shape or form.

What are common traits of Mercury Poisoning? Depression. Anxiety. Clumsiness. Hallucinations. Who was Mercury in mythology? The God of Thieves, and a messenger to Gods. What does Mercury hold in his hand? That is the Caduceus. That is Kundalini. That is the ancient brother-sister duo battling themselves; Fuxi and Nuwa. If we are all sitting at the table of the Mad Hatter, we are bound to have consumed his poison.

The plot is drastically changed from the original book, but it still have charm and uniqueness of story. Alice the protagonist of the story have grown up to a woman and forgotten Wonderland, she was expected to be someone she's not and still can't find her way. She is brought to Wonderland again by white rabbit according to the prophecy that ‘Alice' will slay Jabberwocky save but there's a question that ‘Is she the right Alice, the same one in the prophecy' and Alice also doubt that. Life of Alice is not smooth and Wonderland become a place full of danger but that's what make this movie interesting. Some characters are threaten, kidnapped, prisoned, and nearly executed but it's still in safe zone that people every age can watch together. In climax, Alice enter the war and slay Jabberwocky, fighting scene is not exciting and quite predictable for fantasy adventure movie with no fight experience woman protagonist but the war end beautifully. When back to her world, she returns as an elegant, brave and confident woman who walk in her own way. The background is mysterious but powerful and beautiful.

1598,Jonathan K,"Jan 15, 2021","Despite how serene the lead actress is and how competent the CGI is constructed, this might be one of the most unpleasant looking movies I have ever seen. Yes, it's Tim Burton so it's meant to be at least semi-repellent visually, but Tim Burton also relies almost entirely on his visual aesthetic, which makes this unpleasant aspect of the movie the central focus. What's unfortunate is that this was originally sold to many audiences as an Adaptation of the American McGee version, which already looks like a Tim Burton version, just better, with far, far better writing, so this would've been better. Instead, we're left with the kind of poor-to-abysmal quality script that seems to accompany most Tim Burton films, not only giving us wonky and sometimes incoherent storytelling, but even manages to mold the movie with almost every current-day Cinematic Fantasy Cliche, resulting in an Army vs Army battle with Alice as some kind of makeshift Valkyrie with a magic sword. There is good to be found -- Burton's usual use of slightly over-the-top performances complements this world as it's over the top in itself, Elfman turns in a surprisingly pleasant and epic score (considering all of his past scores for Burton films have just been off-key strings to make you feel icky and uncomfortable), and the art, while inherently repellent, is actually of solid quality for the most part; like, if I saw many of these on some place like DeviantArt I would think ""That's pretty interesting"" - the problem is that the movie never stops with it. It was a miscalculation to have the Evil Queen get so much screen-time as she is far and away the most visually unpleasant aspect of the movie, and the fact that the movie was made during the 3D boom means that she is commonly in ultra-closeup. And frankly, it just feels like Tim Burton isn't fitted to make a movie that is >90% CGI - he does have some talent with the tangible, physical world, and this movie makes me feel happy that he has opted to stay away from this kind of filmmaking since.",Alice in Wonderland,Alice in Wonderland - Movie Reviews

1604,Meydiana R,"Oct 31, 2020","I went into this film without high expectations. I saw so many ways it could go wrong, and many of Burton's more recent films have left me feeling somewhat indifferent. However, all my fears were for naught. I adored the film, without reservation. Indeed, this is not only one of Burton's best films, it is probably the best screen adaptation of Lewis Carroll ever (with the possible exception of Jan Svankmajer's Neco z Alenky from 1988). It isn't often that a film ends and I immediately want to see it again, but that's how Burton's Alice in Wonderland affected me. The cast is flawless, top to bottom. The film's vision comes the closest anyone has come to capturing the frenetic, nonsensical impossibility of Wonderland (and I loved the whole ""Underland"" thing). I'm hearing all sorts of bizarre negative criticisms, though none with merit. This is a bold and triumphant film, one that finally addresses, without holding back, the darkness and complexity and maturity of Carroll's writing. I will add that I saw it in 2-D, and was pleased that Burton avoided letting the 3-D thing ruin the movie, as is so often the case with that sadly popular gimmick. The film is a giddy, hallucinatory, unrelenting dance of shadow and light, hilarious and heartbreaking, brash and underscored, possessed of all the marvelously contradictory oppositions that characterize the source material. For the first time, I think, it felt as though Alice were truly an integral part of the landscape, and not just some baffled Victorian tourist passing through. And the climactic battle with the Jabberwocky...just wow. I cannot recommend this film strongly enough. (--Caitlín R. Kiernan)",Alice in Wonderland,Alice in Wonderland - Movie Reviews

I've seen it at least 5 times, but each time it remains a perfectly aimed film. The animations are spectacular and from 10 and praise: the hairs are treated in detail and the areas of the city are memorable. Even in the characters sector we only have iconic characters: Nick is my favorite, well characterized and with a poignant background. Judy is a great protagonist and with a beautiful story arc. The sheep is a nice twist villain that the first time I wouldn't have bet a cent on her, and good motivation too. The story is deeply inspired, unpredictable and manages to entertain. The jokes are genuine and very funny. Zootopia is a great film that makes perfection its philosophy: there is nothing negative to mention and I'm really trying to find something!

There's a modicum of comedy, a dose of mystery and an underdog component but no facet of the movie is fantastic.

Despite how much time is spent on action scenes they accomplish very little narratively.

I rewatched it with my wife and managed to enjoy it, but the decision to shoot in 48fps was even more jarring at home since we watched it only a couple days after finishing the LOTR trilogy. I actually loved the changes Peter made to flesh out the story into a trilogy; it did cause the runtime to bloat more than seemed necessary, but The Hobbit is actually one of the worst-written books I have ever read in my life and I've held that opinion since the first time I read it at age 12. If I hadn't read it myself I would have never believed that anyone, let alone a vaunted GOAT writer like Tolkien, had ever written a book whose entire purpose is building toward the excitement of the Dwarves' showdown with the dragon at the end, only to hastily cram in a different character in a single chapter and have him be the one to kill the dragon. My hatred of Bard the Bowman has colored my entire life since then, as I have a heightened sensitivity to perceived deus ex machina and I dislike Luke Evans as an actor because he played him. The only other gripe I have here is that Thorin was portrayed as rude, entitled and aggressive from the very beginning here, making his eventual heel turn completely unsurprising and his redemption arc ineffective at making me like the guy.

Devoted fans of the book will not enjoy the departures and inclusions, but for movie fans who did not ingest JRR Tolkien's dense and sometimes slow-moving children's story in their pre-teenage years, this film version will entertain more than adequately for its entire (long) length.",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - Movie Reviews
1687,Mohammed A,"Mar 28, 2021","A solid prequel to Lord of the Rings. It's nowhere near as good but that doesn't mean it's bad and expecting a movie as good as LOTR is basically you setting yourself up for disappointment. Every actor is amazing, especially Ian McKellen, Andy Serkis and I prefer Martin Freeman's Bilbo Baggin over Elijah Wood's Frodo Baggins. It has some well-choreographed action that makes creative use of the environment, it's visually dazzling and I know people have a problem with the overuse of CGI in these movies but this movie is innocent in that complaint and it's great seeing old locations like Rivendell and new locations as well as new creatures like goblins and it was a joy being back in middle earth, which is what I wanted. It can be funny and supenseful and a lot of amazing character moments like when Bilbo rescues Thorin and Howard Shore delivers an excellent score again. There's a lot of filler like the stuff with trolls and stone giants and it does drag in lots of places. There's no need for this to be nearly 3 hours long and it also lacks the suspense and stakes of the original series we're not 100% invested in the dwarves's journey as the consequences of failing won't be big. Plus, it has some tonal inconsistencies and a lot of moments where apparently physics doesn't exist but regardless, it's an enjoyable time and I'd definitely rewatch it.",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - Movie Reviews

Yes, it does a great job with world building and cinematography. Even the acting and plot is well done. But the fatal flaw here is it is trying to set up something that has already happened (Star Wars prequels, anyone?) LoTR was an expansive world-ending extravaganza, whereas the Hobbit (at least the book) was supposed to be one quiet hobbit's experience with the outside world. The movie flips that all around and makes the Hobbit quite a big more expansive (and longer) than maybe it should have been.

Aunque no sea una gran película, esta película logra ser entrañable en pocos minutos, con personajes muy originales y muy bien construidos, en pocos minutos te enamoras del mundo de Harry Potter. Me parece que los efectos especiales de esta película envejecieron muy mal. Muchos quedando al día de hoy en pañales, aunque los efectos prácticos de esta película siguen estando igual de frescos e impactantes. Otra cosa que no me encantó de la película fue que en muchos momentos la trama se siente estirada, creo que la película tiene muchas escenas que no aportan mucho a la película y eso la hace tediosa en algunos momentos.

The main plot of the movie does not get introduced until well into the movie, and even then the main plot doesn't get much screen time at all. It's interesting to see the characters behave in the situations they are put in, but not as interesting as if these situations actually had some relevance to the plot. I feel like if this movie was released in modern times, it would not have had any sequels, much like many other movies that focused too much on setting up a sequel and forgot to be a good movie itself.

This a clearly a big budget film, and the quality shows through in all areas.

1714,ANDERSON G,"Aug 17, 2021","""Hary Potter"" is the beginning of everything, the beginning of a saga that would become one of the greatest anthologies of cinema that garners many merits, being a good adaptation of the book, a remarkable creation of characters, costumes and aesthetics, the last being its greatest merit. The script adapted by Steve Kloves manages to synthesize the most important elements of the book, of course, the book is more tense and complete, but steve manages to bring the spirit to the screen just like its director, Chris Columbus, who gives a really magical touch to the film, whether in its details, in its dark photography, the magical elements in the compositions of gothic and bizarre backdrops to even its perfect soundtrack, adding that to a great cast that perfectly matches its characters, the biggest merit here is the feeling that we are watching something really wizard, the displacement with reality is very well constructed. Far from being perfect but extremely competent, ""Hary Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" sums up the books well, has great characters, although not yet performative, has a beautiful direction, good effects for the time and a timeless art direction.

The CGI was a bit not smooth at times, but it was still good considering the technology at the time. The main trio was also introduced, and their dynamic was also entertaining. I especially liked Emma Watson's character the most. She was clever, talkative, and quirky. And because of her confidence she didn't get too many friends, which was sad, but she's in the trio now. Since I enjoyed the magical world a lot, I honestly didn't care much about the main story of this movie. Even though there's a twist that was unexpected, I still didn't feel much about it. This movie's primary objective was clearly to introduce Harry Potter and the world he just stepped into, so the main story wasn't focused on as much. Overall, an entertaining and fun movie.

1750,Tom R,"Oct 31, 2021","Firstly, it was a great idea to split the final book into 2 parts. They should have done that with other books as well. Secondly, even though alot of this film is ""build up"" - it's still entertaining the whole way through - gives us some of the darkest trials and tribulations our trio has faced - and includes the saddest death in the series of all time. It's an emotional roller coaster and prepares the setup for an incredible ending. This film is still a must see affair for all those watching Potter - and it's best to play very close attention, you'll have nearly zero questions at the end of the series.

1751,Karina A,"Sep 29, 2021","One of my favorite movies is Harry Potter. This is a whole series of films directed by Chris Columbus. The first film was released in 2001 in the UK. The films are based on books by Joan Rowling. The story tells the story of an orphan boy living with his uncle and aunt. On his 11th birthday, Harry suddenly learns that he owns magic and goes to Hogwarts. There he meets Hermione Ron, and the main events of the films take place with them. The scenery of the film simply fascinates with its beauty, delightful landscapes, flying on brooms, everything immerses you in this magical world.

Instead the audience are stuck watching their favourite characters brooding in a variety of forests, causing the audience member to become quite bored.

The opening scene of this movie was the best so far. The long chase through the Muggle's world was fast and riveting. The camera angles were creative with many cuts. They were a little bit disorienting, but still entertaining. What I liked the most was in this one, the trio spent most of their time together. Everywhere they went, the dark order was there and ready to ambush them. Even worse, the danger was so great that it affected the friendship. Also the romance, not as big of a part in this one, was still there. I enjoyed the focus on the trio quite a bit. In addition to the trio trying to run away from the dark order, they learned more about the history of you-know-who, as well as other important characters. There was a lot of mystery being explored, and it got me invested throughout the runtime. Overall, a dark and grim continuation of the story that is nearly coming to an end.

1774,Jordan M,"Apr 09, 2021","While still great, this was the least-best movie of the series for me. Not only was it by far the least-entertaining, the section of the book this covers was rather poorly written, and them splitting it in two left far too much time for scenes that weren't as good as the second-act scenes of the rest of the series had been. Without the structure of Hogwarts a lot of the scenes felt written for the sole purpose of tying up character arcs -- it would've been illogical to hold a big wedding when there were practically still warm corpses laying about and it didn't make sense for Voldemort not to be in Malfoy Manor or quickly summoned there when they identified Harry's friends. That scene and the finding of Gryffindor's sword felt like deus ex machina in that their way out of the mess was far too convenient and unlikely. Dumbledore obfuscating the clues Harry would use to locate Horcruxes to the point he risks them not being found at all doesn't withstand scrutiny either; obviously he needed to keep the information secure, but he would've thought of a more practical way... in the very first movie he bewitched a mirror so that only a person with good intentions would get the stone by looking at it, for example. Nearly all the character development in this half is dark & they spent a little too much time visually flirting with ruining Ron & Hermione's budding romance. Also, they could've chosen a more cinematic way to interpret the book stranding the trio in the woods multiple times and the film score was unmemorable, though not as poorly done as HP5's. They at least did a good job setting up the finale by getting all of the boring parts out of the way, and I cannot dislike any movie with this much emotional investment, no matter how poorly it pays off in this particular instance.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 - Movie Reviews
1775,Hayden P,"Apr 09, 2021","So...I'd still say that the first half of the Deathly Hallows book is better than this movie.

It's not exactly perfect, but it is a good build-up to Part 2, and I'd still recommend Part 2 over this one any day.

1781,Smith T,"Mar 04, 2021","Well here we are... at the end of it all. I would like to first point out that the first 45 minutes of this film are a 10/10. They are truly some of the best minutes you'll watch in this entire saga. Now with all of that out of the way, I'm going to say what's on my heart. THE REST OF THE MOVIE IS BORING! Like wtf happened to the pacing? It's like it just gave up. One minute you're riding on the back of a dragon and then the next you're listening to someone talk about someone... talk about someone. This movie had a lot of great things going for it and then waste it as soon as they get out of act 1. And don't even get me started on the whole conflict between Harry, Hermoine and Ron. It feels so useless and unearned. It's literally a conflict for the sake of conflict. It isn't growth for anyone and it's on the boarders of character assassination for Ron. Like when they aren't all acting like assholes, the movie is actually able to move forward. The plot begins to progress and everything feels right again. But damn it if that feeling doesn't take a long time to appear. But yeah, as you can probably tell, that ""conflict"" is my biggest problem with the story. Well, that and pacing, but at least that doesn't make you gag. Other than those two things, the movie actually quite good. It's what I wanted in teh Half-Blood Prince that I didn't get. I definitely think if stopped watching it after HBP (like I almost did) then you should reconsider.

1808,Dale R,"Nov 15, 2021","A boy raised by wolves takes a walk through the jungle and happens upon animals with differing opinions on his well being. To the film's credit, it is wonderful to look at. Knowing that the only real thing we are looking at is Neel Sethi, who plays Mowgli, is truly a wonder for the time. All the animal characters look photo realistic. Casting Bill Murray as Baloo was a terrific idea. Ben Kingsley is great as Bagheera, Idris Elba plays a menacing Shere Khan and I love Scarlett Johansson's take on Kaa. Now here is the problem: they tried to keep the musical aspect of the original animated feature. I love the music from the original, I believe the music made that movie great. But here it is gutted from its intended purpose and is only included for nostalgic reasons. Scarlett Johansson's version of ""Trust In Me"" is great, but they only used it during the end credits because they needed her character to be an exposition dump. That is a terrible use of Johansson's talent and the money they spent for her studio time to voice Kaa.

Disney has remade its classic Jungle Book (1967) and turned it into a visual feast for the eyes. This movies special effects are so realistic, it’s hard to believe that nothing was shot on a set and it was all computer generated. The cast is complied of Hollywood’s finest actors and actresses, all lending their voices to these beautifully rendered computer generated animals. This film in my opinion delivers more emotion than the cartoon and also I think is a better movie than the original as well. This movie would suffer completely if the animals didn’t breathe and come to life the way they do.

1840,Cris K,"Jul 17, 2020","Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend. I'll honestly go as far as to recommend this over the original 1967 version. I don't think is quite as charming as the original, and it has a very different animation style, both with great quality of detail in it. From the individual strains of fur, to the types of animals included (I've done so much research on Indian wildlife today), you can really see the details of the cg effects. Just watch the end credit sequence alone, and it'll prove it. There are 3 huge improvements to this versus others: Sher Khan's face, King Louie, and the intensity of the animal fight scenes. The movie isn't free of problems: I imagine someone will have issues with talking animals vs non-talking animals, that he'd have to learn the language (so how would he ever understand Sher Khan or Baloo?). If anything, I think the writing took a hit. Where the original had a subtle but strong fables sequencing to it (sort of modular moral stories with shifting focus on characters), this is structured much closer to how many video game stories are structured, serialized chapters with some level of power creep and shifting focus of environment and goals but all focused on Mowgli. And I don't think the writing is bad, but this Jungle kid (never actually reveals his backstory, somewhat of a relief honestly) is performing clean engineering using vines and pulleys and armor (that wouldn't work) with calculated positioning. I understand that some people just have talent for some things, but I had to question whether or not I could do the same thing. I could, but I'd have to do it different ways. And in all fairness some of the stupid /inconsistent things he gets up too, even though he's a ""take charge"" Mowgli in this version really got to me: I was literally cheering for Sher Khan at certain points. Ultimately I had a good time with it, and I think most people and possibly their pets will too (my cats were interested for a while).",The Jungle Book,The Jungle Book - Movie Reviews

The voice cast is incredible, who bring plenty of charisma and energy to their roles, with the standouts being Bill Murray as Baloo and Idris Elba as Shere Kha.

I liked Jumanji when it came out in 1995 so, you can imagine my hesitation when I heard about this film. Expectations went up upon hearing Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson was going to be the lead. I love me some Dwayne Johnson man! This movie is an absolute blast to watch. It is entertainment first and foremost and yet it does add some much-needed characterization to some of these kids. I will admit that I wasn't a huge fan of the extreme stereotyped version of the kids at the beginning but, once the movie got going I understood why they did that. Overall, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a extremely fun movie that you can watch over and over again.

1852,Stephy S,"Sep 21, 2021","A short but sweet coming of age movie. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a solid action movie that plays it safe which is both its biggest strength and weakness. Most stuff in here is solid but nothing special, that being said, the cast is one of the best ensembles of A-list actors I've ever seen. From Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson to Karen Gillian to Kevin Hart and even Jack Black, every actor is a recognizable face and delivers on a phenomenal performance. Their chemistry is nothing to scoff at either as they all seem like high school students who only recently got to know one another. The special effects are also top-notch with some of the most gorgeous landscapes, intricate designs that translate beautifully into a 3D environment and some entrancing particle effects. One thing I don't like is the pacing, it felt like they had an actual plan for it but it fails miserably. The story structure is supposed to represent an action videogame but it just doesn't work on film in the slightest. The slower-paced, more emotionally driven scenes feel rushed and the action sequences feel rushed. Another thing this movie kinda misses the mark on is the tension. They wrote themselves into a corner with the life system they wrote so to get out of it, they just start taking them away for the sole of comic relief and having dire stakes. These things could've definitely benefitted from a revision or two. On the contrary, the soundtrack is an absolute blast! From the orchestral themes to the licensed songs, they're all excellent. It would've been a crime if they made a movie called ""Welcome to the Jungle"" and not have the infamous Guns 'n Roses in it!

In my opinion, though the battles and fantastical plot lines spark much excitement through the films, the real magic is between the characters throughout the franchise. You get the best of both worlds; a great fantasy plot, with queer relationships with depth and growth. Queer viewers rarely get both of those things, so the Hobbit is extremely rare in that respect. The Hobbit makes it clear that romance is not all about kissing, and that queerness travels between worlds.

While this movie has an amazing final 30 minutes the movie is quite hard to get through for the first 1 hour. This movie has the biggest struggle with the tone, as people are cracking jokes during the war... This movie is a fun final conclusion but it is never even close to becoming a fun final chapter. This movie also deals with a terribly paced movie, having extended scenes for no reason, and having a bland dialogue.

1927,Ryan S,"Feb 22, 2021","Exactly what it says on the tin - to a fault. Don't get me wrong, I like it. However, towards the end 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' definitely begins to drag quite heavily - the impact of what eventually happens did not, to be honest, hit as strongly as it could've/should've. The pure action is good, but there's not much to remember about everything else. None of the characters, with the exception of Richard Armitage (Thorin) and Luke Evans (Bard) I guess, stand out amidst the wall-to-wall battle. Martin Freeman (Bilb), Ian McKellen (Gandalf) & Co. are are of little importance really, which is a shame. 'The Hobbit' series, unfortunately, gets inferior as it goes by. Loved the first film, enjoyed the second but this third installment - while passable - leaves me with a feeling of wanting something else from it.

Once again Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Bill Nighy deliver outstanding performances. Tom Hollander as Cutler Beckett also deserves props, as does Keira Knightley who was allowed to shine more in this film. The final action sequence, while long, does provide excellent action and a very satisfying ending for all the characters. The special effects were well done and hold up to age well.

I am planning on buying the whole saga on bluray, but for now I saw the first on vhs and then the third on dvd and I had a very hard time believing it was a sequel to the excellent, enjoyable flick that is The Curse of the Black Pearl.

Elizabeth: A badass, portrayed beautifully by Keira Knightley. Barbossa: An extremely welcome addition. Davy Jones: A more interesting villain. Worldbuilding: Really interesting and creative. Story: A good follow up to Dead Man's Chest and I love the scale of the movie and I don't get why people say it's convolutef or confusing. It makes perfect pense and the movie really feels epic. Emotional weight: It lands with many deaths and a heartwarming finale for Elizabeth and Will. Beckett: More of a threat. Shch an underrated villain. Creativity: Through the roof. Entertaining: Definitely. There's a lot to like in this movie but there's also stuff I disliked. Length: Too long. Did not need to be 168 minutes long. Orlando Boom: Generally stiff performance and I'm not a fan of how Willmwas written. Pacing: not very good.

Finally, the effects and use of Smaug in this movie is something that surprised me with how well it was done.

It's much better paced with barely any boring moments, better choreographed action sequences especially the barrel sequences, it was cool seeing the ring having an influence on Bilbo and he once again has many great moments, Benedict Cumberbatch was an amazing Smaug (and that CGI is remarkable) and the scenes with him and Bilbo were so suspenseful, we got to see brand new locations in this movie, Tauriel was pretty awesome and once again, it absorbs you into the story of Middle Earth with great character moments and the stakes and suspense are higher and you feel that throughout the movie, this time for the actual world as we see Sauron's forces gathering and Suaron himself. Not to mention it's visually stunning. It's not perfect though. The romance with Tauriel and Killi is so forced and just weird (an elf and a dwarf?), it was annoying that we did not get to see much Gandalf and it's really convenient that Tauriel and Legolas arrived at LakeTown at the perfect time. Most of the dwarves are still forgettable The weakest part is the cliffhanger and it's not an Empire Strikes Back or Infinity War cliffhanger where it still felt like a complete story.

While an Unexpected Journey suffered from a slow pace, that had an uneven tone, this movie thrives off of the faster pacing, and better mixing of tone. The only downgrade is the script which does go down in quality in favor of the faster pacing and more thrilling sequences. As a sequel it does its job exceptionally well, building up characters, and raising the stakes. Only if this movie had a sharper script, I think this could have been an amazing watch.

The conclusion is what affects it the most, in my opinion. It isn't anything bad, but it goes on for too long - yet the ending itself comes out of nowhere a little. It's iffily crafted, with the entertainment value not enough to cover it up. Again, nothing anywhere near terrible... just not as great as I wanted/expected. I also kinda wanted more scenes with Martin Freeman (Bilbo) across the midway point. I like the focus on Richard Armitage (Thorin) & Co. but I felt there needed to be more with the lead - and with Ian McKellen (Gandalf), for that matter. I've led with my negatives first, but I have many positives too. I enjoyed the scenes in Esgaroth with Luke Evans (Bard), all of the stuff there looks awesome. The character of Tauriel, played by Evangeline Lilly, is cool. Orlando Bloom (Legolas) remains fun to watch. Everything else, including the score, is very nicely done - as anticipated.

Most notable by far were the film score, arguably the most memorable of the three movies, followed by the introduction of Gollum and the revolutionary CGI quality that came with him. The flaws in this one have the benefit of being made much worse by their expansion in the third movie, that being the deus ex machina and Frodo's transformation into a burdensome wuss, and even those could be considered more a gripe with the source material than the actual filmmakers.

As the Fellowship is broken, the remaining former members are separated into smaller groups which actually allows for some development for characters, whether they are important like Aragorn or more of a side character like Pippin. The Two Towers (2002) actually offers a lot more greater things than The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) with diving deeper into themes about the hypnosis the Ring provides as well as some huge scale battles, however the pace is a lot slower and more dialogue heavy than its predecessor, which at points can be really long to sit through.

2043,Puroo R,"Jun 21, 2021","The Lord of the Rings is one long story divided among three movies, which is the reason why it is hard to review this movie in itself. I have already written a review for The Fellowship of the Ring, in which I talked about how awesome the visuals of the story are, the philosophy behind the ring and the pop culture icon that it became. That is why I won't talk about those things in this review. Rather I will talk about the characters of the movie and why it has such a huge impact in the pop culture in spite of being nearly 20 years old book adaptation. Percy Jackson has done a really great job. The story picks up from the part where Gandalf was attacked, except this time it happens from the other point of view. This not only helps the viewer remember an incident that was important from the previous movie, but also makes it interesting by not showing the exact same shots again. While previously we believed Gandalf to be just a weak old man, over here he turned out to be a strong wizard. This is the reason why it paid off to see him return as Gandalf the White. The thing I really like aobut Gandalf is that he is a perfect balance of powerful and emotional character. In one moment he is being spun around by Saruman where he is crying like a frail old man, and in the very next scene he is fighting a fire dragon. In the first movie he scared Bilbo for a second by threatening him with magic if he dared to wear the ring, but immediately after he joined the Hobbits in the party. This is the trait which adds character depth to him, preventing him from being a two dimensional person. This way we get to see him from multiple perspectives. The second character I'd talk about here would be Gollum. The first time I saw him I thought he's just another one of those cringy skinny characters every fantasy movie needs to have (Jar Jar from Star Wars prequels, Dobby from Harry Potter etc). But he's very different. Earlier he was just a normal person like the rest of us. However, it was the temptation of the ring that completely ruined him, not just emotionally but physically too. Now in spite of his immortality he wastes himself searching for an addiction he has never been able to get away from. This is the reason why in spite of not actually wanting to hurt Frodo, he is unable to convince himself that what he is doing is actually wrong. This message is very clear in the scene where he is talking to himself. Speaking of the scene where Gollum talks to himself, that scene is one of the many scenes which is able to show the emotions that the characters wanted to express. This is something that can be done only by a good cinematography, which is something Peter Jackson was able to handle. Even though that scene is ridiculed, the point behind the scene was to show how Gollum was feeling while planning to kill Frodo and not how he was actually looking like. There have been plenty of scenes where the characters have conversations, but I don't want to spoil the movie for you. And that scene was interrupted by Sam, who is the next character I'd speak about. Sam is Frodo's best friend and he can go to any limits to make sure Frodo is safe. He is absolutely pure of mind, which was shown in the first movie when he stopped Frodo from wearing the ring. Sam had heard that Gollum wanted to kill Frodo and even though Gollum was the only one character who could actually help them reach the Mountain of Doom, Sam was ready to take the risk even if it meant having to get lost. Frodo didn't trust him or rather should I say, didn't WANT to trust him. And in spite of being abandoned by his best friend, Sam never wasted any time to get back to saving Frodo. The movie also has many battle scenes, cool CGI, shows the Fellowship of the Ring fight alongside other kingdoms while Gandalf is not there to protect them. The action, the comic timings, the CGI, the acting, everything about this movie is absolutely great. The only mistake I made watching this was that I watched the theatrical cut of this movie. Because of this I missed a very important (and cool) scene from the story, which I was thinking would be answered in Return of the King. It has something to do with Saruman. So don't make that mistake. I'd say you should watch the long one, no matter how much more you have to watch. The Two Towers is the most underrated movie of the trilogy and I really wish it was talked about more. Only those people know about it who have watched the trilogy. That doesn't mean it's bad. That just means this trilogy should be watched more. Since The Fellowship of the Ring is the beginning of the adventures and The Return of the King is the conclusion, The Two Towers never gets any appreciation as it is sandwiched between the two. But in reality it is the movie which bridges the two. It is an essential part of the movie since this is where the maximum amount of character development takes place.",The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers - Movie Reviews

The Uruk-Hai are menacing in this movie along with Saruman, he actually feels like a real threat along with his foot soldiers and you get the sense that anyone can die in all 3 of these movies, with the stakes being set at the end of Fellowship. But the bar is raised as King Theoden and the people of Rohan retreat to Helm's Deep where they fight what is undeniably one of the greatest battles in cinematic history.

2047,Will C,"Jun 06, 2021","(Extended edition) This one is always better than I remember it being. Definitely the black sheep of the trilogy. The extended cut isn't as good as Fellowship's in my opinion as there are too many extraneous scenes in this cut that only serve to stifle the pacing. The worst offenders are the additional scenes of Merry & Pippin which were already the slowest parts of the theatrical cut. In this cut we get entire scenes that are utterly pointless and barely add anything, as well as some more comedically focussed scenes that seem awkward and out of place in the overall film. There are other scenes that help flesh out and develop characters which I feel should have been included in the theatrical version. For example, we get a much better explanation of Aragorn's lineage and history in this cut which is very important given the key role he plays in the plot of The Return of the King. Overall, I feel the theatrical cut of this film is the superior, especially for a more casual viewer. It may gloss over some aspects, but the pacing is much better.

It's a pretty difficult feat to have a good character that everyone genuinely hates, not for being a badly written character, but because of how well she is written, and Umbridge was done perfectly - I'd say Umbridge is the best example of a well-written character made for everyone to genuinely loathe.

This time, the school got ransacked by the Ministry of Magic, and the students weren't allowed to practice magic. I knew that after the fourth one, this movie series would get more interesting and investing. And I was right. Now, Harry Potter got into deeper danger as his mentality started to decay as the movie went on. The school ransacking plot was pretty alright. It did make me want to see Harry Potter and his squad succeed and bring down the faculties. Most importantly, I appreciated that Harry was able to bond more with the other students, not just with the trio. They used a lot more magic, which was always fun to see. The best part of the movie was near the end, it was the first time that we saw a full-out battle between the wizards. The atmosphere was intense, and I enjoyed the lot of it. Overall, another thoroughly fun display of wizardry.

2073,Jordan M,"Apr 07, 2021","I found it very difficult to separate this viewing experience from reading the source material -- they had so much plot to condense that it ends up being nearly all that we're left with. There's a distinct lack of joy de vivre as it's a rather solemn, darkly-toned book and they minimized parts in the movie that were bright points in the novel, like excising Quidditch and spending very little time at Grimmauld place. The composer basically just being some guy the director knew was a shockingly poor decision as he was clearly unprepared for so important a movie, producing the worst film score in the entire franchise. The acting from Imelda and Bonham Carter was very impressive but particularly with the former it wasn't so magnificent that it had me enjoying scenes with her character in them; my nostalgia for this series is rooted in the very first movie where there's a thick air of whimsy and wonder, and thus I generally dislike most of the deviations from that atmosphere, with Umbridge being the prime example. The third act of this is still a sight to behold and the whole thing is thoroughly enjoyable to watch, but for me this rates among the bottom of the franchise in terms of entertainment value.",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - Movie Reviews

By far this fifth instalment is the weakest out of the bunch and I know that a lot of content from the original was cut out. Some of my biggest issues with the film are the first and second parts that drag, the characters actually getting annoying and the overall theme of the film not making sense. However, the last third of the film gets much better as the character dynamics have more development and the climatic wizard duel was really well done which saves this film a lot.

2083,Brady K,"Jan 05, 2021","This movie has one main issue but for me it's doesn't take away from the movie that much. This movie feels rushed, it has moments where it's jumping from one story lane to the next and it's poorly set up. As I've said many times I wish rotten tomatoes was out of 10 instead of 5 because for me it's a 8.5/10 but since it's out of 5 I have to give it a 4.5/5 because I don't feel it's as low as a 4/5. This movie has a lot going for it a very well written protagonist, Harry takes a leadership role and thrives, but my favourite is the big wizard fight it's was ver very entertaining. One of my big issues with the Goblet of fire is how they tried to dive further into the personal lives of the characters and it didn't work this time they found the sweet spot.

Non terribile in quanto sono del parere che nessun film di Harry Potter sia totalmente orripilante, ma questo è stato onestamente il film della saga che ho apprezzato meno (sia come trasposizione del libro che come film a sè stante).",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - Movie Reviews
2087,Luke J,"Dec 29, 2020","Order of the Phoenix makes a big jump forward in terms of increasing the stakes and taking the story into darker, more serious territory. Whereas Goblet of Fire primarily focused on the school experience of Hogwarts- this one makes it clear that the focus is more on the beginnings of the wizarding war. This movie is great because the consequences are real and lasting- unlike most of the previous Potter stories where all of our main characters emerge unscathed. The adult characters play a much larger role- Gary Oldman as Sirius Black is a standout performance, and the younger cast are now closer to being adults than children. The themes are also maturing, touching on politics with the failures and corruption in the ministry. Poor leadership, abuse of authority, and the necessity of a questioning, rebellious spirit is a strong thread throughout the entire movie. The last 30 minutes of this movie have some of the high points in the entire HP franchise. The fights between the Order & Death eaters are exciting and tense. The battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore is the best one on one fight in the entire series.",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - Movie Reviews

As Marlin goes on his journey and develops his character, the characters he meets are all memorable and iconic. The aquarium crew are all memorable as well.

I have come up with the concept of normie long before it was created. Other than that it was also because I came from a very conservative family. I was not allowed to watch movies in theatre, especially not a Hollywood one. So as all the kids used to talk about it I grew into hating it. And when this movie came on TV I only watched it with a critical point of view. It was only years after when I watched it and truly appreciated it. Finding Nemo is a very colourful movie filled with many sea creatures. It is an excellent movie that can teach children about the different types of marine life. I have heard about how everyone started hunting for clownfish after this movie came up. Although this is a bit sad and very cruel thing to do it also shows the impact that this movie was able to create and how much people enjoyed watching it. The fishes were shown in a very cute manner, especially the pufferfish. The only problem I have with this movie is the lack of a story. It's just a fish going from point A to point B. Although this does make for a good story since it helps in character development and world building, but these things should not be done while completely sacrificing a good story. I think I really like this movie and I will watch that once again to truly appreciate it.",Finding Nemo,Finding Nemo - Movie Reviews

But I feel like this movie has something stronger than those two movies combine: comedy. This might be the funniest movie that Pixar has ever made, it's definitely the one I quote the most by a good bit. Dory alone is good for at least 7 quality jokes.

Rupper and Daniel's performance looks very strange, I don't remember if it was like that in the book but it doesn't look good in my opinion. Finally, it is a very interesting story since we know a lot about the background of the story and if it is not the first time you see the saga, there are things that make a lot of sense.

The story takes away a large percentage of what made the novel so interesting, in order to shoehorn in a bloat to the romance plot-line between Harry and Ginny. However, even with this change, said romance is abysmal, and considering it's the main focus of the movie, there's bound to be issues. With color pallets seem to swap with every scene, a cast of characters with some of the most annoying performances in the series, this movie falls flat on its face. This is incredibly ironic considering that the director previously did Order of the Phoenix, and then went on to film both Deathly Hallows parts, and both Fantastic Beasts movies, all of which were great.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - Movie Reviews

2133,Sarvesh A,"Oct 04, 2021","This is my least favorite of the movies. Both because it is unfaithful to the book and just because its a bad movie. Now I'll admit, if I hadn't read the books first, I might not have hated it as much. But even by itself: its not a good movie. I first want to disclaim: I understand the filmmakers have to cut out stuff to make the movie. My favorite book of the series is Order of the Phoenix and thats a damn good movie as well, event though they did cut out a ton of stuff. Why? They knew what to cut and what to focus on. That isn't the case here. Firstly, Voldemort's backstory is one of the best parts of the entire series. The detail, the buildup and the rhyming between the young boy in the orphanage, the charming student, and the terrifying Dark Lord is brilliant. So what do they do? Cut out all of the memories of his past except the orphanage one. I can understand cutting some of the stuff but at least give us the Gaunt memories. That is crucial to the story of Voldemort and his Horcruxes. But nope. All that great stuff is cut out in exchange for completely unnecessary and downright cringeworthy stuff (I'll get to this later. Secondly, the freaking Half-Blood Prince? Y'know the title of this damn movie? He's basically an afterthought. How many times is the Half-Blood Prince ever brought up in the movie? Barely, and even when he is, he barely factors into the story and Harry doesnt develop any sort of connection with him. The reveal that its Snape is completely tacked on in the movie unlike the book where it was a gut punch. In the book, Harry starts to relate to the Prince, even seeing him as a friend, and defending him against Hermione's suspicions. He helped Harry through the entire thing and is what gave Harry the knowledge to save Ron's life. And then it turns out that the Prince was actually the man who he hated, that sold out his parents and got them murdered (another important thing cut from the movie), in Harry's eyes, got Sirius killed, and now murdered the greatest man he ever knew. But in the movie, its just like, oh wait, is that supposed to be important? Lets add that in here even though the Prince isn't important for 90% of the movie. I swear, it feels lie this movie was just in its own land and then at the end they realized ""oh wait we want to make a ton of money off the next movie so we have to set that up."" Thirdly, Harry and Dumbledore's relationship. Both actors gave a fantastic performance. Hell in this movie, all of them did. Its the writing thats on the wall here. Dumbledore feels more like a plot device than a character. In the book, we see Harry and Dumbledore's relationship strengthening following the conversation at the end of the 5th book where all the feelings were let out. Dumbledore basically replaces Sirius as his guardians and we really get to see how close they are especially with Harry telling the Minister of Magic he was ""Dumbledore's man through and through."" But we dont get to any of that here. Nope, instead we get a cringy romance drama. Now, you might be noticing a core problem with these issues: cut out in exchange for nonsense. The stuff above is what should've been in the movie and half the stuff in the movie should've been cut out. Instead of delving into Voldemort's backstory, and advancing the character of Snape, they decided to make this movie a romance drama. Its all over the place. They also added in completely out of nowhere scenes like the Burrow burning which should've been serious but had no consequences... because it wasn't in the book at all and they realized they had to set up the seventh chapter. Thats a good chunk of screen time. Cut out all the unnecessary teenager drama, for God's sake. Was there drama in the book? Absolutely. But it was the subplot not the main plot. And it was handled a lot more seriously and/or better than it was in the movie. The drama serves the story, not the other way around, which is what the movie did. And thats the main problem with this movie. It focuses on the wrong stuff. All the melodrama, that sound be the stuff brought up here and there rather than being the main plot, the Half-Blood Prince and Voldemort's origins should be the main story. The screenwriters had this completely backwards. Yes, they would have to cut some of the good drama from the book... but thats okay. Like I said, I get that they have to cut stuff. They just cut the wrong stuff. But even then, if they handled the stuff they wanted to focus on well, I could call it a day and say its disappointing but overall a good movie. But they didnt. They even failed on all the drama they wanted to get across. If you want to make feelings and conflicts of interest the main story, at least do it well. But they even failed at that. Thee biggest example of this is Ginny and Ron. Now its pretty clear David Yates was someone who shipped Harry and Hermione from both the 6th and 7th movies. That doesnt mean you ruin other characters to get that done. I do think overall they did Ron worse than Ginny, but thats more in the 7th one. In this movie, it was Ginny that was ruined. In the books, Ginny was a sassy, confident, powerful girl who could stand up for herself and had a lot of nerve. Harry's feelings for her are built up throughout most of the book. Starting with a brief mention on the Hogwarts Express when he's unhappy that Ginny is sitting with Dean alone on the train and kicking off the plot with the scene after Quidditch practice. The drama between all the characters is very well handled in the book. In one scene, Rowling sets up grudges and building anxiety that really develop the main characters for the rest of the book. I'm of course talking about the scene where Ron and Harry run into Ginny and Dean kissing, which is where Ron's inner self-hate and jealousy as well as his insecurities are triggered by his younger sister and he finds out about Krum & Hermione, which sets up his story for the book, as well as the first time Harry realizes he likes Ginny. Unlike in the movie, they do care about Ron in the book, and Harry's inner conflict is between his feelings for Ginny and how his best friend would react if he was in Dean's place that day. Harry's feelings keep building, and later in the book, they start dropping hints that Ginny likes him as well. Ron also has a great journey where his core problem is observed: lack of self-confidence. Finding out about Hermione and Krum only made him hate himself worse, and when the Quidditch match came around and he won, he finally for the first time in his life could be proud of himself. Especially when he found out that he did it all himself, there was no Felix Felicis in his drink. He became confident, and that caused him to start becoming a jerk. Take somebody who has lacked power all their life, hated themselves for their weakness, and felt every time they were bullied, it was deserved because of weakness. And if you give them power, you'll create a greater monster than you ever could've imagined. Power in this case is self-confidence. His entire life, Ron's been overshadowed by his brothers, teased for his poorness, living in the shadow of his best friend, and now for the first time in his life, he's the one with all the attention, everyone loves him, he gets a self-confidence boost and THATS what causes him to be so horrible to Hermione. It takes a near death experience to break him out of this arrogant streak and ultimately, he becomes better as a person because of the experience. Both of these journeys come to a climax in this passage: ""We won!!"" yelled Ron, bounding into sight and brandishing the Silver Cup at Harry. ""We won! Four Hundred and Fifty to a Hundred and Forty! We won!"" Harry looked around; there was Ginny running towards him; she had a hard blazing look on her face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her. After several long moments — or it might have been half an hour — or possibly several sunlit days — they broke apart. The room had gone very quiet. Then several people wolf whistled and there was an outbreak of nervous giggling. Harry looked over the top of Ginny's head to see Dean Thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand and Romilda Vane looking as though she might throw something. Hermione was beaming, but Harry's eyes sought Ron. At last he found him, still clutching the cup and wearing an expression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head. For a fraction of a second they looked at each other, then Ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that Harry understood to mean, ""well — if you must."" This is the culmination of both their journeys. Harry finally acts on his feelings and Ron, who would've been angry if this happened at the beginning, after everything he's gone through, gives Harry his approval. THATS how you do drama well. And here's where I talk about why its just a bad movie. Instead of following the wonderful example set by the book, the writers of the movie decided to rush the relationships, remove any inch of explanation of Ron's inner journey and just have him be a terrible person in general that the perfect Hermione forgives immediately, and completely butchers Ginny's character. Ginny is for some reason in the movie still a shy little girl with a crush on Harry not having ever developed since the second book. The relationship between Harry and Ginny is rushed, and has some of the most cringeworthy scenes in any movie. The shoelace scene for one or pretty much any interaction they have. Its unwatchable. They rush the journey to get there, and do nothing afterwards. Seriously, there's nothing between them getting together and the end of the movie. All the added stuff with McLaggen & Hermione was pointless and stupid. I was actually okay with the Lavender stuff because Ron & Lavender were supposed to be portrayed as toxic. But I think they over exaggerated some of the scenes. In addition, if you need any more evidence, the moviemakers hate Ron, they gave his two best moments to Hermione. When he gives Harry his approval, and when he tells him they're coming with him wherever he's going to find the Horcruxes. Other things I didnt like: Dumbledore's funeral was not as impactful as it should've been. They did do something creative but they failed to describe how much Dumbledore meant to Harry and what it meant for Harry and the Wizarding World now that he was gone. They also cut out the fantastic scene where Harry is forced to push Ginny away from getting close to him, but at that point, they buried ship that so far there wouldnt have been any point. But two things they should've definitely kept: One, The Battle of the Hogwarts. The first one to be specific. In the book, when Harry ran down the Astronomy tower, cursing Death Eaters after Dumbledores death, he ran into a massive battle between the Death Eaters and the combined forces of Dumbledores Army and the Order of the Phoenix. Every character has a role, and afterwards, all the threads of the magnificent conspiracy by Malfoy and the Death Eaters are revealed, brilliantly tying up every plot point in the book. The Battle would've been so cool to see. Instead... we get nothing except Bellatrix laughing maniacally (I do have to say though, Bellatrix's actress is freaking fantastic, she has so much fun in the role and plays the woman that enjoys being evil so well that I understand them adding her into scenes she wasn't originally in and have no complaints there). Additionally, I hated how Harry kind of liked the fame he got in this movie. That is quintessentially against Harry's character. He HATES being famous, he hates being swarmed by people wanting to get near him all the time. Thats why its so meaningful when he uses that on Slughorn. Thats the only time he ever uses fame to his advantage, and he did it so that his mothers sacrifice wasnt in vain. But in the movie, he kinda likes being famous. The biggest example of this is when Hermione is trying to protect him from people trying to slip him love potions and tells him ""they only care about you know because you're the Chosen One."" And Harry says ""But I am the Chosen One."" That too, very pompously. That isn't Harry, its James. Harry would never say that. The real Harry would've been annoyed that Hermione didnt do more to stop the potions from being snuck and Hermione would never have needed to tell him that Harry wouldve either said or thought that himself. Oh wait, hold on. That is what happened in the book. They also completely cut Tonks from the movie, which was kinda annoying. Finally, Sirius's death had practically no repercussions. In the book, Harry is heavily hit by Sirius's death and spends all summer alone and refusing to eat, barely talking to anyone. So much of the first act includes the impact of losing his godfather on Harry. But in the movie, its almost as if Sirius's death never happened. He was there and now he's not. This movie is a dumpster fire. I didnt like the Goblet of Fire movie but at least they did the Graveyard Scene, the most important part of the movie right. It was so well adapted and shot faithfully to the epicness of the original scene that it nearly made me forgive them for completely dropping the ball on the Barty Crouch twist and a lot of other parts of the movie. At least the Goblet of Fire got the characters right, and while I dont think they did a good job with the mystery at all and ruined one of the best twists in the series, they knew what to cut for the most part and didnt sideline the main plot of the book. This movie fails to meet the very low standard of that movie. It hits very few good beats, fails with 3/4 of the main plots of the book, treats the darkest chapter of the series like a complete romantic comedy, and inserts stupid scenes that were never in the book which were either out of character, cringeworthy, or unnecessary with no repercussions. However, there are a few redeeming factors. Firstly, the acting. But sadly, not even great acting can save a bad script. Secondly, the plot with Malfoy was very well done and easily the best part of the movie. Thirdly, the effects are fantastic. And finally, they at least did the cave scene well.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - Movie Reviews

I don't have as much nostalgia for it as I do some of the others but it's inarguably the most complete movie of the lot, with absolutely perfect pacing (allusions toward the cabinet-related finale sprinkled in from near the very beginning), highly likeable new characters, a series-best level of comedy and a heavy focus on the three best side characters of the series with Snape & Dumbledore's parts expanded and Draco suddenly made at least 4x cooler than he was in the previous movies. Rickman, he of the dulcet intonations, is at his absolute peak with this one. They brought back Quidditch when it'd been sorely lacking from the previous two movies and they kept a healthy running time that allowed important scenes to breathe and be taken in by the audience. Most surprising of all was that the same man who'd put forth the worst film score of the franchise with HP5 returned and gave us a score that I felt was arguably on par or even superior to Williams's score for HP1; it was heavily bolstered by his use of Williams's themes, of course, but Hooper's felt more distinctive and it seemed to better match the atmosphere of each scene. My sole knock is that I wasn't quite as impressed by the cinematography as AMPAS was; I'm not a big fan of tinting an entire scene one color or the other and they do a ton of that here.

I had read the books and thought my disappointment with the movies was because there'd just be no way for a movie to live up to the books. Now I'm in the process of reading the books to my own children. They also want to see the movies, and so I'm treating myself to another round of the Harry Potter series to get a better handle on they will be able to handle the visual re-imagining of the story. I realise I can now better summarise why I think the movies fail. Although in this instance I'm talking about the Half-Blood Prince, the main problem seems to more or less affect all the movies. The heart of the matter is poor adaptation and screenwriting. Instead of wholesome stories, the movies feel like quick visual summaries of events that take place in the books on fast-forward. The Half-Blood Prince rockets along from one location and key event to the next without providing the due context for what is taking place. It's as if the writers of the movie knew that people would fill in what was missing from their memory of the book ...but that's not how a movie is supposed to work! A movie is supposed be able to stand on its own. It really is an art form to be able to condense a large story into one and a half-hours or maybe two. At two hours and thirty minutes, this monster still somehow feels poorly paced and rushed. The movie is like a malnourished overweight person. Plenty of mass, but little substance.

Ya la película al inicio tiene un excelente montaje musical con Accidentally In Love y ya para el final tiene la inolvidable escena con I Need a Hero; aunque también en general la película tiene un soundtrack increíble. El humor es muy inteligente y gracias a eso la película puede resultar muy entretenida también para los adultos y para todo el público en general. Los personajes son los mejores, desde el primer momento te encariñas con ellos y los personajes nuevos hacen que la película sea mucho mejor, son muy memorables todos; entre ellos el mejor villano de la saga que es el hada madrina. Por otro lado, el doblaje sigue siendo demasiado bueno sobretodo en español latino, creo que uno de los mejores doblajes que se hicieron. La animación sigue siendo excelente y obviamente supera a su antecesora. En conclusión, una muy buena secuela y mejor que su antecesora, me sorprende realmente que no haya ganado el Oscar como lo hizo la primera ya que para mi es la mejor de la franquicia, pero eso no le saca el puesto de una de las mejores películas de animación de la historia.

2184,Puroo R,"Jul 11, 2021","As a kid I hated Shrek. But after seeing it for the first time a few years ago, I decided that I really liked Shrek. I had to go on a vacation soon after finishing the first movie, so right after coming back I proceeded to watch the next one. And I think it's probably because of the trip or something, but I actually liked Shrek 2 more. There are many reasons why I feel this one is clearly superior to the first one, and why this is my favourite sequel among any movie (other than Lord of the Rings and The Dark Knight trilogies of course). The movie begins with the part where Shrek 1 ended. Shrek and Fiona are happily married and live their ogre lives in peace. The reason why this movie works so well is because unlike regular sequels, this one actually expanded on what could happen in future. If this was a conventional sequel it would have shown that Lord Farquaad has come back somehow and now he has joined forces with some other villain to beat them. Also some random characters would have been introduced while others would have been killed. The movie simply begins with the feeling of an adventure. Shrek, Donkey and Fiona going to Far, Far Away to meet Fiona's parents who have never seen her in the last 20 years, that's a perfect story. Remember how we thought about Shrek and Fiona before the first movie? We changed our minds for the better after we watched the movie and learnt a lesson. Fiona's parents, however, have still not seen that happen. And this is something Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming take the advantage of. The reason why this movie worked but the next two didn't was because this movie never dragged any concept. Shrek and the fairy tale characters became friends, Shrek and Donkey saved Fiona, they fell in love and married. Period. This was never 'revised' upon. Rather either the consequences of those actions or the other aspects of life were shown. Every scene looked interesting for some reason. It's almost like the creators poured all their love in every scene. No scene feels like they were just trying to get over it. Every moment is cherished: Fiona crying, Shrek meeting Puss, Shrek's friends watching TV - everything is memorable. Shrek 2 is how a sequel should be. It should give us exactly what we wish to know. It does not force any character, it does not force any scene. Everything that is introduced in this movie, every joke that takes place happens within the audience's interest. I really wish if a new Shrek movie is made, they make it like this. Shrek is meant to be something that is remembered for all time, not a meme. It's one of the most iconic 3D animated movies I've ever seen.",Shrek 2,Shrek 2 - Movie Reviews

2212,Billy R,"Nov 07, 2021","The story of Freddie Mercury is a tragic and hard-edged story about a immigrant gay man who did drugs and died of AIDS. The way this movie tells this story comes off as hollow and sanitised, there is so much inaccurate stuff in this movie like the fact that Queen broke up as a band because they were upset that Freddie Mercury got a deal for a solo album which upsets the band in the movie which never happened in real life because Roger Taylor released a solo album in the late 70s early 80s and in the movie Freddie Mercury tells the band he has AIDS a week before Live Aid in 1985 although he wasn't diagnosed until 1987.

Are we supposed to feel sympathy with the band who need to comply with his antics? Or take inspiration for how energised and on-board they are with his creative direction? The film flirts with the underlying tragedy of his private life and the illness that inevitably claims his life, but keeps it at arm's length to prevent the audience from getting sad when there's rock music to enjoy. So it's a good film but not an excellent one. Rami Malek is astonishing though, without question.",Bohemian Rhapsody,Bohemian Rhapsody - Movie Reviews

2231,Parker E,"Jul 02, 2021","It isn't terrible, I guess. I like Queen's music. Why does this movie have auto tune and lip syncing over the original recordings and not new recordings by Rami Malek unlike Taron Edgerton in Rocketman. I think it is really funny that the members of Queen get mad because they have to lip sync on tv but then they lip synced all the singing in this movie. The editing in this movie is terrible. How did this movie win an Oscar for best editing? I do not understand. They always say that Freddie is drunk or high but they never show him getting drunk or high, unlike Rocketman. The best way to describe it is that this movie is very sanitized and safe. The movie doesn't go into the real side of Freddie at all. The movie is also not factually accurate. Freddie got diagnosed with AIDS in 1987 but in the movie he gets diagnosed before the Live Aid concert which was in 1985. Rami Malek's performance is pretty good though. I liked the lawyer/manager character. The music is great but that has nothing to do with this movie. I do really like the Live Aid scenes though. The Live Aid scenes are definitely the best part of the movie hands down. I just find the Live Aid concert really cool and fascinating. I also believe Live Aid was probably the best concert ever. The story, being a true story is pretty interesting so I liked the story told in the movie. In conclusion, John Reid is a terrible person, lip syncing is bad, this movie is disappointing and mediocre but not the worst movie ever by any means and Rocketman is way better. I will say Rocketman is so much better, it's not even a competition. Bohemian Rhapsody wishes it was even near as good as Rocketman.",Bohemian Rhapsody,Bohemian Rhapsody - Movie Reviews

Maybe some scenes are created to move the story along. This is not a biopic. Most of the movie is simply invented by the writers and director. For example, Freddie didn't meet the other band members behind a van after their show; they were already roommates. There was no backlash against the Bohemian Rhapsody song; everyone loved it at the start. The band wasn't inspired to perform at Live Aid by Freddie's courage in the face of AIDS; he wasn't diagnosed with that until two years after that show. The movie at all times is heading towards that Live Aid performance, which was recreated shot for shot with the original footage.

2273,ANDERSON G,"Aug 22, 2021","Peter jackson is one of the best directors in terms of good budget use, the director probably learned that in his early career directing great trahs movies, and in ""The Lord of the Rings"" it's no different, peter makes a film of almost 4 hours grand, with impeccable costumes and makeup, great visual effects for the time and a wide range of magnificent backdrops and screen compositions, by comparison, the same year also came out Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone which cost 38 million more, although ""The Lord of the Rings"" seems much more expensive. I didn't read the classic JRR Tolkien book to know how it was transposed to the screen, but even with a long film time, we have zero waste, we have a story that constantly grows, full of arcs and a past that transports mythology, all of this combined with a classic and very well constructed hero arc that unfolds in a great intro drama, the film has four acts and a short last act that already leaves a plot for the sequel. The entire art direction of the film is exquisite, the feature film, which is already over 20 years old, leaves some special effects dated, it's true, but at the time it was very surprising and still convinces today, especially in its costumes and makeup, which are still great today. , photography and the use of the green background still work reasonably well, and the soundtrack is a show on its own, showing the inner emotion of each nucleus through its melodies. Peter Jackson works well not only the visual and script factor, but also works the small layers, such as obsession, fear and overcoming, and also knew how to squeeze the most out of his cast of actors, taking magnificent performances, such as de Ian McKellen for example. The film is very well worked in its most diverse layers, every shot is very well executed and formidable, the weakest point perhaps is the lack of coherence, violence and the sobriety tone of the work, which changes its state of mind constantly, but these are details that do not bother this work at all, which amuses, entertains and enchants to this day.

Hasn't that already happened I hear you ask. Well, yes, and here's the proof; Peter Jackson's first instalment of his staggering trilogy, and arguably the best of the three (although my opinion on that changes daily).

2285,Cameron K,"Aug 12, 2021","Well... I'm afraid that this movie is by far the most disappointing film that I've ever sat down to watch. I came in with the greatest of expectations, as I've seen countless amazing reviews, articles, and even been directly told of the praise that this movie ""deserves"". How it's ""better than the book"", ""truly riveting"", ""the greatest action movie to date"", and so on. However, I simply cannot agree with any of those claims. I think Peter cheapened much of the story, even beyond that of what's expected from compressing 423 pages down to 178 minutes worth of film *I watched the theatrical version*. Since this review is already getting very long I'm going to list out the changes that Peter made that I think were for the worse. -Merry was re-written to become a Pippin part 2, which is especially terrible since in the original story they were quite different. Merry starts out responsible and leader-like then has to deal with feelings of loneliness and usefulness. While Pippin starts out naive and mistake-ridden then learns to become responsible and valiant. -Elrond and Galadriel are very dislikeable. I could smell their superiority complex through my screen. -Gandalfs already 'not perfectly' written pre-fellowship journey becomes even worse. Like why go to Saruman before safely escorting the Hobbit to Rivendell? Why not go help the Hobbit directly after getting to Rivendell? What happened to the letter? -Aragorn and Gandalfs relationship is too mysterious. You don't see them interact with each other much, Gandalfs speaks of no importance with Aragon, and all that makes Aragorn's presence at the prancing pony even more convenient. Furthermore, why weren't the Hobbits more suspicious of him when they met? -Nazgul nerfed? Why was Aragorn able to solo 5 of the Nazgul with nothing but a sword and torch? In the book, they quickly fled because they thought that Frodo had no chance at surviving the wound, but in the movie, they stayed to fight with Aragorn for a bit before getting chased out because Aragorn was destroying them. -The Gandalf v Saruman fight was maybe the worst fight scene I've ever seen from such a big movie. Force pushing each other around with sticks, how exciting. -Elves were just cringy, with the blurring filter and ugly language, it was just too much. -Legolas, Gimli, and Boromir were less explained. In the books Legolas comes to tell about Golums escape, Gimli comes to discuss Saurons offer to the Dwarves on the lonely mountain, and Boromir comes to find counsel on his and Faramir's dreams. But in the movie, they are just there because they are important figures in their kingdoms. Although I have plenty of gripes with the movie I think it still did a fine job. I thought the production quality was outstanding, even for 2021's standards. I also like that Arwen became more prevalent in the story, although her being the one sent to help Aragorn and the Hobbits makes no sense but exploring her and Aragorn's relationship early on was a definite plus to the story. So overall I don't think it's bad but it stacks nowhere near the original story and I can't believe that anyone can say otherwise, but I seem to be in the minority so maybe I'm just wrong.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring - Movie Reviews

2292,Jonathan K,"Oct 07, 2021","There are a lot of neat concepts on display in this movie, and as such, it's a real shame that more aren't done with them. This movie is 157 minutes long, and only the last 10 minutes actually amounted to anything. The rest of it is a self-contained story that has very little in the ways of actual plot, and the big reveal at the end ultimately negates half of what came before, as it turns out that a good chunk of it was a ruse (but not in the ultra-satisfying way as something like Hot Fuzz or the first Saw). Throw in the fact that the movie is also darker and murkier than the other entries, before and since, and the very mediocre performance by Robert Pattinson (already one of the most over-valued people in the industry). The mystery element involving David Tennant's character, Harry Crouch Junior, is really the only thing of real interest beyond the end, but it never actually amounts to anything either, as the audience already knows that he's evil, and once he's found out, his story ends literally seconds later.. All in all, the movie isn't 'bad' by any means - it's just almost entirely meaningless in the grand scheme of things, and honestly, it's just self-indulgence that this movie was a solid hour longer than it needed to be.",Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Movie Reviews

The plot is about the Triwizard tournament, where each school's representative battled for the glory. But somehow Potter was chosen as the fourth contestant, and we have ourselves a fun and intense story. I was surprised and happy that I wasn't bored through another two and a half hours of this franchise. This is the first one that kept my interest throughout. Again, there were more unique wizard stuff that further expanded the universe. This was always fun to watch, and this movie still kept that tradition going. The first half actually was teen drama where the students went to a ball. The romance was more prominent, and even became naughty in some scenes. What drove the plot was the tournament, and the looming danger that hid beneath it throughout the runtime. When the imminent doom hit at around the last round of the tournament, the movie became vastly more intense. For the first time, I felt that Harry's life was in actual danger. As for problems, the runtime was still a tad bit long. Also, some of the rounds in the tournament were pretty weak an could have been more fun.

2321,Jordan M,"Apr 05, 2021","Newell did more things right here than Cuaron did with the third movie and it's not even close. He makes the most out of the lengthy runtime here by excising a lot of the subplots in the novel in an extremely successful way as it allowed more time to be spent on the climactic finale than had been allotted in any of the previous 3 movies. There was more interaction between the characters and a highly appreciable increase in comedy. The actors had grown up quite a lot and were doing better in each iteration at showing their acting range, with Hermione a particular highlight in this one. Doyle acquitted himself remarkably well, with his film score on par with Williams's previous three and the CGI had improved drastically even with only a year's time passing. Best of all was the source material itself as the underdog sports genre is probably my #1 favorite and the finale here is probably the best in the entire series, both the graveyard part and the quasi-epilogue reveal. I think Cuaron misunderstood the intended audience for these as his priorities seemed rooted solely in quality filmmaking instead of entertaining a mostly-teenaged audience, a concept Newell is apparently an expert at. The only criticism I have is that I think they could've found a few minutes to devote to the Quidditch World Cup instead of skipping the entire thing as that was one of the best chapters in the book!",Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Movie Reviews

2324,Swetha G,"Mar 18, 2021","The non-so magical review from a muggle. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a fantasy/adventure film directed by Mike Newell. It is based on J.K.Rowling's novel which was written in 2000 and carries the same name as the novel. It was released on November 23, 2005. It is as well the fourth part in the Harry Potter film series. Last Christmas, I saw this film and it was definitely one to remember. Just like past Harry Potter films this one didn't fail to amuse me. You could tell that this was filmed on a big-budget compared to the previous films of the series. To my mind I think this one offers a lot more than fantasy or adventure, it also gives you a lot of headspace to imagination. This piece of art surely left me astonished and filled with questions, wanting to watch the next part. As for the plot of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, it includes the three main characters to be grown up, as they enter their fourth year of the School of Wizardry and Witchcraft: Hogwarts. It holds a fair amount of violence, since Harry Potter, the main character has to enter the prestigious Triwizard Tournament as a minor and face some dreadful challenges along the way of becoming a champion. Throughout the film, new characters came to light. Some added a romantic aspect to the film, whereas others did not. For the 14-year-old Harry Potter, he endures pressure a normal teenager cannot handle to confront his biggest nightmare. With the help of his dearest friends, Hermione and Ron, he doesn't fail to succeed in the period of the tournament. After all, this is the year students prepare for the Yule Ball and dare to ask female students as their date to the ball. Yet, the charming part of the film quickly ends there, as Harry Potter will live up to his title as ‘The Boy Who Lived'. The Harry Potter series is known to leave every person astounded who is into fiction and/or fantasy. As for me, it was always a surprising experience watching through these films, as you notice the characters growing up from a young child to an adult. There is no doubt that J.K. Rowling is by far one of the most influential writers in our century. Not only, did she write several successful books but stands as a role model for young children and women. With the apparent cliffhanger at the end of the first film, it will leave you wanting more and you will end up watching the next films that follows up on the previous one. Personally, I am a lover of anything fictional, which is obvious why I am a fan of Harry Potter. Behind the success of these series, I suppose that watchers admire the films as they are not predicable as much as you think it would be. For instance, in this film, it gets quite dark quickly once you watch Harry get involved into life-or-death situations. Another example, is that Harry experiences tons of emotions in this film. As he goes through happy moments with his friends, he goes through the same amount of unknown moments and feelings. However, I must say that this is perhaps the most significant Harry Potter film so far. Mainly because, while I was watching this part of the series it felt like a mix of genres. Also, another example to why this film doesn't have a sole boring moment since it will keep introducing new characters throughout. For the Triwizard Tournament I mentioned earlier, there will be a ton of new, yet interesting characters added who bring a value to these films, which also was an enjoyable aspect. Lastly, this film was not excessively long but definitely long enough to tell the story. But there is one negative detail, that the films don't fully cover every single detail like the books do. So if you want to have a full understanding experience, I suggest you to also read the books so that you don't miss out on other details. Clearly, this masterpiece will be a hard one to forget, as it will stick to you for a longer time. It is not something that you will be able to forget soon, as it so famous. I would recommend this film to anyone who might be interest in fantasy and fictional characters. Furthermore, it is important to watch them in chronological order, since every film leaves a cliffhanger at the end which follows up on the next one. Lastly, I hope you get lost into the imagination of the magical world of Harry Potter, just like I did.",Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Movie Reviews

Something that this tape owed me was a better participation of Ron, since the appearance of Voldemort and Cedric totally overshadowed him, and they also made his character a bit like a crybaby and gossip, and I did not like that much.",Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Movie Reviews
2327,Hoan D,"Mar 06, 2021","Summary: This movie marks an important cornerstone in the development of the Harry Potter universe with the return of the Dark Lord Voldemort. It is set in Hogwarts during the fourth year of school, when the Triwizard Tournament takes place. It is a traditionally a competition between the three prominent schools of magic including Hogwarts, Durmstrang and Beauxbatons. Prior to the competition, the Goblet of Fire selects three students from each school to participate in the contest. Harry is unexpectedly selected and forced to enter the competition by the Goblet of Fire with three other students even though he never put his in the cup and he is also underage. Later, it is found out that one of the Voldemort's underlings cast an advanced spell on the Goblet to deceive it of Harry's age. During the first three rounds of the contest, Harry and the other students have to complete many difficult tasks such as rescuing underwater and fighting dragons. The climax of this movie comes when the four students compete to get out of the maze, the last round of the contest. However, Voldemort, still in his feeble from between dead and alive, and his underlings are in there waiting for the four, eventually killing Cedric from Hogwarts. Harry, after that, is capture, and his blood extracted and used to rebuild Voldemort into a strong physical form. Harry then duels against the Dark Lord for his life. He barely escapes Voldemort and eventually brings Cedric's body back to campus with the knowledge that Voldemort has returned. Analysis: The important turn of events in this movie heralds major change development of the storyline and the journey of Harry Potter as the main hero in this series. Harry is now no longer inherently safe from Voldemort like before when Harry's blood was has the magic against the Dark Lord. Now, both share the same blood as he used his Voldemort used Harry's blood to revive himself. Harry no longer is protected and now susceptible. He is now more representative of real-life heroes, who actually have vulnerabilities, not inherently indestructible by enemies as Harry used to be earlier in the series. This sharing of blood between Harry and Voldemort is also symbolistic of the struggles that real-life heroes have. It is like a connection across the dichotomy of good and evil, signaling the heroes also have their own evil side that they struggle against. Furthermore, when Harry's friend Ron turns against him, it further depicts Harry as a misunderstood hero. Ron estranged himself from Harry because Ron thinks that Harry intentionally enters himself into the contest for fame. However, later in the movie, Ron actually helps Harry to get through one of the dangerous rounds of the contest where the four students had to compete underwater. Ron's actions actually saved Harry's life. This part of the stories highlights the resilience of true friendship. No matter how significant the misunderstanding is, true friends will still help each other when in need and resolve the problem between them. Then when the four enter the last round of the tournament, the maze, Cedric encounters a minion of Voldemort, he is murdered by the killing curse. Then, Harry is captured by the other underlings of Voldemort. His arm is cut, and his blood collected to revive Voldemort. Harry has to duel against him for his life. He almost loses against the newly rejuvenated and strengthened Dark Lord. However, the souls of Harry's loved ones who were murdered by Voldemort appear from Voldemort's wand and give Harry's time to get to the Portkey to escape the maze. This scene demonstrates the theme of love's triumph over hate and evil. Critique: I love this movie and the whole Harry Potter series as a whole. There are, nonetheless, certain details that I think can be improved upon. The first one is rather a minor detail. It is when Dumbledore finds out the Goblet of Fire has chosen Harry as the fourth selectee to enter the tournament. The book says that Dumbledore ‘calmly' asks Harry if he actually put his name into the Goblet. However, the corresponding scene in the movie portraits Dumbledore's asking as aggressive and intimidating when he grabs Harry's arms and shakes them while questioning him. This minor detail, although does not affect the structural integrity of the storyline, somehow momentarily breaks the usual portrayal of Dumbledore as a gathered and calm man without serving any significant purpose. The second detail is when Harry is forced to enter the Tournament. J.K Rowling here could have better explained why it is that way, because the audience may have questions such as the following: Why is an underage forced to enter such a perilous contest even when he does not want to? Or Why can't/doesn't the administration do anything to keep Harry from the having to enter? Explanations to these questions can further strengthen the integral structure of the storyline. Overall, despite these small details that may be improved, I still give the movie 5 out of 5 stars.",Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Movie Reviews

2329,Leobardo V,4d ago,"The worst movie out of the trilogy, but really over hated. The reasons why people hate this movie is understandable, Peter Parker seems to have regressed on his love life which was developed and was seemed to be great as how the second movie ended, but in this film Peter Parker makes some decisions that make him a bad person when it comes to love and makes Mary Jane Watson feel not feel appreciated. Mary Jane Watson story is really not that good in this film they make her really dependent of a guy which in the comics, video-games, and TV shows/cartoons Mary Jane has always been an independent woman that takes care of herself most of the time. Villain wise this movie is also mid, out of the 3 villains, we only had one going into detail of why he was bad and why he took some decisions that made him a villain but only one had great character development and that was Sandman, for the other villain (New Green Goblin) we have had a background story of why he became a villain since the first film but to be fair they did do a good gob towards the end when it comes to that character. The main villain and the worst one is Venom, man came out of nowhere and managed to get into Peter Parker's apartment so easily without him realizing. Venom was a rushed character in this film, no background, man just landed on Earth from space and he only turned Peter Parker more into an anti-hero when Peter was his host but no interactions between Peter and Venom, also something to add, Venom turned into a suit which Peter easily took off and when Peter realized what was happening to him with Venom he struggles to take off his suit, makes no sense to me unless Venom realized Peter wanted him away so he just tried to stay with him. Once Venom reached Eddie Brook, it was more comic accurate but still a wasted villain nothing compared to the new Venom movies we have today. This movie is enjoyable but it is average at best compared to the other films.",Spider-Man 3,Spider-Man 3 - Movie Reviews
2330,Aidan B,5d ago,"A massive disappointment compared to the classic first two, ""Spiderman 3"" has a much shakier and convoluted story that tries to cram too much into its short runtime. The action is still pleasant, though the CGI somehow feels worse than the previous films. The villains are still good and memorable, though there are just too many to give any of them their time to shine. The direction that this film heads in is also very confusing, rewriting some important plot points and actions of the previous two films. Maguire, Dunst, and Franco are still very well in this movie though, and the acting of the villains is also on point. There are also a number of entertaining sequences, though most get overshadowed by the large amount of cringey and unnecessarily bad moments that make no sense. Overall, just a bad film that fails to conclude the ending that the previous installments deserved.",Spider-Man 3,Spider-Man 3 - Movie Reviews
2331,Martin F,6d ago,"The trilogy ends on a confusing note. It's a really hard film to follow, there is so many stories here and all of them seems underdeveloped. The characters development which was what I preferred in the first two movies, doesn't feel relatable anymore outside few moments (most of the time during the scenes with Aunt Jay, the voice of reason). The big point of the movie was adapting the Venom arc, and the movie fails in every way. Venom feels very secondary, I would even say that if you remove everything about him the movie would be as ""coherent"" that it is. I know it's ""iconic"" now in a too bad is good kind of way, but for me the Peter Parker/Venom scenes was a secondhand embarrassment. I felt bad for the characters and I even felt bad for Tobey Maguire having to play these scenes. It's simply cringe. The special effects sometimes feel too ambitious for the time, they go overboard with the action scenes giving you tense moment but very noticeable green screens or CGI. It was a time where we qualify action movies as CGI messes and Spider-man 3 is the perfect example. The end is a little too cheesy and too easy.",Spider-Man 3,Spider-Man 3 - Movie Reviews

2333,Liam B,"Nov 15, 2021","I don't think there is a person out there that believes this is the best film in the trilogy. While it turns Spider-Man in a direction that I don't particularly like, I still find that this film shows some of the charm of the first two. I can tell this film was made with care and love, but I can also tell that the studio got their hands on it and turned, what I'm sure was a great plan from Sam Raimi, into a mess of too many villains and plots. I would have love to have seen a movie with Just Harry as the Green Goblin or Just the Sandman. I don't like the inclusion of Venom in the slightest, to me, Toby's Spider-Man is supposed to be a great lighthearted guy, the ultimate nice/good guy, and I loved that. But, the symbiote turns Toby into a dark individual that I don't think fits the series. For example, The Spider-Man from the 90's animated series was a great Spider-Man to use the symbiote with. While he was a great guy, and one of my favorite Spider-Men ever, he wasn't the ultimate nice guy that Toby's Spider-Man was on the big screen. They used the symbiote much earlier in his arc, season 1 of a 5 season show, at a time when he was still arrogant and immature, as opposed to a Spider-Man who had already progressed through 2 films. The version of Spider-Man in the animated series was much more self-centered and was a much better match for the symbiote. Overall, I like this movie, but I don't like Peter for some of it, and a can't help to think what could have been.",Spider-Man 3,Spider-Man 3 - Movie Reviews

2341,Jonathan K,"Oct 09, 2021","Honestly this movie isn't nearly as terrible as a lot of people claim - it's just a movie where the desires of the talented filmmakers were overridden by those of an executive. Primarily, Sam Raimi, the brilliant filmmaker who made the first two (in addition to the wonderful Evil Dead trilogy) did not want to make a Venom movie, as he considered Venom a boring villain, but the studio forced his hand to do it anyway. And as such, this is a movie made by instruction, made be a director that made the preceding entries out of passion. Combine this with some numerous production complications and self-proclaimed genius Danny Elfman refusing to write the music because he felt Raimi didn't appreciate his unbridled genius, and you've got a movie with massive, massive problems just due to happenstance. And it's actually rather sad, as much about the movie actually works very well -- The climax is hugely entertaining and ends with a moment of resolve, rather than defeat, the way Peter finally stands against Harry are actually quite cathartic, and the new Composer's musical score is much better than the forgettable-at-best fluff that we got from the previous two movies (as let's be real - the wonderful main theme was the only piece of music from the first two movies worth listening to). There's some efficient (yet widely misunderstood) comedy bits in this movie, and it is interesting to see not only Parker himself becoming increasingly violent, but one of the main villains increasingly, of his own accord, becomes a more and more volatile person, making him a good villain. If you loved the first two I'd ultimately recommend this one - the only real reason I hesitate is that there are some depressing ""my dreams never came true"" beats that come up during the story, but so long as you acknowledge that it's not nearly as good.",Spider-Man 3,Spider-Man 3 - Movie Reviews

Despite the cast (the only good actors are Rosemary Harris, JK Simmons and James Franco), the villains are good. There is more action in this movie than in the other two combined, and I loved it because Peter Parker's arc was something I always felt bored watching. And this film is more than an emo Peter Parker. This emo Peter makes sense, I finally managed to have empathy for the protagonist, and the conclusion is perfect and touching. I ended the film proud of Peter. Finally, if I said the first film isn't that good, and the second one is good but overrated, this third one is underrated and deserves more than a ""cult"" status.",Spider-Man 3,Spider-Man 3 - Movie Reviews

2351,Sean L,"Sep 21, 2021","At the onset of his third big-picture treatment, we find young Peter Parker in an unfamiliar predicament: he's genuinely happy! Almost annoyingly so, in fact. Even his longtime love interest, Mary Jane Watson, seems to think he's laying it on too thick and tries to tell him as much in a series of awkward, abbreviated conversations between crime-fighting bouts. Parker pays no mind, of course, produces a string of awful motivational speeches when she needs emotional support and swiftly swings himself straight back onto the singles scene. Well, that didn't take long. Now Spidey is sad again! Just in time to tangle with three(!) competing super-villains, a rival in the workplace and a major league identity crisis. Not unlike its predecessors, Spider-Man 3 has way too much going on, a problem that's ballooned with each subsequent installment. The first two films manage to succeed in spite of this weakness, persevering with a great shared cast, strong character moments and well-earned payoffs. In those films, Pete's best pal Harry Osborn slowly works his way through a patient, simmering villainous turn. Here, he's abruptly hot-shotted in the opening action scene, carelessly reset and cast aside until the finale. Venom is birthed and dispensed in less than an act. Sandman's arc has enough emotional heft to single-handedly carry the counter narrative, but he always feels like a third wheel. Gwen Stacey pops in and out of the frame at random. There's just no room for these subplots to breathe amidst all the frantic competition, the race to grab every last thread and hurriedly weave them into something loosely resembling a story. Maybe with a touch of nuance and panache, a skilled director could have worked a little magic and turned this troubled script into an acceptable early-period superhero flick. Sam Raimi is anything but a nuanced director. At best, he's capable but limited, habitually caught in the act of winking at his own shortcomings in uniquely entertaining ways. No wonder he's best regarded for his gleefully deranged horror movies, where over-stressed people behave irrationally (and a little comically) in high-pressure situations. Under ideal circumstances, he can incorporate his eccentricities into the fabric of a film without negatively affecting its story, but not with so many other jobs on his plate. I'm not sure if the hammy over-acting is his fault or the stars', but I tend to lean toward the former because it's so hopelessly widespread. Nothing feels natural in this film, from the janky dialogue and clumsy delivery to the rushed primary character arc and dated special effects. I can still remember how this felt in the theater, bad enough that I avoided revisiting it for nearly fifteen years, and it hasn't improved with time. I can see bits and pieces of promise dotted here and there, hints that the overachieving Spider-Man 2 wasn't just a fluke, but they're drowned by the hurry to expand an already-crowded universe and get everything back to an unconvincing status quo in time for the closing credits.

2364,Cailan D,"Aug 06, 2021","In many ways, Spider-Man 3 is structurally the same as its two predecessors: Peter starts out the movie as Spider-Man and the villains, who aren't inherently villains, become so as the movie progresses. The biggest difference this time is that there are two villains rather than one and Peter plays a big part in why the villains are fighting him. In many ways, this same structure works to the film's benefit and gives us some interesting characters and nice action sequences. It's another example of if a system isn't broken, don't fix it. SM 3 also adds a lot of depth to Peter's relationships with those around him, which becomes especially important as Peter changes throughout the film in pretty drastic ways that have big consequences for him. SM 3 is a movie that exemplifies that concept that you can be your own worst enemy. The acting is pretty good overall, although there is a casting choice that to this day I'm not a big fan of. The effects in the movie have slightly raised the bar from the previous films, making this a slight improvement from SM and SM 2. All that said, SM 3 is a bit of a letdown and isn't as good as the other two. Many scenes lack the directorial and written finesse than they had in the first two which causes some scenes to feel really awkward and a bit disruptive to the flow of the film. The dialogue is a bit cheesy at times and there are some scenes that don't make a lot of sense. Sandman and Venom are decent villains but they aren't quite as good as Green Goblin and Doc Ock were, which is partially because they come from different plotlines so there isn't as much time to develop their characters as there would optimally be. One of the biggest issues of SM 3 is exactly that: there are a bunch of storylines going on at once so the movie doesn't have a clear and direct focus for a lot of its runtime, so certain things don't get the development they deserve. The film balances all these stories as well as it can and overall does a decent job, but there are things that could've been explored a bit more. The ending has an emotional punch to it to nicely caps off the trilogy and should leave viewers satisfied enough as the credits roll. SM 3 is undoubtedly a letdown from its two predecessors but is a decent enough movie to be watchable and enjoyable at times.",Spider-Man 3,Spider-Man 3 - Movie Reviews

I recommend Casino Royale, Skyfall and No Time To Die when it comes to a typical binge on the Daniel Craig Bond movies and recommend Quantum Of Solace and SPECTRE just once.

2414,Patrick D,"Nov 20, 2021",So overall I like the movie but it could have been so much better. I just think they try to tie things in way too much with this.

2415,Luke J,"Nov 17, 2021","Spectre is an entertaining and overlong spy thriller. Although it fails to reach the heights of Casino Royal or Skyfall- Spectre is a watchable, and often quite fun Bond movie. The action is great, cinematography is beautiful, performances are generally good, but the writing is fairly sloppy. Trying to have Blofeld become the one behind all of Bond's previous troubles is clearly retconning- and doesn't work great. Having Blofeld be Bond's jealous step-brother is just plain stupid- how would Bond not recognize someone he grew up with? The pacing is also a big problem. The opening is great with an amazing tracking shot followed by great action. In the middle act things slow down considerably, and the story isn't engaging enough to warrant it. Then the final act tries to squeeze in too much, and despite some great action it is jarring the way things jump from one event to the next so abruptly. It waits until the last 40 minutes to finally reveal the villain and have him interact with Bond- then we get an extended monologue, torture scene, and escape scene within a less than 20 minutes or less. The way Bond goes from having his brain scrambled to moments later being a deadeye shot, blowing up the entire base and escaping- is just silly and shows how carelessly some of the sequences were put together. There are a handful of other times where the logic just doesn't add up. Walken delivers a very hammy performance as Blofeld, a totally cartoonish villain when compared against previous Craig- Bond villains. All that said- this is a Bond movie with lots of style, great action, exotic locals, beautiful women, wonderful camera work, and a solid central performance by Craig (who is easily my favorite Bond).",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

2418,Toby H,"Nov 14, 2021","Spectre is another entertaining and engaging Craig outing, even if a slight step back from Skyfall. Watch it for Waltz, he's as masterful as ever. We're glad Craig opted to avoid any ghosts and do one more.",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews
2419,Stefan Z,"Nov 13, 2021","Ah yes, the one that thinks it's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, but is actually Austin Powers in Goldmember. This is definitely a goofy Bond movie masquerading as serious one. I actually watched this twice in the theatres when it came out. That's how much I loved it at the time. I now know I was forcing myself to accept the glaring awful writing. I never particularly liked the writing even back then, but justified liking it for other aspects like directing, cinematography, musical score, action set pieces, and having the best costume design in the series. That last one I still believe. Just like how the jarring editing in tandem with poor blocking weighs the overall quality of Quantum of Solace down, so too does the writing of Spectre. Skyfall had some ridiculous plot holes as well but there were other aspects of the writing keeping it from being a totally trash script unlike this one. Thomas Newman's score is even better than I remember. I think I might even prefer it to his Skyfall score. However, the cinematography is way worse. For some reason I thought the super saturated sepia filter was present only in the cold open in Mexico, which would be bad enough, but it's like that throughout the film. Not a fan ever usually of sepia and here its at a whole other tier. I do really like Bautista's character. One of my favourite henchman honestly. The Austin Martin DB10 is one of my favourite Bond cars ever. It's number one of the modern cars (modern equals Brosnan and Craig eras). The car chase in Rome is decent, not as bad as some die hard fans say it is. I liked it. I would have preferred Rome be in winter to somewhat try to justify the lack of traffic. There definitely were some vehicles in the way, but perhaps not enough. Back to the writing. The C stuff that M is dealing with makes no sense. Dont they already have information on everyone? What exactly is going to change with having more of it? The Blofeld stuff makes absolutely no sense. Brothers? Seriously? not only is that bad by itself, it makes the world of of the entire series so much smaller. Bond also has to deal with him on his own by the end. Where is the rest of all his minions? and why in the old MI6 building? How did Bond shoot down a plane with a pistol (ok that one I always had a problem with, but now with everything else, it just feels even worse. When were they (Bond and Madeline) falling in love exactly? Because it wasn't in this movie. Speaking of which, never in this series have I seen more nonsensical reasons for having sex since The Man with the Golden Gun. Neither times did it feel appropriate. One of them was done for laughs and I wasn't laughing. some jokes actually do work though, the writing isn't absolute garbage. I like Q and a lot of his lines, most of the time. I like the Sam Smith theme song less and less every time I hear it. When it first came out, I loved it, was in my top 5 of all Bond themes. By now it's somewhere close to the bottom 5 for me if not already there. The graphic of the theme song is probably even worse honestly. Some weird shadows over people's faces going on. The cold open isn't even as great as I remember. No only is the sepia filter so overbearingly distracting, the first cut from the long take happens at a pretty random and awkward moment.",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

2422,Jean L,"Oct 30, 2021",Spectre continues the story of Daniel Craig as James Bond and unfortunately is not one of the strongest instalments of this franchise. In here James Bond is tested by one of its toughest opponents yet Ernst Blofeld played by Christoph Waltz who is set to take over all the intelligence agencies of the world and make the world bow to him through an organization called Spectre. Craig here continues to kick ass and in here is struggling with the passing of M as played by Judy Dench. Now the mantle is taken over by the great Ralph Fiennes who is not as caring as Dench's M but is more stern and direct and gets in more sparring moments with Bond. The meat of the story though is the '' Bond Female'' played by the great French actress Lea Seydoux of Blue is the Warmest color fame. This is the best female character for this franchise since Casino Royale and establishes a romance that has great consequences for the story. Unfortunately even with Sam Mendes back as director this movie pales in comparison to Skyfall. Is convoluted with a very long dull pace and despite the great performance by Waltz this villain is quite disappointing with a very disappointing climax. This film could have been so much better,Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

Blofeld, played by Christoph Waltz, is kinda wasted in the movie, which is disappointing because Waltz is such a masterful actor and he could have had a much larger presence in the movie.

2429,Nathan D,"Oct 10, 2021","Spectre is satisfactory with a lot of elements that hold up throughout the whole film. Yet, several components get lost in the story that is not to the capacity it should be at. The story is flawed and does not flow right. This problem is apparent in the character arc of the villain. Just like Quantum of Solace, Spectre handles its villain terribly. Ernst Stavro Blofeld's story is so muddled with very little explanation. There is a lot of verbal exposition, but never any visual storytelling. Blofeld's storyline is a victim of this problem as the film had a near 150-minute screen duration yet can not show any relevant information. However, the film can get one of the Bond girls right and not just have Léa Seydoux be the sexual one-off that Monica Bellucci is. Speaking of Bellucci, she is part of a weak opening. Bellucci should have never been in the movie since her character is a misfire. Spectre is the fourth film in this version of the franchise, and the filmmakers should know that they need to treat their characters better. The film also has a mixed bag in the technical aspects of the film. The cinematography is bland, with hardly any shots that are visually appealing. The film uses the hand-held camera too much and focuses on the wrong details. One of those two problems is more at the fault of Sam Mendes as his directing is a step-down from Skyfall. Mendes does not fulfill the concept and story of this movie in an orderly fashion. There are various moments in the film where it feels like a parody of a Bond movie that you would see on a sketch show. The cast is at fault here with some weak performances from multiple actors. Daniel Craig is at his lowest point in Spectre with a very emotionless performance. Craig delivered this fun cockiness in the other films, but here he exhibits a bland personality. Christoph Waltz is solid, yet it is hard to see the range of his character when Waltz has very little screen time. Léa Seydoux is also a decent actor in the ensemble, and it was nice to see that she had a strong sense of emotion in times of uncertainty. Dave Bautista is a prominent addition to the cast and adds some much-needed variety to the film. Ben Whishaw is a delight in the role Q, yet he was missing that spark that he had in Skyfall. Lastly, there is Ralph Fiennes. Fiennes is excellent as M, and it was nice to see M expanded on with Fiennes making him a more likable character. Spectre is a misfire in the James Bond franchise, yet does have a few redeeming qualities in some of its departments. The story has a few bumps, and Sam Mendes is not doing the best work he can. However, Spectre is watchable as that is one highlighting aspect with any of these James Bond movies. Read more reviews like this at postcreditreviews.com",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

2435,David M,"Oct 08, 2021","Like Quantum Of Solace, this is a film that is destined to suffer by virtue of being a sequel to its predecessor; in this film's sake, to possibly the best Bond film of them all. Once again like Quantum of Solace, this film benefits from revisiting long after initial release; though the action sequences and the over-arching plot are closer to the entertainingly over-the-top traditions of much earlier in the series, this is never over-egged. The balance is in fact just about right, and there are moments of direction and design that provide a visual impact that's quite unlike much I can remember in any other film in the series. It is too long - when Bond says 'this isn't over yet just' before we cut to the film's denouement from what we all expected to be the denouement when we saw it first time around, it's tempting to find yourself saying 'Really?'. The 4 (or will it be 5?) film arc of the plot requires this extra ending and whilst it does mean the film outstays its welcome a little, it's an undeniably well-executed final finale. That there are at least 2 Daniel Craig Bond films better than this (I'm writing this before seeing No Time To Die) could sound like a criticism, but on its own terms and with the benefit of time, this is a comfortable success.",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

It's not a great film, but I'd argue better than this one. Worse yet, this film is overlong and slow as sin. There's a couple of good action sequences, the cast is good, and treating it's female lead as more than it's male leads disposable condom are all great. The cinematography is decent too, but all this is wasted with the stupid twist done decades earlier and better in the film mentioned earlier, as well as a tendency to become formulaic, which HORRIFIES me. I HATE what this movie does to this movie's villain. It's too nostalgia-baity and pandering. I give this a 4/10. I'm scared No Time To Die might be just as unoriginally stupid from what I've heard.

2443,Lequisha S,"Oct 05, 2021","They legitimately borrowed an Austin Powers Goldmember plot point with their hackneyed attempt at creating emotional resonance between Bond and Christoph Waltz' blofeld. This movie recycled so much from previous films in the Craig era. It tried to give 007 a Bond girl that he truly cared for, but there was none of the chemistry and flair Casino Royale had in the Bond-Vesper relationship. It tried to do the secret organization pulling the strings bit that Quantum of Solace did with Mr. White and the Quantum organization. It tried to do the villain-has-personal-attachment-to-Bond thing that Skyfall did. And on all three fronts, it failed miserably. Worst of all, there were so many dull points in the movie. If you won't have the depth or subversiveness of the better Bond entries, at least have interesting action.",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

I thought the action, as in pretty much all Bond films, was the standout for me. The train sequence was brilliantly choreographed and the climatic scene added some spectacular set piece action that will be etched into the Bond archives. Performance wise all good as expected once more, however Christoph Waltz as the films leading antagonist provided his usual demonic demeanour and his appreance weaves nicely into the narrative that had been building through the films prior to Spectre. This certainly does no harm to a group of films that has built itself up, especially since Craig has been at the helm, as one of the best action franchises of all time.",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

2447,MSBReviews .,"Sep 29, 2021","Rating: B ""Spectre fails to reach the tremendous potential of its intriguing narrative and fascinating antagonist, but Sam Mendes still pulls off a decent James Bond flick. The screenplay raises significant issues with an incredibly dull subplot that deeply affects the pacing of a bloated runtime. In addition to this, Christoph Waltz's lack of impactful screentime is disappointing, to say the least, despite a brilliant performance from the actor. Fortunately, the jaw-dropping action set pieces elevate the overall film, which also benefits from gorgeous cinematography (Hoyte van Hoytema) and exceptional acting across the board. Daniel Craig and Léa Seydoux's characters relationship is emotionally compelling, making Bond's mission feel more like an interesting personal journey. One of the best movies of the franchise is buried somewhere under the messy screenplay, but what can be found at the surface has much to appreciate.""",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

The pacing was atrocious, especially because I feel like they could have ended it at the two hour mark, with slight modifications, if any, and called it there. Hey, they brought back other Bond tropes I didn't like, such as storylines just being dropped and never brought back up again. The characters are also a bit flat this time around, the soundtrack's kind of generic, and Daniel Craig is as mumbly as ever, but he does deliver on the actions scenes, so he's done a solid job overall making this his Bond. The visual effects were well done, with neither distracting CGI of most modern blockbusters, nor the awkward mistakes of the 60s/70s/80s. The comic relief is good, and at the end of the day, this is still more interesting than some of the worst ones of the 70s and 80s. I'm really hoping the quality of Skyfall returns, like Bond has 24 times now. I will say, however, the surveillance stuff was timely commentary for 2015 the way Tomorrow Never Dies' was in 1997, and to this day for both, so they were at least trying.",SHOW MORE,Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

Tom Holland does very well in his portrayal of both Spiderman and Peter Parker, and the villain, played by Michael Keaton, is one of the more memorable villains in the MCU. However, the main issue I have with this film is that Spiderman never feels like his own hero, just like Tony Stark's shadow, up until the end of course. Even the villain, however, doesn't even have any conflict with Peter, he just feels like a villain that would fight against the Avengers, or more specifically, Tony Stark. I feel like the film relied too much on Tony Stark and never came out of his shadow. The film in general, however, was still fun to watch and it's one that I've seen several times, it's just that there are a few issues that I have with it.",Spider-Man: Homecoming,Spider-Man: Homecoming - Movie Reviews

2464,Rafael R,"Oct 28, 2021","My favourite Spider-Man movie. Tom Holland's version of the hero is the most human between the main trio (him, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield). He's a real teenager: anxious, acts by impulse, he's the Spider-Man who most want to be a hero. Most people complain that Tony Stark replaced Uncle Ben in MCU. I completely disagree. When Peter met Tony he already was Spider-Man by around six months. Uncle Ben has already died and Stark was someone who gave Peter a purpose. His turnaround sentence is the best I saw in a Spider-Man movie. But a Spider-Man movie isn't only made of Spider-Man. We have Peter Parker's arc outside the suit as well. And it's excellent. The high school environment looks like a high school environment (the best friend, the bully, the crush, the cynical, everyone is here and they're great characters) and Tom Holland is the most charismatic and trustworthy Peter Parker (as a teenager, he looks and acts like one) and his chemistry with Laura Harrier (Liz) is undeniably cute. Finally, Vulture is an excellent villain: he's imposing, has a motivation that makes sense, and despite not having Spider-Man as a direct enemy, is a person who is next to Peter and had the superhero interfering in his plans. My only issue with this movie is Aunt May, who is constantly treated like a MILF, and that joke is the only one that is repetitive and never works. It's sad because Marisa Tomei is a good actress and has the perfect age-looking for the role.",Spider-Man: Homecoming,Spider-Man: Homecoming - Movie Reviews

2472,Marco B,"Sep 16, 2021","Spider-Man finally gets a full length MCU treatment in this (sort-of) reboot to the franchise. Tom Holland is probably the most accurate portrayal of our young hero, Peter Parker, as he deals with the after math of working with Iron Man's Avengers (see Civil War). Peter is an easy-going fun loving kid who wants the girl, to impress Tony Stark, and to be popular. The positive in this film is that it is a real coming of age tale with a kid trying to deal with being a kid. Even our villain, The Vulture, is excellently played by (my favourite Batman) Michael Keaton, who has less of a plan and is just plain greedy. This film suffered from a lack of consequences as Peter has nothing really to lose, only his potential position in the Avengers, which isn't that big a deal. The other problem with this film is it can't decide whether it's a teen flick, action movie, coming of age tale or an origin story. Because of this, the plot and pacing can be off at times, but the acting makes up for this as Spidey really shines through.",Spider-Man: Homecoming,Spider-Man: Homecoming - Movie Reviews

Of course that's not putting down the brilliant Spider-Man 2 from Sam Rami, however this movie is the one I gravitate towards when wanting to put on a Spider-Man film. The Amazing cast really helps push the movie to a higher level with 'Tom Holland' playing Peter Parker/Spider-Man this is the first time I actually believed the actor could actually be in high school whereas former iterations who looked in there mid 20s. Tom Holland to me plays both Spider-Man & Peter brilliantly with Michael Keaton also doing a superb job as the movies villain 'The Vulture' Michael manages to make you feel bad and understand the character one moment then makes you fear him the next, You have to give props to the actor when his powerless character is threatening a superhuman and you are actually worried for the latter.

2475,Stephy S,"Sep 04, 2021","An action-packed coming of age story full of laughs and engaging fight sequences, Spider-Man Homecoming is a cheesy story that doesn't take itself too seriously but still makes time for heartfelt scenes that show who Peter Parker is as a person. The CGI from Marvel is phenomenal, as to be expected. The plot is your average light hearted Marvel plot and it works about as well as you'd expect, the writing isn't some magnum opus but it's decent enough for it to be forgiven. The cast is however a bit hit or miss, Robert Downey Jr is charismatic and a blast as always and Michael Keaton is insidious and one of the better Marvel villains, but we can't speak about the cast without talking about its rendition of Spider-man aka Peter Parker. Tom Holland is truly fantastic, he's cheesy, he's quippy, he's charming, he's everything you could ever want out of a Spider-Man, and most importantly, he's having fun in the role. Unfortunately, outside of these three, the rest of the cast is pretty forgettable. The pacing while at times too fast is never terrible.

It became more complicated with more mystery and unpredictable twists. The threat was more alarming and prominent to the whole school. There was also a bigger danger to Harry and his trio, which made me more invested in them. Even though I was more interested in the story, the run time was a big issue.

2529,Puroo R,"May 08, 2021","After watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone I had gotten really high hopes for the Harry Potter franchise. I was expecting all of them to be as simplistic and visually appealing as that movie. With that in mind I watched the second movie today and sadly, it doesn't live up to the mark on almost any of the parameters. That's not to say that it's a bad movie. It's not. But it's not a good Harry Potter movie. To begin with, the movie's CGI hasn't aged pretty well. And that's actually really surprising because the first one was so good so this one should have had a higher budget and thus more advanced VFX. But other than the Basilisk, most of the CGI hasn't aged so well. Especially that of Dobby. When he was banging his head in the drawer in the beginning of the movie, the shelves of the drawer were shaking in the opposite direction of where they should shake. And when Harry puts Dobby in the wardrobe it looked more like the wind is opening the door instead of Dobby. There are plenty of examples of bad CGI in the movie but I don't want to take it too far. Speaking of Dobby, he's had a very bad introduction. The way he is behaving is annoying. If I were to behave like that my mom would have slapped me all across the face. Sure he does get a wholesome ending, but that's yet to see how he turns out. Draco also became more annoying now, with constantly trying to bully Harry even though he can't do a thing. Myrtle spoke like a nerd Harley Quinn. I get this movie is trying to be campy, but that goes way too far. The story is a good part here. Although it's not as easy as Sorcerer's Stone, it is still very nicely detailed. Too many incidents happen in it, but yet it does not feel bloated. It feels absolutely to the point, with none of that ""side quest"" things movies often use to pad the runtime. Everything happens for a reason and it all pays off in the end. The scenes with Ron, particularly in the beginning, are always funny and memorable. Though Hermione doesn't play as huge part in this movie as Harry and Ron do, she also gets a decent screen time, although without any character arc. I'm still on the second movie of this franchise, so I can't exactly say if this is among the good movies or the bad ones. But I really hope the rest of the movies are more leaning towards the first one in terms of tone. I remember every scene right now, but I can see myself forgetting most of the parts in the next few months.",Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - Movie Reviews

2577,Jacob J D,"Jun 28, 2021","""The Secret Life of Pets 2"" was made to teach new parents a lesson Sometimes I feel like Max, the Jack Russell Terrier. As much as I want to be like Rooster, the cool and collective sheepdog, sometimes my nervous and over-protective energy can get the best of me as most new parents have realize in the beginning years. As if Illumination was thinking of me when producing the script, they decided to name the baby Max is zealously protecting over as Liam my own toddler's name. I was only expecting childish fun gags and witty observations about the animals that rule our lives. Never thought the film's moral compass was to make me feel less alone with Max complaining ""why is the world so dangerous"" as I try to prevent my little ones from hitting themselves into pesky edges in our household. True, this theme is a minor element in this entertaining, energetic, and humorous sequel that should satisfy fans of the original. However, being present in the most important subplot reminded me that the most important lessons can come from unexpected places. As Rooster (perfect voice casting portraying the gruff, aloof, grit, and authenticity of Harrison Ford) said to Max after he reflected paranoia of Liam possibly falling, ""so what if he falls? He will just get back up."" It's a perfect metaphor that we can't protect our kids at all times forever, to let them go to grow experimenting as Max put it in the end this ""complex, scary and beautiful world."" Following the model example of Rooster, Max learns to face his own fears giving an example of bravery and courage as a result to Liam. Of course, most people are not going in seeking out these themes in this animated feature rather a visual vibrant, well-pace, and fun time that doesn't outstay its welcome. This film hit that mark overall even feeling more so like an episodic Saturday cartoon. I say that because the structure is unusual considering there is three subplots that feels like three separate episodes that in the end interconnect for a finale. This lack of lasered focus linear structured plot results in a thin story that questions if a sequel only exits simply because its predecessor was a box office success. Nevertheless, at least the themes and lessons learned mentioned earlier intertwines with the three main characters in the final act. At times it seems a bit mature for the younger audience with multiple suspenseful tense scenes however even my toddler son took it well as if he were inspired to become Rooster himself. The voice cast is pitch perfect and strong all around that brings relevance and charm to these characters that will support a healthy fan base looking forward to the next entry. Thank you for the lesson Harrison Ford.",The Secret Life of Pets,The Secret Life of Pets 2 - Movie Reviews

Anyone who knows psychology or who has suffered recovering from mental illness knows that kind all-to-common action gets people killed. I can't help but remember a friend who introduced me to that movie who during that exact scene and said, ""I like that dog."" ... as he refused to awknowledge or respect a mental illness his daughter was struggling with; and was just exacerbating her condition. It could have been a decent feel-good movie if it hadn't had that scene. But that scene turned it from a potential tool for healing and recovery to slipping glass shards in the medicine bottle.

2611,Late R,"May 24, 2020","‘The Secret Life of Pets' was a pretty average animated film whose ""what do our pets get up to when we're not around"" premise made it relatable, funny and charming to pet owners/lovers. The sequel has practically nothing to do with its title anymore (you can only pull that trick once, after all) and loses anything that made it somewhat original. Now we're into very familiar animated-animal territory that we've all seen many times before. Sure, there are some good messages (albeit very standard stuff) and a few things that'll probably make you smile, but for the most part, as with its predecessor, it's not particularly memorable and, in fact, the most stand-out thing is the colourful animation (the backgrounds are lovely) and character design. In short, kids might enjoy it and there are a few moments that might catch your attention, but for most adults, there's not much here.",The Secret Life of Pets,The Secret Life of Pets 2 - Movie Reviews

2648,V T,"Oct 01, 2021","I've watched the movie for a total of 4 times and let me tell you something (two times on HBO and 2 second more on a pirate site): The movie is utterly garbage and unbearable to watch, even with the Utimate Cut. Till now, i still don't know why people are praising a poorly-written movie with extremely low pacing and dogshit performances, maybe because everyone can have diferrent opinions about a subjective subject i guess. Nonetheless, the movie is still something worth to be buried somewhere else outside of this world, far from our reach. There are many problems with the movie, but the biggest problem of all was the plot. It was just unbelievably stupid and corny, left the Martha scene alone. Don't get me wrong, i don't have any personal hate on Snyder but this movie is just something else beyond the conception of intelligence. I refuse to think that this was made by a decent human being. It's like watching a Neil Breen movie for Christ sake, everything is completely a trainwrecking mess. None of the details in it made sense in a way that a nornal mind can conprehend; how can a hateful, violent, gruesome vilgilante somehow found a immigrant alien to be hostile and then spare him the moment he knew that they had the same mother's name? Oh yeah, i know why, because the movie didn't bother to consider the logical thinking of the plot or the self-development of the characters that involved in it so they just did what they thought that be the (least) logical thing to ease the discord between the two. To summarise all of it in one sentence: it's a plain stupid movie.",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice - Movie Reviews

Surely there has to be more to it than that for such big names as Affleck, Fishburne, Adams. Et Al. The directing is amongst the most hopelessly muddled that I've ever seen in my 65+ years of cinema involvement. (My father was a cinema manager, so that had a bearing on me seeing far, far more movies all through my youth than my contemporaries who had to buy their seats.). But this thing would have had me desirous of a rebate, especially bearing in mind the price of cinema tickets these days, (my days of freebie tickets ended - unfortunately - about thirty years back) The screenplay and dialogue is poor, poor stuff indeed. And - Superman as, effective,y, - a villain? What? I'm reduced to using terms not unrelated to those of abuse in another circumstance. It is crap, it is junk, it is unwatchable dross. Don't buy the DVD, but by all means if you're curious to see how bad a flick Hollywood is capable of turning out despite a vast budget, check it on Amazon Video.

The action scenes sometimes work (the underwater opener and the man v tank showdown) but some are just over the top craziness.

2657,Taekwondo Life M,"Mar 18, 2021","Everything about this sequel to Wolf Warrior exceeds the first. The acting, the special effects, the story- all an improvement over the original installment. Wu Jing returns in this sequel. He also wrote, produced, and directed the film. The film surrounds Wu Jing's attempt to live a peaceful life in Africa when he his peace is disrupted by a mercenary army and a deadly disease outbreak. One of my criticisms of the first film was that I did not feel Wu Jing commanded the screen as the lead. Nothing could be further from the truth in this one. Rather than playing a Jackie Chan-esq character, Wu King finds his own as a compelling, interesting, and exciting action star in this one. He is very good. As for the supporting cast- Frank Grillo is always fun to watch. He appears to be the hardest working action star/character in the world. His fight with Jing in the finale of the film is well choreographed. Celina Jade is commanding as the love interest. Nwachukwu Kennedy Chukwuebuka steals every scene he is in as Jing's ""Godson"". This movie was one of the highest grossing pictures of all time. Sam Hargrave, martial artist, stuntman, and Director of the highly successful ""Extraction, stunt choreographed the underwater fight as well as many of the action scenes. This explains a lot about its success. This one is worth watching. The ending foreshadows a ""Part 3"" and I hope it is at least as good as the sequel.",Wolf Warrior 2,Wolf Warrior II - Movie Reviews
2658,Jonathan K,"Jan 19, 2021","In terms of production and narrative machinations, this is a far more complicated movie than its predecessor, so props to Wu Jing on his Directing of this film to have it work; it's not some of the best Directing you'll see by any stretch (the acting is mediocre and some of the cinematography is really rather bland), but it flows and it functions without any actual structural problems, which most certainly isn't nothing. People came to watch Action, and this movie Stars and is Directed by one of the most underappreciated Action stars working today. As such, the action is almost always from Good to Excellent, and the story-beats, while somewhat thread-bare, are enough to keep the momentum up. I was also shocked as to how much had actually happened by the end of the movie, as the amount crammed into the movie feels like it was a full hour longer (not a complaint, just an observation), as it ends with a prolonged fight scene that ends up with him battling a tank. The movie does often times come off as a bit pretentious at times, as it features heroes protecting unarmed citizens from trigger-happy killers, but it really just boils down to being an excuse to have some really cool action sequences; the movie does make you empathize for the refugees, but their part in the movie is really just a trick to generate a sense of empathy from the viewer. There is also a very, very strong Chinese Military Patriotism element in this movie, making it also feel like a Chinese Michael Bay film, but I don't count this against the movie because it makes sense (being a film made in China) and because it's actually purely a positive message - It uses heroism to bestow Patriotic Propaganda but doesn't use it to justify any morally grey misdeeds on the part of the heroes (I mean, it's literally about soldiers protecting unarmed civilians under fire). If you want a fun time you will find it in this movie, which is explosive, full of stunts, and works well on a technical level as well.",Wolf Warrior 2,Wolf Warrior II - Movie Reviews

Beaucoup plus sympathique en mercenaire au grand coeur qu'en soldat de l'armée chinoise, Wu Jing est aussi accompagné de Celina Jade et surtout de Frank Grillo, qui se délecte à jouer les salopards. Tout ceci serait une bonne nouvelle si Wolf Warrior II n'était pas un film aussi abject au niveau idéologique, considérant que l'Afrique est un continent inférieur, une zone de non-droit avec une population gentille mais ne servant que de chair à canon pour les bienfaits de l'action (on ne compte pas moins de 6 massacres filmés avec délectation).

2692,4d ago,"You can tell they put a good deal of thought into making this one maybe if for no other reason than to give the viewer connections to the original trilogy story. I have to nick the film for a few reasons. It tries so hard in the first half to try and be a drama with Anakin unsure of what he should do. The movie then segways into him completely changing course mentally almost immediately with one scene in particular seeming unbelievable by any stretch - he was conflicted before this scene but he does a complete 180 in seconds and it just seems haphazardly written here. The movie also does a disservice to our prequel heroine, Padme. She is reduced to a stand by your man 'til it kills you 50s style house wife; it's sad because she was a cool woman who could fend for herself in the first two films. She's turned into a prop here and it's only her acting that saves it from being a wash. Last ding is that it's hard to believe the Jedi didn't know the Sith Lord was right in front of them the whole time; they're supposed to be wise and have prophetic abilities. All that to say this: there are some great battle sequences including the best lightsaber battle in the series. The back and forth storytelling works well here to keep the viewer engaged. I can't say the film is easy to watch in the middle - Anakin's transition into Vader is not only convoluted but disturbing. It's especially hard to watch in juxtaposition to the rest of the series' tone. We can assume things about good and evil but to see Vader's fall from grace is very depressing. It is easily the least enjoyable 40ish minutes to watch in the whole saga. The first 40 and last 40 minutes however are enough to make it not only good but the best in the prequels. As a standalone story it is well done but not a movie you'll want to rewatch for fun - it's essential to the overarching story and that's it.",SHOW MORE,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith - Movie Reviews
2693,Aidan B,"Nov 20, 2021","Though the film can get a bit uneven at parts, the conclusion is ultimately satisfying and heartbreaking to watch as it wraps up this mediocre trilogy with spectacular fashion. ""Revenge of the Sith"" has the best story, CGI, and action of any of the prequel films made, and the film perfectly sets the stage for ""A New Hope."" I think that George Lucas had a perfect plan with this trilogy, though ended up failing in the process to get to this film. This third installment in the prequel trilogy is absolutely gorgeous to watch, and due to its very memorable and emotional moments throughout, ""Revenge of the Sith"" remains as one of the best ""Star Wars"" movie to date, despite its several flaws.",Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith - Movie Reviews

It explains Anakin's tragedy very well and the morality of the Jedi Order too. Great movie, i would suggest to Star Wars The Clone Wars Season 7 after the movie.

Also the plot itself is very epic and central for Star Wars itself. The focus in on emotions, imo the genre Space Opera gets a positive view by this movie, because it's theatralic and emotional. Dialogues and scenes might be too much ""set in scene"" for some people because they're classical theatre-like.

2729,Yuri L,"Sep 18, 2021","A very underrated movie. This film accomplished what the prequel trilogy was aiming to do, which was to elaborate on the backstory of Darth Vader and Palpatine's rise to power through the corruption of the republic. We are shown how Palpatine's manipulation of Anakin comes to fruition after years of careful planning. We see the failure of the Anakin Obi Wan relationship and the establishment of Luke and Leia's upbringings. This film also has an amazing score, including some of John William's finest works such as Battle of the Heros and Duel of the Fates. This film also makes excellent parallels with the rise of Hitler and the fall of democracy in post WW1 Germany. I do have some issues with this film, namely some of the acting is a little over the top. I also think the handling of Padme's death was rather cheesy. I think it would have been more fitting if it was eluded that Palpatine killed her instead of heartbreak.

This was my favorite movie growing up and I still have so much nostalgia for it. Anyone born in the 90s that is a star wars fan probably agrees that this was such a fun time to watch as a child. I remember my first time watching it and how amazing it was to see obiwan become ben and Anakin become Darth Vader. This inspired me to love movies the way I do today. Looking back at the movie now I definitely will note the cheesy dialogue here and there but it is still such a solid movie. I LOVE the lightsaber battles in this movie. I thought Ewan McGregor as obiwan was a perfect cast and Ian McDermott as Darth sidious is terrifying. Everyone should agree that this is by far the best of the prequel trilogy.

2737,ANDERSON G,"Sep 06, 2021","""Various Games: In Flames"" is a competent sequel but much less charismatic than its predecessor, shifting the focus to something more political, the transaction is good, the script is less linear but with continuity problems. The continuation of the franchise had more than 50 million in budget than its predecessor, although we don't feel this visually expressive improvement, the cache can have food a lot of the money, as we have a less authorial film that perpetuates what worked in the first one though it lacks a greater depth of the characters. ""Ravenous Games: On Fire"" hasn't aged as well as the first one, we feel a repetition of ideas, we have a climax that should have been built before, but the characters are still great and the performances at a good level such as costumes, makeup and soundtrack, in addition to photography, which improves significantly.

It is everything a sequel should be. This film has such an incredible fast pace and energy to it that makes it so enjoyable to watch. We also meet new characters in this film like Finnick and Johanna, who are also my two favorite characters in the series. My only main complaint is that I do think it feels a little bit too similar to the first film since we do have to go through all the training and interviews and prepping all over again since Katniss has to go back into the games.

These wonderful elements now are more blatant and over the top. Saying this though, this is the Marvel sequel we were all waiting for, incorporating unknown characters without brow-beating us about upcoming films in the MCU, potential spin-offs and sequels and just creating more depth in the Guardians universe.

2796,Nathan D,"Aug 06, 2021","This film is definitely a step-up from the first installment as the story is just so much better. James Gunn really poured a lot into this movie which led to such an amazing film. The overall message of the movie is so beautiful and offers so many iconic moments. The film always has something going on and a lot of the story details never get lost in other plots. Some aspects of the film are a tiny bit complicated, but it doesn't hurt the movie all that much. A large reason why this movie feels a lot more whole is that the characters are way better developed here. Peter's story excels greatly into something really beautiful. I would even say the same about Yondu as in the first film, Yondu didn't feel all that important. This film, however, made me greatly appreciate Yondu and his actions in the first film. Rocket, Gamora, and Nebula also get some more character development that I think benefited them greatly. Even new characters like Ego and Mantis were very easy to attach some type of connection to as they are both very well developed. The only character I would say is poorly written is Drax, which sucks because I really liked Drax in the first film. Drax came off as rude and annoying for a large part of the film and his jokes weren't all that funny this time around. As much as I loved the characters in this film from a story standpoint, the actors weren't all that great. Both Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana do a poor job in their roles. Their line delivery is off some of the time and I never felt the energy their performances had in the first film. Plus, both actors never convinced me that they had a love connection forming. Another actor that struggled was Dave Bautista. He was sometimes trying too hard to sell his joke or line that it came off in a cringeworthy way. However, the rest of the cast was pretty solid. Bradley Cooper did a fantastic job just like in the first film and new additions to the franchise Kurt Rusell and Pom Klementieff do an awesome job with both really nailing down the personalities of their characters. Michael Rooker is the stand-out to me in this film. Rooker had some great line delivery and really made the message of the film feel powerful and impactful. The production design of this film was flawless. Everything looked so stunning and the design of Ego's planet was just so well done. The color choices were great and how the technology on the planet moved was just so cool to watch. However, the cinematography felt a little weaker in this film. It was still very good, but I don't think cinematographer Henry Braham really made any shots look visually breathtaking like Ben Davis did in the first film. Something that did improve was the score. It was better than in the first one with Tyler Bates creating some memorable tracks and more of a balance between songs and the score. Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was definitely a step-up storywise, but somewhat of a step-down when looking at some of the cast. Even though I do like this film better than the first one, I do think the cast was a lot better in the first installment rather than the second. However, the strong, heartfelt story really hides all the casts' flaws and really sets this film over the top.

2797,Jonathan K,"Jul 29, 2021","The first Guardians of the Galaxy was a lot of insanity and a fair amount of heart -- this Sequel has a fair amount of insanity and a lot of heart. And I really mean it - much of the movie does ask that you feel ""this is funny"" or ""this is cool"", but there are numerous parts where the movie make you feel Mortified, Triumphant or even legitimately Sad. The final few minutes of the movie before the credits roll are absolutely spellbinding, and I literally tear-up every time I watch the final act of this movie. The final act is both Inspiring and then Heartbreaking shortly afterwards, and the fact that a Marvel movie has, upon multiple viewings, brought me to tears really shows how outstanding this film is. Like many, I would've liked a bit more insanity, but this is EASILY the Second Most Insane movie of the MCU (part 1 being the #1 spot), and since the trade-off was genuine emotional impact, I am more than happy with the exchange we got. If you love movies that cover a wide spectrum of emotions and does so effectively, then Guardians of the Galaxy 2 might be the best movie to do so in a very long time. You will laugh, you will cheer, your heartrate will occasionally rise and you will end it having had your soul crushed. In terms of pure entertainment and emotional impact and satisfaction, I'd argue this might be the best Space Opera since The Empire Strikes Back - yes, I really mean that.",Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 - Movie Reviews

2800,Cailan D,"Jul 23, 2021","GotG Vol. 2 isn't quite as good as its predecessor, but even though it does fall into the ""sequel is worse"" category, it still remains a solid and entertaining MCU blockbuster and comes close enough to the original to be enjoyable. The script doesn't have the finesse of the first movie causing the humor to drag and be a little over the top at points, but the actors do a fine job of getting around this causing a few of these moments to be genuinely funny. It's nice that this movie takes us deeper into the character of Peter Quill by exploring his family, a route that was set up well at the end of Guardians 1. What's even better about this is watching how Peter learning about and discovering his true family impacts his relationship with his ""new"" family: his fellow Guardians. This impact adds some emotional depth to the film, and makes Peter Quill a surprisingly complex character and takes him through a really nice arc that forces him to truly consider his relationships with those he cares about the most. Pratt supplements this with another great performance as the character, and his fellow Guardians castmates hit the spot as well. The movie makes sure to make good use of Kurt Russell as Ego by giving him plenty of screen time, a backstory, and a few emotional moments of his own. It also kicked ass to see the true power and capabilities of Yondu's flying arrow, something we got a taste of in the first movie but was amplified substantially in this movie. It's also still a relief and breath of fresh air that this film has no connection to the Avengers and the rest of the cinematic universe other than us knowing that it's a part of it. As mentioned before, what really prevents this movie from reaching the heights of GotG 1 for me is the humor, since even with the acting the script hampers this movie's ability to be as funny as GotG 1. GotG 2 is nonetheless still a fun and entertaining movie and is sure to leave viewers satisfied as the credits roll.",Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 - Movie Reviews

2820,Puroo R,"Aug 20, 2021","Pixar has made movies of all kinds - What if toys had feelings, what if insects had feelings, what if monsters had feelings, what if cars had feelings, what if fishes had feelings, what if rats had feelings. And now they have made Inside Out - what if feelings had feelings? Inside Out is probably one of the most underrated movies that Pixar has made. It was the first original Pixar movie which I didn't get to know about when it released (the first such one was a sequel, Monsters University), and I'm really surprised how this movie gets overlooked so easily. The way I see it, this movie is a social commentary about how we perceive life with our emotions. Riley here is a metaphor of us, how we feel when we move to a new place and are unable to handle the new life. In such situations we either feel scared, angry or depressed. When Riley starts crying in class, Joy tries to stop Sadness from ruining her memory with a vacuum but ends up destroying all her other memories. This is another metaphor from our lives, where we end up forgetting all our happy memories in times of desperation. Later on Joy and Sadness are in her memories, where they see Riley's childhood drawing of Bing Bong whom she considered her friend. The plot has been made with a complete sense of nostalgia. When we feel nostalgic, we feel both happiness and sadness at the same time. We are happy because we got to live those times, the time which was better than what we are living at the moment. We are sad because we know that time never stops, and so everyday we are straying further away from when it happened. We will never be able to live the day again, and it shall only stay in our memory. While Joy and Sadness are not present Fear, Anger and Disgust control her. I don't think I need to explain this. Riley has lost all her happiness and does not feel any sadness. Keep in mind she had previously cried in class, which is something very embarrassing for a ten year old child. As a result she does not want to show her sorrow in front of everyone since she fears people will laugh at her, so instead she tries to cover it with anger and disgust. This is just like how we behave when we are depressed but are also too afraid of what others might think if they learn about it. And then there is the memory dump, the place where the old memories are forgotten. This is one of the deepest messages that the movie gave us. To save Joy and Sadness and allow them to get out of the pit, Bing Bong readily sacrifices himself. This is because he had always considered himself and Riley friends, and he was ready to sacrifice his own life for this. It also shows how Riley has now lost the memory of Bing Bong due to her depression and frustration, and it is something she will never remember again. This is a metaphor of how we forget the small details from our childhood which gave us joy once we grow out of the phase. It also symbolises that although Bing Bong has been lost forever, Riley's joy and sadness will always remember him. This is similar to how we get nostalgic whenever we see our childhood writings and drawings. And finally when Joy and Sadness do make it back, then Joy chooses to let Sadness guide Riley. If she wanted she could have guided Riley and make her feel happy about reuniting with her parents. But in that case the moment would have completely lost the impact. So instead Sadness did it, which is why Riley started crying, something she had not done for a long time. This is yet another metaphor of when we are unable to hold our sorrow for too long and burst out crying. As a result her parents are finally able to understand the situation she is in and give her more love. In the end Riley starts feeling happy, since everyone has understood the value of Joy. She was the first emotion that Riley felt, and the one who guided them all in the time of desperation. All the other emotions came to her afterwards, which is why they are not as emotionally attached to Riley as Joy does. Joy knows what is the best for her, just like how we feel the best thing for our life is what makes us happy.",Inside Out,Inside Out - Movie Reviews

2825,Jacob R,"Jul 02, 2021","Just….how? How did Pixar make another flawless film after three films that I would either consider meh or bad? I just don't get it! Let's just make sure Pete Doctor directs every Pixar movie ever and we will be a-ok. I don't want to talk about all the good things with this movie, because let's face it: everyone has done that. Instead, I want to talk about all the things that this Pixar movie does better than all the others. First, I think this is the best voice cast for any Pixar movies prior or after this. The only one that kind of comes close for me is Toy Story 4, but that's for a different review. Biggest highlight is of course the great work of Amy Phoeler as Joy, it was just spot on. Next, comedy. Seeing how the main character is literally the concept of Joy, I would like to think that this movie was going to be funny. And I was right with this being, in my personal opinion, the funniest Pixar movie. Lewis Black as Anger is just a laughing riot to me. He was hilarious! Finally, how can you not talk about this movie without mentioning the ending, with two big emotional parts that really leave a huge impact. The first being the death of Bing Bong, which feels a little like it comes out of nowhere, but you're going to remember it. And, of course, when Riley comes home from running away and the parents also say that they miss the old home….OMG it's so good! The only kind of problem is that Anger is mainly the reason all the islands get destroyed, and no one addresses it at any moment. But that's minor, and no one is going to be thinking that in their first viewing, I only noticed it in my most previous viewing of the movie anyway. I really think someone should do a deeper dive into this movie, cause it really deserves it. However, I can only praise it for so long.

2834,Ethan T,"May 11, 2021","From a few of the same key players that brought Up, Inside Out is another profoundly affective animated drama guaranteed to pry emotion from anyone with a heart. The voice cast and animation all seem to be up to Pixar standard, while the emotion alone makes the film. The story combines the gut-wrenching and the fun, but does require the switching off of brains. Every story needs some logic or rules, even within a fantasy, to really work and have genuine stakes, and this just doesn't. You're introduced to the system, but you receive the feeling that elements and abilities In the moment, the film does more than enough to be positively memorable and pack a top-tier emotional punch, and this alone makes it good despite its numerous problems.",Inside Out,Inside Out - Movie Reviews

2844,Karol C,"Mar 22, 2021","Inside Out review A heartfelt animated movie, ""Inside Out"", takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions with creative imagination and a look back at some nostalgic moments we might have had in our childhood. Unlike any other, Pixar studios created an original movie of the emotions that go behind a person's mind and made them into having their own personalities. Focused on the mind of a little girl ,Riley her life is shown as typically any perfect childhood. With the presence of the emotion joy it shows her story of her two loving parents raising her and living the life with many moments that one child creates. Including the building of humor, friendship and playing your favorite sport. But as all children go through the other emotions such as sadness, fear ,disgust and anger it will include her experiences. However, her life takes a sudden turn when she has to move with her parents from their hometown Minnesota to San Francisco. Her emotions will be put to the test in adapting to a new lifestyle they're typically unused to. To start off , it shows the beginning of the first years in Riley's life. Transitioning from stages to the preteens years of her life. This is where she experiences many emotions and personal likeness and dislikeness. Riley is seen on her journey as she experiences all typical childhood memories. From learning how to walk to talking your first new words. Discovering your least favorite meal to favorite toy to take with you everywhere. The laughter you create and the sad moments you experience. The rewarding moments of receiving a good grade to being upset for losing an important game. As Riley is growing she has experienced majority exciting emotions until a certain news comes to her attention. She will be moving from her childhood home Minnesota, where she was born, raised, and grew up to miles away into the city of San Francisco. Despite the change , her emotion Joy makes Riley see all this in a positive way. Meeting new friends, decorating a new room and many more ideas. Arriving at the new location, Riley is quick to notice the drastic change in seeing her new home. Adapting to the city and less outdoor activity is one of the unfortunate changes making her find new adventures. On her first day of school, she is introduced to her classmates and told to talk a bit more from her time back home. As she recalls some of her favorite memories, the emotion sadness touches her favorite memory, changing Riley's memory to a sad moment and turning it into a sorrowful memory. Joy continues to try and make Riley enjoy the new memories. After they had another similar disagreement Joy and Sadness cause the core memories to be knocked from their containers and accidentally vacuumed along with them into Riley's emotional interior. With this problem, it leaves the other emotions Fear, Disgust and Anger to run the emotions until the others return changing RIleys behavior. Throughout the film it shows the many obstacles and challenges Joy and Sadness must go through to reach the headquarters. Following with revisiting old memories and lifelong imaginary friends. It will take a spin through some future glimpse some being Riley's future boyfriend and many more. Overall this unfortunate event turned out to be a better lesson. The emotions appreciating each other's teamwork to help Riley have the best life she could as she grows up. Enjoying the moments one creates as living life with a positive attitude.",Inside Out,Inside Out - Movie Reviews

2851,Nattapong S,"Mar 10, 2021","Normally, Almost every animation which are made by Disney and Pixar are interesting to most people because they mostly fun, happy to watch, beautiful graphic, etc. , but I think 'Inside out' is more than that. I have remembered that in the time this movie has been released, it was very famous. But I have not seen it yet until two months ago that I watched it. The first time I have seen this movie to the end. I understood to many media why they rated this animated movie very high. First It is about the graphic of the animation. As we have known. Disney and Pixar are one of the best animation studios about graphic, and they have done to this movie very well, such as an appearance of a character. There are lots of details about graphic, sharpness of the video, etc. Second, sound effect. In my opinion. Sound effect are very important to every movie in the scenes that want to show, or express more the feeling to the audiences than only the movie scene. And this movie expresses the feeling to the audiences very well such as happy, sad, scared. The last thing and it is the most interesting point is about feeling. It is what this movie expresses to us. For me, this part is the point that makes this movie different to other animation movies that Disney and Pixar have made. It is more than a movie for entertaining. It teaches us how we can control our feeling , however I will not tell you what feeling that I mean. I want you find it by yourself in the movie. Then after you watch it, you will understand what I have told to you. But there is one inferior point in this movie. It is distribution of the character. Some characters are very notable, but there are few characters have a few of air time, scenes that they act. In my opinion, 'Inside out' is still one of my best animation movie. For me, I give it 1/3 of the best Disney and Pixar movie of all time. If anyone is looking for some full of quality movie. 'Inside out' is the great choice. concluding, very well work for Disney and Pixar making this movie. I give 9 out of 10. I hope you enjoy my review more or less.

My only critique is the film was originally shot to be about two-and-a-half hours and was shortened by the studio and included reshoots. Originally Tessa Thompson's character 142 was to have more backstory, Hela's arrival was completely altered by CGI from what was seen in the trailer BUT what did work in reshoots was the addition of a funny ‘theatrical' performance including an Oscar winning actor.",Thor: Ragnarok,Thor: Ragnarok - Movie Reviews

We can't have economic freedom without bodily autonomy and basic civil liberties as well as a government that enforces those liberties. Kidnapping Fischer was a vicious, cowardly and morally bankrupt and not the work of a hero. I disliked the character so much I didn't care what happened to them so the movie was boring as well. The fact this ham fisted, pedantic and desultory film is supposed to be ""intelligent"" is particularly disturbing. Imagine a future where computer nerds rule the world by forcibly kidnapping us and then implanting ""good"" ideas into our brains and those of our children to make sure we do the ""right"" thing.

Then I watched it again and appreciated the extremely impressive elements of it much more. The directing talent from Christopher Nolan is truly remarkable and the special effects/CGI is great. The action scenes especially in the middle of the film were my favorite parts, plus the ending scene. Not to mention the cast of actors that they were able to have participate in the production, very noteworthy. The film does have some issues though that may alienate some viewers. Much of the phenomenon in the movie is left up to a lot of interpretation and can make your mind too blown while you're still trying to keep up with the plot. It can be a lot to take in all at once and confuse people who aren't used to a movie like this. Plus I think that the romance between Cobb and Mal bogged down the main mission of the team a little too much, but I still see why something like that was included. Overall a pretty good movie! There is a lot to say about this movie and many ways to analyze it and that's why it was popular I guess!",Inception,Inception - Movie Reviews

2960,Stefano D,"Aug 27, 2021","A perfectly paced, written and directed story that will send your mind to an endless pondering and mesmerising journey. Nolan really knows what he's doing when it comes fiction. He knows how to deliberately lose the audience's comprehension to then retrieve it with magnificence. What truly makes Nolan's famous fiction movie Inception a masterpiece of time and reality mayhem, is the way the story is written and developed. It starts with a pretty strenuous concept: the inception of dreams. But then, as the story unwraps, with well-pace actions, embracing dialogues and great characters dissections, we begin to fathom what this concept of infiltrating dreams can serve for, alongside how it actually works – using great insight of true physics and thorough studies upon the very subject of dreams and time. All leading to an ending that wraps into this ""open ways"" notion. The casting is straight up perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio embraced the role of Dom Cobb as a professional, really diving into the trauma of the protagonist and exploiting the pain and adventurous errands that this character went through in his past. Tom Hardy nailed the role of the Eames, a character capable of impersonating others within one's dream, using his seriousness and his passionate sheer acting. Cillian Murphy, managed to play the role of a broken son left with the legacy of his dead father like a boss, using his prowess acting and his bewitching voice. And last, but not least, Eliott Page, who really knows how to do her job and create an emotional and interesting character, Ariadne, ready to help her team as the ingenious architect of dreams. I could spend a day writing about the story and how the cast, the full cast, is perfectly chosen, but I think the points I've given are enough to catch your attention – without spoiling the whole narrative – if you haven't seen the movie yet.",Inception,Inception - Movie Reviews

2973,Jonathan K,"Oct 25, 2021","There are few objectively bad cinematic experiences that I like as much as the Michael Bay Transformers movies, but Part 2: Revenge of the Fallen, is the one I will never rush to defend. It's aggressive, it's loud, it's obnoxious, it's WAY too long, and I never thought I'd say this about a Michael Bay movie, but: It feels Lazy. This last one is the biggest oddity in regards to this movie, as Michael Bay's biggest problem has always been that it feels like he Directs and Edits after drinking a double-dosage of RedBalls Energy Drink (for those that watched Chapelle Show), but half of this movie looks like Bay just Directed it after taking Melatonin, as the cinematography is surprisingly plain, the stunts less intense than his usual work, the action blocking is a lot less intricate than with any other movie of his, and there's so much in this movie that simply did not need to exist that it felt like Bay was shooting most of this out of obligation. Let's throw in the fact that this movie is simultaneously the Most Comedic yet Least Funny entry of his Transformers movies, and you also have a movie that suffers greatly from inconsistent tone (a problem the others suffered from as well but not nearly to the degree here). The one distinctly good moment in this movie is a desperate fight in the forest between Optimus Prime and several Decipticons, as it's one that plays out with genuine stakes, has weighty consequences, ends on a powerful note and feature's excellent cinematography, choreography and sound design. It's a shame as this bit is genuinely great, the sole legitimately shining moment in a movie that balances between low-tier mediocrity and the outright awful.",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen - Movie Reviews

2976,Puroo R,"Aug 18, 2021","When I had heard everyone say that Transformers movies keep getting worse as time moves on I was actually very hesitant to watch this. I really liked the first movie so there was no way I could believe that THIS franchise could possibly be bad (although I did see that later on, I didn't see it here). In my review of the first movie I said how I got interested in the Transformers franchise after watching it, since I didn't know this was actually a toys company and not an anime series. If that movie was just the introduction, this was where the real action takes place. I saw Revenge of the Fallen on Amazon Prime soon after the first one. I only had one week left before my Prime subscription would expire, so I had only decided to dedicate this time to watching all the Transformers movies so that I could understand what this franchise is all about. Unlike the future movie this one actually expanded on what was established at the first movie. Although the human characters were not as interesting as the previous movie and the story was also pretty much empty, the action scenes completely made up for it. As usual the CGI and action was very good. The new characters introduced were fun to watch. I really like to see it when new characters are brought in and given their own character development as they transform into cool cars. However not everything about this movie was good. Like I said above the human characters were not as interesting. The entire blood about Sam going to college and his parents continuously pestering him was very annoying. This was the last time we got to see Mikaela, which is also something very sad IYKWIM. This movie was able to explain very well the entire concept of Transformers, something that the prequel fail to do so. Before I used to think that Autobots and Decepticons are supposed to be cars, but now I know that they are actually robots which can turn themselves into whatever they see in front of them. I would definitely give a rewatch afterwards sometime in the future whenever I have to show this franchise to a new generation.",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen - Movie Reviews

The movie isn't finished yet, and you can tell; there are some funny awkward jokes strewn around, and there are a few minor narrative holes here and there, but I can see where they're heading, and I LOVE it. The plot is very interesting to explore, including the history of Transformers and the lasting effects of that legacy that transcends time. Also you will not find better action in any other film than in this one; the action is nonstop and visually appealing and it will keep you at the edge of your seat.

While I do think the opening and closing moments of the movie are solid, I think this movie seriously drags in the middle. For a movie that is supposed to be the big finally, this movie is super underwhelming. As usual, the acting and dialogue aren't great, but this movie mercifully doesn't focus much on the unconvincing romance in this series. I just feel the way it ends is kind of a cop-out, happily ever after type of ending, and it makes the whole series feel a bit pointless. I can't speak on behalf of the book but I think this franchise saw an opportunity to make some money and dragged this story into two full-length movies when in reality just one big two and a half hour movie might have been handled more neatly and effectively.

In Part 2, Bella and Edward's love-child brings a conflict between the Cullen family, the pack of werewolves lead by Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) and the Volturi cult led by Aro (Michael Sheen). Having not seen the other films or read the Stephanie Meyer books, I could never follow why being immortal would be a threat to the Volturi vampires or how the vampires inexplicably gain powers like chopping logs like a cheese cracker, superspeed, or super-jump. It also didn't help that the visual effects are far below the standards of a Sci-Fi channel movie, demonstrated by the werewolves, motion blurs, the backdrops, and the baby. Another list of stupidity: Bella learning to act human, the elemental powers that contribute nothing to vampirism, the ethnic stereotypes, and the climactic battle near the end which was all a vision. The only redeeming and entertaining value in the whole series so far is Michael Sheen, who bites the scenery gloriously and even has that silly hammy laugh as an act of threat. While nicely shot and not with some crazy and funny moments, Breaking Dawn Part 2 is still a poorly written, poorly acted and poorly directed mess.

3043,Jacob B,"Aug 21, 2019","The best Twilight film...mostly owing to the fact that it's the last one of these suckers (no pun intended). There's a final battle that's actually quite badass, despite being remarkably gore-free for an all-out massacre...which then leads to probably the cheapest movie cop-out I've ever seen in a movie, though I won't spoil it for you. Michael Sheen has more screen time after being limited to just two scenes in the terrible New Moon movie and only allowed to have a Marvel-style mid-credits scene cameo in the last movie. And, the movie for once isn't boring with some nice cinematography and a decent opening credits sequence. It's still not good despite being the best film but I'd rather take an average fantasy action film than a dull romance anytime. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson's performances aren't any different from what we're used to seeing from them at this point, the ending is probably not as happy as Stephenie Meyer and Bill Condon seem to think it is and it's clear the special effects budget was dedicated to just the final battle because Bella and Edward running looks abysmally fake and the CGI baby is much more creepy here than in Part 1. Did I mention the cheap cop-out? I think I did. Glad to get this franchise over with though I might see the adaptation of The Host, seeing how the book is written by the same author. It is fascinating to see how a series that was always generally considered to be not good still managed to have movies that were all hugely successful at the box office. While there have been good first films followed by a series of crappy sequels such as Transformers and the Resident Evil movie series, Twilight was considered to be a bad film franchise from many detractors since day one yet the sequels still managed to show up amongst the 10 highest-grossing films of the year from 2009 to 2012. We might never get a definitive answer as to just how popular this series ended up being but for the time being, let's all take a moment and feel either relieved or sad that this series has come to an end.",The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 - Movie Reviews

The director Roland Emmerich had once again proves he is the master of making big budget disaster movie flops like 2012 (2009). The absence of Will Smith due to his appearance in the even worse film Suicide Squad (2016) really ruins it for me.

I don't know where the studio brass' collective heads were when they green-lit this movie but my best guess is that they took a jump to the left out of a time warp. Never the less, everyone's favorite Sunday afternoon movie is back with a new chapter starring Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman reprising their roles as David and President Whitmore along side Liam Hemsworth, Jessie T. Usher who plays the son of the absent Will Smith's character and Maika Monroe as Whitmore's daughter. Also returning are Brent Spiner and the incomparable Judd Hirsche as David's father Julius. In short everyone is here to take on another swing at the alien menace who, in response to their crushing defeat in 1996, have sent in a call to their home planet for reinforcements. The biggest stumbling block this movie has is just how impossibly late it is. The original film, despite it's flaws, had a lot going for it with it's white hot cast, adventurous spirit and unique story. It didn't matter that a computer running Windows 95 could somehow interface with an alien spaceship or that Vivica A. Fox and Boomer the dog avoid a trillion degree fire by hiding from it in a closet or just how impossibly racist Judd Hirsche's character was. It just felt right at the time. This movie however is just so long overdue that it's no longer the cute as a button baby that we would have embraced with open arms had it come out in 1998. Instead, it's an overweight 34 year old man with a mustard stain on his horribly faded Blues Traveler t-shirt. The overall story feels dated, juvenile and ridiculously out of place especially when compared to the films that came in it's wake over the last 20 years like Edge of Tomorrow and Battle Los Angeles which believe it or not is a better film than this. The action is confusing, the story is limp and certain characters make returns only to die or unceremoniously be written out of the story for no real reason at all. There is an extremely interesting side plot dealing with an ground war that the aliens fought with human forces in Africa which would have made an incredible film in and of itself but that bit is forsaken in favor of more cameos and another far more convoluted story line that ends with an even more unbelievable and convoluted cliffhanger. Ultimately I can't really recommend this movie to anyone other than the biggest of big ID4 fans.

The look into a magical government was also nice. The ""Fantastic Beasts"" part of the film was great. The other part, dealing with society and politics, was quite disappointing.

3150,Puroo R,"Jun 15, 2021","I have just finished watching the movie on Prime Video and everything is absolutely fresh in my mind right now. I had no idea what I was going in for. I didn't read the original book or watch any trailer before seeing this movie. All I had heard was that this takes place in the same universe as Harry Potter, which is why I watched it. And honestly speaking, this movie is nothing different from what I expected it would be. The problem with this movie is that it's very, very cliched. It uses those exact plot points that make an annoying movie, well, annoying. That's literally how this movie begins: Making an annoying creature do things for which the protagonist gets in trouble. This is just like how Dobby was in The Chamber of Secrets, except over there he was doing it because he had been asked to do so. The marsupial mole over here wasn't doing it for any particular reason at all, except for being cringy. If I were Newt I'd have just let him get caught and die. And then of course, Newt is unregistered. The way the movie began made it seem like Newt was a complete idiot, except that the whole point behind his character is that he's smart. He's the only one person who cares about the beasts of the magical world unlike the zoophobic wizards. Every species in this whole movie - muggles, wizards, magical creatures - everyone was unlikeable. They all did things which made me want them to get their comeuppance. The only thing that saved this movie for me was the world building. I have heard that the book is actually a guidebook for all the creatures living in their universe. So this, being an adaptation, was the only good part in the entire movie. And it was so beautiful that I enjoyed this otherwise irritating movie. I really wish that was the main focus of the movie instead of them being about fugitives running from the law and something something Ezra Miller. Another thing I really liked about this movie is the depiction of the 1920's America. All the characters looked like they belonged in that age. The ignorant, hateful behaviour of the people from that time was very well depicted, if that was intentional. The acting was great. People reacted just like how they would if the CGI was present before them in real life. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a movie that seems to be more oriented for a young audience, since they are the ones who will find it more appealing. It has cool and cute animals, funny scenes, childish storyline and overall the 90's and early 00's vibe to it. It's a one time watch for the adults, since the only good thing to offer for a mature audience is the phenomenal CGI. It won't remain as interesting if watched for a second time, which is why I'd recommend you to not ruin the experience by watching it for the second time.",Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them - Movie Reviews

I firmly expected them to not completely recapture the magnetism of the main series as there was practically no chance with an entirely new cast, and I wasn't itching for a continuation of the franchise I'd loved as I'd just seen the old ones. Redmayne made for an enigmatic leading man, though I wasn't enamored with Waterston and I never truly understood the appeal of Farrell. The CGI is very good, particularly the non-creature stuff but the beasts are good too when not sitting right next to a real animal, like the Niffler near the beginning. The clear intent with this one was to worldbuild, which I found mildly unnecessary (and a bit obnoxious with them exchanging Muggle with No-Maj for No-Apparent reason), but I liked the plot itself for the most part too. They seemed to stay a bit too long in the suitcase each time they went as it started to feel like an entire universe was inside and that they may set one of the movies exclusively in there, but that would be so far removed from reality that I doubt it'd be very entertaining.

3160,Meydiana R,"Mar 15, 2021","No story & too much CGI I have to say that I am really disappointed of the movie as a whole. The Harry Potter movies are easily one of the best and most rewatchable movie franchises so far. And this movie is sadly nothing like the original HP movies. The only thing that is has in common are the special effects (for the apparitions). There was no real dialogue between the characters. Just silly one-liners and the occasional humorous remark. I am also very angered by the fact that they just introduced a new concept (obscurials) to the HP franchise that would literally change everything (if obscurials exist why hasn't Harry Potter become one? After all he fits the criteria). There was also way too much CGI in the movie. It became a real nuisance after a while. Especially because it wasn't even ""up to today's standards"". My final critique concerns the overall flair of the movie. It just didn't feel like it belongs to the magnum opus that is the HP movie franchise. And righteously so; why did they film it in NYC? The HP franchise is the most British thing since James Bond and Doctor Who. I never really realized it before but now that I watched this movie it became very clear to me. You can't just change the location like this and expect the audience to embrace it. Sorry. What's next? Fantastic Beasts in Japan? No thanks.

Esta trata sobre el Príncipe encantador que quiere venganza por lo ocurrido anteriormente, lo cual me gustaba al inicio como una motivación para el villano pero solo lo convirtieron en un tonto en vez de un villano serio e intimidante. Los personajes que nos presentan son mas de lo mismo, que no buscan trabajarlos en su tonalidad y que buscan rellenar la trama con algunos chistes malos e innecesarios; aunque hay chistes muy buenos en la película. Se le puede destacar la animación y lo entretenida que puede ser. La música esta vez no es tan buena como las de las anteriores películas y hasta sentí un intento de copiar la misma formula que antes pero mal hecha. Los nuevos personajes no me gustaron para nada y tuvieron escenas innecesarias. Sacaron el protagonismo de las otras películas que tenía Fiona y eso no me gustó nada. Por ultimo, el final con el discurso de Arturo deja mucho que desear y parece sacado de la nada para darle un final abrupto al conflicto.

3188,Puroo R,"Jul 11, 2021","Shrek the Third was the first Shrek movie I learnt of. I always used to see the Shrek franchise as something of a fairy tale, one that I can't possibly like. There were many reasons why - Shrek looked ugly, the animation wasn't exactly what I'd call 'gorgeous', and the little me couldn't tolerate seeing a princess beat up soldiers (I know, it happens in Shrek 2 and Shrek the Third but I couldn't tell the difference). So I finally watched it, just to see what all happens in it and why exactly does everyone meme it so much. I liked the first two so much that I decided to watch this movie too, and it was... meh. Shrek the Third started off really well. But the problem with this movie is that, well, it created an expectation too high. The first five minutes were actually very good, with Prince Charming grieving over his mother's death and everyone mocking him. But immediately afterwards it changed to the bad guys deciding to hate him for being bad. This didn't make sense, because that's literally what bad guys do. And then the bad guys unite to wreak havoc and... Remove a stamp? It looked like a joke that could have been in any other movie. Speaking of jokes that could have been in literally any other movie, there are plenty that happen over here. The king dying and then coming back to life before dying properly, Shrek throwing a champagne bottle at a ship making it sink, Puss explaining how babies are made, Shrek and Donkey threatening the librarian (I still remember seeing that scene in the trailer as a kid), Puss and Donkey not being restored to their original bodies completely in the end and of course, the entire plot of Arthur being a loser. But of course this movie isn't absolutely terrible. I really liked the speeches that Arthur gave; once at the campfire when he and Shrek talked about their lives and once in the end where they defeat Prince Charming. The part where Puss tries to look cute when he's in Donkey's body and the soldiers get disgusted was also hilarious. I also enjoyed the part where all the princesses come together to storm the castle. I hated that scene as a kid but now I find it funny. Shrek the Third is the only 3rd movie of a franchise that I have ever realised wasn't as good as the previous ones. I watched Spider-Man 3, Star Wars: Episode VI, Despicable Me 3 and even played Batman: Arkham Origins, and I really liked them all as much as I liked the other two. It doesn't have quite the charm that the first two movies, for that matter all the other three movies have. It's a pity that I really wanted to like this movie, but it seems too mediocre.

3201,Italian G,"Mar 13, 2021","This review contains spoilers. According to many Shrek the Third represents the lowest point of the franchise. And they are right. I'm not saying this is a bad movie. It is simply meh. The continuation of the story is perhaps a bit too banal, but in full swing with a familiar continuation. The animations are very good, but nothing comparable to the latest films. The known characters undergo practically no evolution, both Shrek and the others, but donkey always remains the nicest, even if honestly it is less than the other films. the king's death scene is perhaps the most hateful scene in the franchise that wasn't funny at all but just pissed you off. The parody continues, even if it is less intense than the previous ones 2. I don't have much more to say: Arthur is a decent character, Prince Charming doesn't suck as a villain, but he's not on par with his mother and the story is pretty predictable in many places. It seems as if this film is only cheaper than the previous ones by not giving anything really innovative. But it's not bad. it is watchable.",Shrek the Third,Shrek the Third - Movie Reviews

3231,Mr F,"Oct 07, 2021","Starting with the most important thing about a comedy based movie: this film is endlessly hilarious and even when one joke doesn't work you know there are at least five coming up that will and that when they do work, they REALLY work. This, and the similar ways the premise is used, makes this film very similar to its predecessor but it's not quite as good in a few ways: the characters aren't boring but aren't as fleshed out in some ways, the beginning doesn't set things up badly but it's pretty obvious what will happen and it's a little less funny. Despite this, the movie is still really entertaining through it's fast paced but still mcguffin based plot and really well done performances from everyone involved. On top of this, the movie looks really cool and realistic which adds to the tension it builds, which it does really well especially in the Baboon scene. Although it definitely trys to expand the universe in which it takes place, it definitely could have used some different ideas and a MUCH better villain which is weird because this was my biggest problem with the first one. It builds to a well deserved if not a little long conclusion that left me genuinely happy about the sequel that will hopefully come in a couple of years (with covid you never can tell). What a hilarious fantasy that lives up to the previous' reputation.",Jumanji: The Next Level,Jumanji: The Next Level - Movie Reviews
3232,Stephy S,"Sep 22, 2021","A minor improvement upon its predecessor, Jumanji: The Next Level is still good fun but almost an exact carbon copy of its forerunner, that's both its biggest strength and weakness. The cast this time around is even better, returning actors deliver even better performances and the newcomers blend in without any issue. The chemistry they share has gotten even better and it's still a delight to watch! The special effects haven't changed much, they're still phenomenal but not any better than its precursor, mainly the intricate designs for the fictive creatures and the expansive landscapes were pleasing to look at. The pacing, however, is just as awful as the original, it still tries to pull off that videogame level style but hasn't improved in the slightest compared to the original, it's still just as clunky and makes some scenes unbearable to sit through. The life system they introduced before is back and this time they've improved upon it but it's still flawed. The twist of making them swap the number of lives is a unique idea but there's still no form of tension and they again get rid of those lives by killing them off for comedic purposes. The action sequences on the other hand are probably the best part of this movie, especially the bridge escape scene! They're hysterical and chaotic but not to the point where it's unclear what's going on all while making use of each character's unique attributes in a fun and quirky way. The soundtrack was just as much of a banger as before, Guns N' Roses is back and even more fun this time around and the orchestrated themes are even more exhilarating and hype! All in all, Jumanji: The Next Level is a solid thrill a minute blockbuster with enough to leave you satisfied.",Jumanji: The Next Level,Jumanji: The Next Level - Movie Reviews

The ability to connect with the original Jumanji, while also introducing a new audience to the world of Jumanji through a video game platform was interesting. Next Level returns to the same formula as Welcome to the Jungle, which kind of makes the film lose the charm and unexpected fun that came with the previous film. Next Level delivers on performances again, with Kevin Hart's character mimicking Danny Glover being a huge highlight. The action sequences are fun, but they seem repetitive, as we already had seen these character go through peril before, even with the avatar switched shenanigans making it funny. It's pretty nice to see Karen Gillan and Jack Black being in more of the forefront for the majority of the film, as it helps provide both performers more scope to showcase their comedic talents. As for the film itself, it's still a fun ride with a lot of great jokes, but it's just missing something. It seems like the movie was made as more of a bridge for the sequel (which looks like it will go back to the basics and familiarity for some of the older fans of the series).

3285,Milhouse V,"Jun 23, 2021","I think this film is really where the series begins to hit it's stride. It has expanded the world from the last film, but not so far as to distract from the story, and at this point, enough of the world has been established that it's not as distracting as it was in Chamber of Secrets. This allows the film just enough room to breath and everything is seemingly working in harmony with each other. While the films have gotten progressively darker, it is done appropriately so. Harry Potter is growing older and more experienced, so his day-to-day problems as a wizard should reflect that--all the while edging closer to his confrontation with ""He who won't be named"".",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - Movie Reviews

3288,Nguyen D,"Jun 14, 2021","LUMOS MAXIMA!! Let there be light. The third in the franchise, and we followed Harry Potter and his friends in their third year. It's worth noting that the director changed from Chris Columbus to Alfonso Cuarón. Even though this is the third, I'm still amazed at the new magic tricks that the source material created. They also became goofier and funnier. The CGI was decent for the most part, but some were noticeably bad. The biggest change from the first two was the story, which became more complexed and involved playing with time. This came with a problem for me: in the first hour and a half, I felt like the story was going nowhere, and the pieces were random. However, the ending act tied everything together and explained what happened a lot, perhaps more than it needed to, but probably for the young audiences to follow. Even though it's 20 minutes shorter than the second one, the runtime still felt very long, mostly because of the set up that seemed to go nowhere at first. It would be better if the story moved faster and connected the pieces sooner. Overall, I'm still amazed at how well and creative the script and source material used its universe to entertain audience. The story was more complex, which was good and enjoyable, but nonetheless still felt too long and lost me couple of times. 7/10",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - Movie Reviews

Cuaron is an excellent director who can seemingly turn his hand to any sort of film that comes his way, and as with every film in the series there are some good newcomers here - Emma Thompson is only briefly seen but is very good; Gary Oldman is a fine addition and the introduction of the Dementors marks the arrival of one of Rowling's most powerful, enduring and meaning-packed creations.

The film interested me from the first minutes. This movie is about Harry Potter. All parts of the film tell about the life of the boy Harry and how he fights the evil of Voldemort. The film shows a devoted friendship, as Harry is always helped by his friends and never abandoned in even the most difficult moment. The performance of the actors is so convincing that it makes you believe that it was all real. Many moments in the films are very moving and even make you worry about the character. Many moments are very spectacular, especially when Harry confronts Voldemort All the parts are very interesting and magical in their own way. In each part, the story of Harry Potter becomes more interesting, each part makes a lot of sense. This is the most interesting and gripping film from the first minutes.

3298,Puroo R,"May 12, 2021","After watching The Chamber of Secrets I was a bit skeptical to continue watching the franchise. That was what I had in mind when I began watching this - Will it also show filthy, cringy characters? Is there going to be terrible CGI with literally no beautiful locations? Are there going to be tons of disgusting scenes? Turns out this movie is better in terms of all those things. And definitely worth a watch if you haven't done it already (I know you muts have, I am the only 90's-born stooge who still hasn't watched this series). The story this time takes a much dark, complicated turn. In the beginning of the movie itself Harry kills his aunt, or so it seems since it has been left ambiguously. He doesn't even hesitate from using his magical powers to scare his family anymore, although it is never explained how his uncle knows that he's not allowed to use his powers. This time, just like every other time he is to escape from home and go to Hogwarts station. But this time he does it in a bus being driven by a ghost. I like how every time Harry has to escape from home it always happens in a funny and wholesome manner. Those are the scenes that I could watch forever without getting tired. As the series is progressing, Harry Potter is having a higher budget, which is clearly visible by the fact that now it is following the ""show, don't tell"" principle of storytelling way more often. And that's why the story is using a lot less runtime giving exposition or conversations but rather on actually doing things. I learnt this the hard way. I was doing my project on my computer while watching the movie on the phone, and I missed a lot of scenes and had to rewind to see them again. This is a habit that I had developed from the last two movies of the franchise. And I'm really happy to see that supposedly the Potterheads must have really enjoyed seeing it in the theatres or wherever they saw it. They wouldn't have wasted any time on the talkikng scenes like sci-fi movies normally do. However, I am more used to having Harry Potter having a simple story, just like the movies of that time like Narnia and Lord of the Rings. I was doing a project while watching the movie on my phone, so I stopped seeing the movie for like, 5 minutes and by then everything had changed. I never understood when Harry and Hermione went to the past and what exactly were they trying to change. I also didn't know who that guy was who sat on the flying creature and flew away. Also what finally happened of the Dementor, I completely missed out on that part. There is something about the Harry Potter movies that stops me from wanting to watch them, and I have no idea why. I also get this feeling with Stuart Little and Narnia. So I can't say for a guarantee that I will rewatch it to watch the scenes that I skipped. Although this movie is a major improvement over Chamber of Secrets, it doesn't match the standard that Sorcerer's Stone has set. I have heard enough about Harry Potter and how much it means to everyone, but personally for me it's not a franchsie I could possibly bond with for some reason. I hope I change my mind soon after future movies.",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban - Movie Reviews

Johnny Depp reprises his role as Sparrow, but doesn't succeed at giving the character the charm he has from the first movie in the franchise, though it may be the way the character is written. Javier Bardem plays the villain well, but some spoken lines early in the movie were hard for me to understand. Geoffrey Rush does a great job as always. The writing for this film seemed to make things up as the movie went on instead of maintaining or expanding the lore from the previous films, like playing a game that the rules change while you're playing, it wasn't really fun.

The movie also introduces us the a new villain witch is a intresting villain. But the movie chickens out and makes the same mistake they did with black beard, instead of prolonging their new story. Jack Sparrow is visually there on the screen, but I never felt the itself in the movie. Barbosa is given a nice story arc, but it's rushed and could easely have lasted two movies.

Barbosa is the character who wants to kill Jack (because everyone always wants to kill him). In the first movie, Jack wants to recover his ship, which is ""the black pearl"" that is commanded by Barbosa (in that movie the bad guy) whose character is hated, but in the end we all love him, he kidnaps Elizabeth (thinking that his last name was Turner), which continues to appear in the other films. Barbosa the black pearl and the crew are cursed for stealing and they spend a Mayan treasure that was given to Hernán Cortés when he arrived in America, and they try to remove the curse while Jack tries to take the ship from them and William tries to take his lover Elizabeth, it is a saga Very interesting because it combines fiction with some legends of the sea, which I find funny in some places, since Jack always tries to put a funny tone to problems.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales,Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales - Movie Reviews

There are many famous actors in this film. Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, Javier Bardem as Captain Armando Salazar, Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa, Brenton Thwaites as Henry Turner, Kaya Scodelario as Carina Smyth. The plot is very unpredictable. The undead Captain of the Silent Mary who seeks revenge on Jack Sparrow and try to steal the Trident of Poseidon to kill every pirate at sea. All the battles take place in the sea, which is very unusual. Dialogues between the characters are on pirate jargon with hard humor. It looks very convincing. Also, there are many surprising moments, for example, the death of one of the main characters. The end of the movie was amazing. While watching a film, you can't get dull.

One such reviewer said this was copied from 'Mac and Me'. All it takes is two minutes to do your research and to the person that posted that - don't spread false info. Mac and Me was released in 1988 and was a blatant rip off of E.T. This movie is a true masterpiece. I first saw it back in 1994 and it stuck with me since then. I miss those times terribly, however I can imagine how amazing it would have been to see it in cinemas back then! It is one of the best films ever created accompanied by one of the best soundtracks to ever be recorded. It is charming, funny and tear-jerking and the plot is straight to the point with each scene executed beautifully! This movie is a must watch and an all time-classic.

Steven Spielberg logra un gran trabajo y se complementan de una manera genial junto a la partitura de John Williams. A pesar de la inclinación de Spielberg por la manipulación barata, E.T. es en realidad una película bastante buena. En cuanto a lo que no me gustó es que algunas escenas duran mucho más de lo necesario (la persecución en bicicleta o mucho del inicio de la película que me pareció muy lenta) y algunos de los actores jóvenes ofrecen actuaciones no muy buenas (a pesar de esto, Drew Barrymore es genial).

Despite Spielberg's penchant for cheap manipulation, E.T. is actually a pretty good movie and manages to hit most of the right notes. It's the story of an alien who's been left behind after his ship departs Earth in a hurry after a threat from humankind and the relationship he develops with the young boy who finds him. Some scenes go on for far longer than necessary (the bike chase, for example) and some of the young actors give less than stellar performances (despite this, Drew Barrymore is great), but, overall, it's an entertaining family film that leaves you feeling satisfied, for the most part.",E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial - Movie Reviews

3368,Andrew R,"Apr 24, 2021","Simply put, ET. THE Extra Terrestrial is THE best film of the 1980's and one of the greatest American films of all time, as well as one of the most beautiful and innocent. It really deserved to win both the Best Picture and Best Director Academy Awards of 1982 over Ghandi. And Drew Barrymore deserved an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Her performance at SIX years old is simply amazing and so natural. Here in 2021 it's easily forgotten what an event ET was during the summer of 1982.....and the fact that it held the top spot on the worldwide and domestic box office for a staggering record of 15 years, until the release of Star Wars in January 1997. Any film holding the domestic box office record for 15 years now is unthinkable....although The Force Awakens $936 million seems completely untouchable now. People also forget ET was really a tiny little film, made for under 10 million dollars in 1982...somewhat low budget even in 1982. But with the king of the box office, Steven Spielberg at the helm and John Williams' INCREDIBLE Oscar winning score, ET soars like a $100 million dollar film. It's larger than life. And while we're talking about John Williams' score, incredible, powerful, triumphant and heartbreaking all at the same time. I would call his music to ET the greatest film score of all time if it weren't for Star Wars (1977). Most of us who grew up with the film know all the stories about the inception, inspiration and production of the film so theres no reason to repeat what countless reviews have said about the film. This review is strictly about the importance of the film and the pop culture phenomenon it became. Those of us who are lucky to be old enough to have seen it during it's original theatrical run in the summer of 1982 will never forget the experience. It's one of the most vivid memories from my early childhood. I remember it like it was yesterday. I saw ET for the first time on my 5th birthday, July 19th 1982. I was taken to Walmart before the film for a Skelator He-Man action figure and Castle Greyskull playset. I went to see it at the Belle Meade Theater in Nashville Tennessee, one of the oldest and nicest theaters in the south. I remember bouncing out of the car in excitement, the hot, humid summer evening air hitting me, and the bright orange summer sunset. We sat in the upper balcony, which was my first experience in a theater like that. I cried the entire way home, and my mother had to read me the ET storybook to get me to fall asleep. There are some things you never forget. And the first time seeing this beautiful film is a memory those of us 43 and older will never forget. ET will always be the true box office champ to me. And if you disliked or hated this wonderful achievement in filmmaking then I feel sorry for you because you have a cold, black heart.",E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial - Movie Reviews

The special effects and stunts are also so real - Tom Cruise even: broke his ankle in mid-air for a stunt and continued the scene, and learned to fly a helicopter for an aerobatics-stunt scene. That's what I like to call dedication right there, and it really lacks in most action movies.

Tom Cruise continues his run of insane stunts, this time jumping solo from 30,000 feet.  While the rest of the white-knuckled action is spread throughout the ever-expanding cast of MI characters.   The most notable additions in this installment are Vanessa Kirby as a mysterious intermediary, and Henry Cavill as a supposed CIA hitmen that plays more like an alpha male meathead. Kirby adds to what was already a phenomenal female talent pool, and for my money, is the real reason to continue to give these movies a chance.  Kudos to Cruise and the MI producers for helming a series that offers up female roles on par with their male counterparts.  And within the storylines themselves, it's the femmes that truly rule this former boys club, and the entire production is better for it.   Unfortunately the main storyline of a nuclear arsenal gone rouge falls flat.  Been there, done that.  After a slow start dominated by unnecessary mansplaining of the overly convoluted plot, things eventually settle in.  And they do mostly stick the landing, with an ending that wisely returns to the emotional bond of the MI core.",Mission: Impossible - Fallout,Mission: Impossible -- Fallout - Movie Reviews

3422,Abhay D,"Mar 03, 2021","One of the best directed action movies in recent years, certainly one of the best in this decade. Usually, sequels get worse and worse. Mission Impossible is the one of few movies I can think of that gets better and better with each part. It's almost unbelievable that the sixth sequel to any franchise looks this good and fresh. Interestingly, the director changed for each film in the series and this film is the first where the director team remained the same. The last three are very good, and this one is probably the best in terms of quality. An interesting story that requires attention, tense action scenes that are at the highest level. I must also mention Tom Cruise who is a masterful actor as well as an action star who participates in various stunts. Shooting, driving, racing, jumping, parkour, flying, the character did absolutely everything in a very tense film through his 140 minutes, which is not a small amount for an action film. one of the most appreciated things about Cruise is that what he does onscreen is real. He really does those leaps between buildings. (He broke his ankle on one of those leaps and shut down production for seven weeks.) He really does drive a motorcycle at high speeds against traffic. He really does fly a helicopter. Who knows what motivates this guy, but the results are incredible. The music, the stunts, the actors, the cities, and the landscapes. Everything was put together amazingly well. And an ending scene that you will never forget. And, some people may find the plot quite complicated, and it is. You really need to pay attention. I recommend watching MI5, and, if you have time, all the others. There is a reference to all of them along with the movie.",Mission: Impossible - Fallout,Mission: Impossible -- Fallout - Movie Reviews

3427,Neil V,"Oct 26, 2021","2012 is enjoyable trash that I've watched dozens of times. It's laughable at times, yet thoroughly enjoyable if you don't take it seriously. It's a mix of a really interesting premise with a mess of completely unrealistic actions scenes and subpar acting. The first 30-45 minutes are actually pretty engaging. I really enjoyed the buildup and the scientific findings. Then, it just turns into a comedy fest with a father protecting his family from near-death every five minutes. I mean, if this were to have been even the slightest bit realistic, it probably would've been regarded as a great end of the world flick. Instead, the directors chose to go with the typical Hollywood approach of over-glorifying chaotic action with no regard for plot/writing. However, said actions scenes are highly entertaining in my opinion and the ending gives you the payoff of a ""warm, fuzzy climax"", while also completely unrealistic. I regularly throw this movie on to watch in the background when I want to mindlessly watch something and for that reason alone, it's worth a watch. If you're expecting to find Oscar winning-worth performances, with a brilliant cast and writing, this probably isn't the movie for you.",2012,2012 - Movie Reviews

3442,Matthew E,"Jun 01, 2021","This movie has plenty of problems, but the special effects and hyperactive plot is enough to keep anyone watching. And I'll admit, I still come back to this movie to re-watch when I want to pass some time and satisfy disaster movie cravings. 2012 has a disaster for almost everyone. You want volcanic eruptions? Check. How about megatsunamis? It's all there. I feel like that plays a big role in why I still enjoy coming back to the movie despite it not having much of anything else going for it. I'm a sucker for disaster movies. The special effects are quite spectacular. I would even say almost too over-the-top at times. But it's certainly enough to keep anyone from turning the movie off immediately. It also helps to distract from a not so great plot, which is riddled with plenty of cliches that are all too familiar in the genre. I am a scientist, and so I'm always analyzing the science behind these movies. Of course, it's science-fiction though, so it's not exactly going to hit it right on the head. I would just love to see more movies out there that are less ""fiction-y"" and more realistic. On the flip side of the coin, while the events that transpire in the movie stem from a fictional concept, I applaud the writers for coming up with something that's not horribly derivative. Can't say I've seen a disaster flick where the end of the world is caused by neutrinos heating up the Earth's core! Everything thing else... though, is more derivative and highly predictable. I feel like some of the conflicts in the plot are a bit overdone, cliche, or otherwise unnecessary. Nonetheless, it's a disaster flick that I won't stop watching anytime soon!",2012,2012 - Movie Reviews

I tried to watch this movie a few years ago. I turned it off about halfway through, just because I was weary of the CGI special effects. They're so much like watching a cartoon. This is, without doubt, the most over the top disaster film ever made. The entire city of Los Angeles slides into the ocean, Washington D.C is obliterated, and I've lost count of the other cataclysms, but there are dozens of them. As to the characters, there is a family with young kids (there always is), the U.S president, brilliant scientists (of course), and thousands of extras, most of whom get pummeled to smithereens by toppling skyscrapers or tsunamis or exploding volcanos. Oh yeah, a giant cruise ship gets decimated by a tsunami. I liked that. I've always hated cruise ships. This movie will certainly give you your money's worth. But it's basically a 2 1/2 hour cartoon. Not a funny one, either. And there's obviously no point in raising the issue of plausibility. Cartoon's aren't supposed to be plausible.",2012,2012 - Movie Reviews

3446,Molly M,"Apr 14, 2021","Roland Emmerich delivers an apocalyptic adventure to viewers in this intense, explosive catastrophe. The film makes use of various world-ending prophecies, including the Mayan calendar to rip cities in half and crumble monuments to the ground. '2012' follows various characters across the globe as they race to save whatever's left of humanity. The film opens in India, where Dr Adrian Helmsley is called to the world's deepest copper mine, only to discover the Earth's crust is heating up quicker than expected and must rush back to the United States and present this information to the President (Danny Glover). On the other side of the country, in sunny Los Angeles, is failed author and limousine driver, Jackson Curtis. While camping with his kids, Jackson meets Charlie Frost (Woody Harrelson), a man who preaches that the end is near. What happens next leads Jackson and his family on a globe-trotting adventure to China for a shot at survival. As Jackson makes his way across the globe, Government officials Chiwetel Ejiofor and Oliver Platt try to save what they can, all the while trying to maintain law and order. Despite '2012' being a high-octane action film, Emmerich still manages to display emotion. Final phone calls to loved ones provide a sense of closure to some characters, while for others, it fills them with sorrow and guilt. The 158-minute runtime can't help but drag on, and there's a few unnecessary scenes and lines of dialogue that could've been skipped. The visual effects throughout the film are incredible, even with a few issues here and there. They're extremely detailed and do a great job of getting across just how much damage has occurred all around these characters. Co-writers Harald Kloser and Thomas Wander provide '2012' with a decent score that compliments the chaotic atmosphere of what's going on on-screen. Chiwetel Ejiofor gives a great performance as Dr Adrian Helmsley, starring opposite Oliver Platt, who gives an acerbic performance as Carl Anheuser. Glover shares a heart-wrenching scene in the White House chapel with Ejiofor, where he says 'I'll be the last President of the United States of America, do you know how that feels?' A quote like that makes viewers realise the magnitude of what's happening. John Cusack gives a superb performance as Jackson Curtis, a divorced father of two who just wants to maintain a good rapport with his kids. Oh, and if you recognise the name Jackson Curtis, that's because the character is named after the rapper 50 Cent. Emmerich was a big fan of the rapper and wanted to name his lead character after him. Something that Emmerich did well with '2012' is he gave viewers two different points of view. One from the more public, working-class side and the other from the up-high, government officials. That's something that not many action films do. Despite the film mentioning the Mayan calendar and culture, the Mayans didn't actually say that the world would end in 2012. Unless you include the end of the world, the main theme throughout '2012' would be family. Jackson Curtis tries to save his family and Adrian Helmsley gets to say goodbye to his father. Tony Delgatto (played by the late George Segal) tries to reconcile with his estranged son before being abruptly cut off. The film provokes the idea that your wealth and/or job can determine your survival, and when in extreme situations, people are willing to put a price on life, €1 billion per person to be exact. There were production plans for a TV sequel titled '2013', but it was cancelled due to budgetary reasons. In conclusion, '2012' is a chaotic catastrophe with fiery scenery and heart-warming familial moments. The film features good performances from the entire cast and keeps an equal focus on both the ends of the world, and the people who are desperate to survive.",2012,2012 - Movie Reviews

The villain is also not that interesting, and the entire story doesn't feel very original, riddled with plot clichés and conveniences throughout. About the only good things in this film are the action and the humor, which I think still lands. Where this movie is strongest is when it strays from the whole ""alien"" main plot.

Neither did I fully enjoy the maya-alien plot nor every action scene in this. Shia was miscast and his performance didn't help in the slightest to make up for that. It's not a bad performance, but he's all over the map. The material he had to work with was not strong to begin with, however. Indiana Jones was something, a David Koepp script couldn't fix. The CGI gets a lot of flac for a couple of mild blunders (compared to actually bad CGI), but really isn't that bad. The departure in the end is pretty amazing. Overall this doesn't compare to its 3 predecessors. Yet, I keep revisting this movie because watching Spielberg fail is still way more entertaining than watching other directors peak. There is still much to love about this. It is by far one of the best adventure movies of the 2000s. If it had been an off brand adventure flick, people would hold it in high regards.

3505,Jorge M,3d ago,"I watched a long time ago and I had a conflict about this film, I couldn't understand why Spider-Man 2 was considered one of the best superhero movie ever. I'll be honest, I was a kid and I didn't process the film like this days, that doesn't mean that the film didn't like in that moment. Now days, I get on the train to swear that Spider-Man 2 is the best Marvel film ever. It's an amazing mix of genre which has you on the edge of your sit during all the film. It'll thrill you, it'll make you sad, it'll amuse you, it'll make you jump out of your seat in excitement. It could be said that I am exaggerating but this film is perfect in every single aspect, the script, directing, cinematography, visual effects, the performances, editing, sound and soundtrack, achieving an unique style to be the benchmark talking about Spider-Man. It squeezes all your feelings while with a gorgeous eloquence speaks us about the importance of kindness above all. It could be summarized with great tenderness with the next verse. ""I believe there's a hero in all of us, that keeps us honest, gives us strength, makes us noble and finally allows us to die with pride. Even though sometimes we have to be steady and give up the thing that we want the most. Even our dreams """,Spider-Man 2,Spider-Man 2 - Movie Reviews

I loved mjs character in this movie because of her chooses and what she needs to do. the last thing I liked is JJJ and he was more of a character than the first movie. what I didn't like is that the CGI was kind of weird at some parts and there was still some cringe acting from the actors. also I hated all those annoying screams in this movie. but other than that this movie was amazing.",Spider-Man 2,Spider-Man 2 - Movie Reviews

Peter Parker is now graduated and is struggling to live on his own, he is struggling love wise as he cannot express his real feeling towards Mary Jane Watson, this causes Peter Parker to become a really stressed person which leads him to struggle with his responsibility to be Spider-Man, he is losing his friends as they start losing trust in him. Villain wise this is probably the best out of the 3, it goes really into detail of why the villain is the villain and later on realizes all of the actions and damage he has done which makes the villain start having inner conflicts with himself as he has to pick to archive his dreams or keep humanity safe.",Spider-Man 2,Spider-Man 2 - Movie Reviews

The acting is still perfect, and the expanding of the universe is done very well. Much like the original, the CGI still feels a bit outdated to today's standards, though it was decent enough for its time. The plot and story is arguably better, and the villain is about as well done as Green Goblin, if not better in some ways.

The first 30 minutes of the movie are an absolute blast, with real humor that lets Tobey Maguire take himself a little less seriously for a while. It starts dragging a little bit as the plot picks up, strangely, but it's got bright spots here and there until the end. Alfred Molina is all around pleasant as Doc Ock, although he comes off as a little cartoonish at times. J K Simmons is amazing as always, and I appreciated the Bruce Campbell cameo. Kristen Dunst is still passable as best, although her one-dimensional, male-dominated dialogue doesn't help. Tobey Maguire still can't make facial expressions. This movie tries to introduce some interesting ideas about mental health, responsibility, and self-care, but doesn't really develop them into anything more than ""Spider-Man kicks ass whenever the plot needs him to."" Peter has a bit of character development, but he tries his darndest to avoid it until circumstances force it on him. The ending is somewhat satisfying but overly cheesy for my taste.

3523,Jonathan K,"Oct 15, 2021","It's nice when a niche movie is confident to wear its own identity loud and proud, and this was one of the main reasons why so many, myself included, loved the Sam Raimi Spiderman film from 2001. It doesn't hurt that the film was a solid bit of what I like to call Uplifting Blockbuster entertainment, but Spiderman 2 keeps what worked with the first and adds depth and greater dimension. The villain has gone from a Charismatic Evil Baddie to a Charismatic Morally-Conflicted Baddie, the evolution of Peter and his friend Harry feels logical and realistically painful, the relationship between Peter and MJ is genuinely sweet, and even Aunt May is given a lot more time to showcase her character, and her inner strength, and her scenes with Peter about his confession to her are a serious emotional gut-punch, flawlessly and organically fused with what is otherwise a feel-good superhero action flick. Let's also throw in the fact that the CGI is a massive step-up, particularly in regards to the character animation, the action scenes are notably more intricately designed and the setpieces are actually more inventive and climactic. There's also a Transition involving sunglasses that might be my favorite Transition of any movie (or anywhere outside of some used in Sherlock). This is filmmaking at its most confident and free-flowing, and Sam Raimi is one of the best quirky filmmakers of all time, effortlessly fusing a unique and offbeat sense of fun with a big-budget adventure movie for mass audiences. If you like the genre, and don't need it to be ultra dark and pensive (the latter of which this movie sometimes is, mind you), then this is an absolute must-see, along with the first.",Spider-Man 2,Spider-Man 2 - Movie Reviews

The villain is better, Dr. Octopus is as imposing as Green Goblin and I could take him seriously, there are genuinely heart-touching moments that were almost absent in the first film, and the final 50 minutes are a spectacle. But the other side of the movie, Peter Parker's personal drama, is, like in the first film, hard to watch. Tobey and Kirsten still don't have chemistry, and consequently, the romance arc is, again, dragged (I missed Dr. Octopus during a moment). And Tobey Maguire, despite everything, is not a good actor, it's hard to empathize with him. Aunt May (looks more like grandma May) and J.K.

I very much appreciate how they've developed characters in a way that any interaction between two of them feels like fanservice. I didn't think I'd appreciate the addition of The Rock as much as I ended up liking him and while I love the previous composer, I loved the addition of the grungey rock segments in the film score. The prison fight scene with Brian pulled me out of the movie as it was too obvious that they had sped up the framrate to make the movements appear faster and more violent than they were and throughout the movie the choreography involved fight moves clearly pulled right out of WWE, like the dropkick/elbow drop combo and the chokeslam and the freaking diving headbutt of all things that took away from the realism in a way that I disliked. I also thought it was absolutely implausible that The Rock's character would agree to let the bad guy go after chasing him for so long when it literally meant endangering millions of people all for one person as that's a stupid character arc and an objectively poor decision. He should've just shot the dude right away before he could call the kidnapper since that's pretty much how they prevented Mia's death anyway, jamming his phone. And the bad guy's radical switch from calculated smart guy to bloodthirsty dumb guy was poorly written.

3622,Puroo R,"May 08, 2021","It is not very common for highly successful superhero movies that explore a new genre have an equally successful sequel. Superman and Superman II, Iron Man and Iron Man 2, Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, there are plenty of examples where a great movie is followed by a mediocre or even a bad sequel. But this one is definitely not one of them. Rather I like Deadpool 2 more than its prequel. Since the previous movie was more set up in order to give an origin story and have the regular good guy vs bad guy fight, it did not have much time to explore over its humour. And this is exactly where Deadpool 2 does the job. The story revolves around Wade Wilson once again with his popping over his wife's death by a bunch of mercenaries and alongside that he is trying to save a boy from becoming a supervillain and getting killed by Cable. This movie it takes itself very lightly just like the prequel and breaks the fourth wall continuously as the story passes by. There is even a joke on Josh Brolin playing the role of cable as Deadpool says, ""Suck it, Thanos!"". Multiple comic scenes take place throughout the movie e which include the formation of the X-Force, Deadpool being made an X-Men trainee and no one taking him seriously, Wade Wilson been sent to prison, Deadpool fighting Cable and releasing all the mutants only to be ripped in half by Juggernaut and Deadpool growing out as a baby from the bottom half. The action scenes of this movie are even better than the previous one. I really like the scene from the beginning of the movie where Deadpool is fighting a bunch of Yakuzas in Osaka. The camera revolves around Deadpool as he slices down all the man who have come to save the leader. When juggernaut and colossus are about to fight Deadpool says, ""Big CGI fight coming up!"". When he is about to fight cable for the first time, Cable ask him who he is to which he replies, ""I am Batman!"". Overall there are multiple action comedy scenes sprinkled all across the movie. The movie also gives an important message, which is not something we normally see in an X-Men movie. Deadpool tells Russell to let the headmaster live, as killing him would send him on the path of villainy from which it will be impossible to come back. Instead of Russell Deadpool chooses to take the bullet from Cable and his death becomes the reason why Russell chooses to give up killing and become a good person instead. This also saves Cable's family from dying and he can go back in peace. But soon afterwards that message is discarded after the headmaster is run over by Dopinder's taxi, thus fulfilling his dream of becoming a contract killer. Deadpool 2, being the movie for a mature audience as it is, is hard to think of home to watch with, considering such a movie cannot be watched with the family and friends have watched it anyway. This is the reason why it's a good thing they decided to make a sequel of this movie and connect it to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If Dark Phoenix and The New Mutants were not made, this could have been the most perfect way to culminate the X-Men franchise and merge it with the remaining Marvel Cinematic Universe. I can't wait to watch more of this.",Deadpool 2,Deadpool 2 - Movie Reviews
3623,Simon O,"Apr 12, 2021","One of those extraordinary films that is hilarious, clever, visually stunning and emotionally potent too! The most enjoyable superhero movie.",Deadpool 2,Deadpool 2 - Movie Reviews
3624,Jonathan K,4d ago,"Deadpool shows the power of a well-written screenplay, which is fast, sharp, incredibly funny and immensely self-aware without ever staying in the dreaded ""meta"" zone for more than a few seconds at a time (like Deadpool mocking Ryan Reynolds as only being successful because he's good looking). The main hero has a woefully cynical worldview, but he is actually extremely observant, and isn't just cynical due to viewing the world via an emotional skew - there is bad in the world, from the little injustices that everybody simply lets go, to the uneven value placed on human lives based on the circumstances, and his dark jokes about these things actually feel like a raunchier version of something George Carlin might have come up with. And on that note, yes - This movie is overpoweringly raunchy, so if this is not something you enjoy, then you have no business being here. Luckily, the movie has a lot more than just comedy to offer. It features a surprisingly somber story of a mildly deformed man running away from the eyes of the one he loves, which is actually quite touching. And along with that, the movie has a fair amount of action and some moments of genuine intensity, and both of these aspects are very well done; while Tim Miller might have made the most Poorly-Directed Terminator movie with Dark Fate, his Directing of Deadpool is absolutely spot-on, nailing the humor, heart and adrenaline almost flawlessly. It's not a perfect movie, but mostly because its unique and extreme style of humor, much of it winking to the camera, is so consistent that it does eventually get slightly tiresome - it's like listening to 3 Weird-Al albums back-to-back; it's always funny, but the humor is so consistent that it just wears off after a while. But if ultra-dark and raunchy humor work for you, as does some surprisingly brutal violence, then I cannot recommend Deadpool enough. I absolutely loved it and plan on watching it numerous times moving forward.",Deadpool,Deadpool - Movie Reviews

3678,Jonathan K,"Oct 18, 2021","George Lucas isn't quite the most creative person in the history of Hollywood, but he was creative in the exact right way at the exact right time, inventing not only a unique fusion of genres (that proved way more successful than even he could have imagined) but a new type of special effects approach (moving the camera around an object, rather than the opposite like everyone else). The original Star Wars represents the pinnacle of a simple story with a hidden depth when examined closer. The world is well realized, the villains incredibly intimidating and memorable, what is and is-not possible is well established quickly, and it largely plays out as a feel-good movie with a few moments of genuine tension or drama. Mix in good performances, likable characters, awesome action sequences and some of the best audio (both music and sound effects) of any movie, and you've got a movie that has, and will forever, stand the test of time.",Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,Star Wars: Episode IV -- A New Hope - Movie Reviews

3681,Alex J,"Sep 28, 2021","What made Hollywood and gave the foundation to the sci-fingenre. Star Wars. A simple story about galatic governments, smugglers, space wizards, space ships and robots. This idea of film sounded absolutely insane in 1977. But for George Lucas it was a story, his story. That he believe was worth telling. All these years later, it sure did pay off. Not only is the film simple to follow, but the characters are likeable, then set pieces and score are fantastic. It's all great and is a solid film. I highly recommend any film goer to gives this a shot, and see what the hype is all about.",Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,Star Wars: Episode IV -- A New Hope - Movie Reviews

All of the development for the Galaxy, force and many other aspects is done in a very efficient way which allows the viewer to be excited for an expanding galaxy and hence why the franchise still runs over 40 years after this film. Given the year it was made, 1997, this movie has some very impressive special effects, better than some you see nowadays in 2021. Despite limited screen time, Darth Vader immediately established himself as a legendary villain thanks to his menacing presence and his ability to steal every scene he is in.

3686,Colton S,"Aug 30, 2021","A legendary ambitious start to the ever-expanding star wars saga, George Lucas opened our eyes to new possibilities of blockbuster filmmaking and things have never been the same since audiences have seen that opening crawl for the first time. Starting in the middle of the story(Episode IV) It is a thrilling adventure of young farmboy Luke Skywalker who with the help of old Jedi master obi-wan Kenobi follows his hero's journey and begins learning the ways of the force and become a Jedi himself as he and hotshot smuggler Han solo along with wookie Chewbacca(captain and co-pilot of the Millennium Falcon), work together with the companionable droid duo of R2-D2 and C-3PO to rescue princess leia, and help the Rebel Alliance in their fight to restore freedom and justice to the Galaxy as they go up against menacing Darth Vader and his waves of imperial storm troopers. The story is a perfect morality tale as good goes up against evil and it feeds people's hunger for adventure, thrills ,and comedy. This 1977 film is a classic and with the story, John William's brilliant musical scores and the huge leaps that it takes with special effects and other filmmaking techniques(which were many building blocks towards even better techniques for modern filmmaking) this film will live on in people's hearts and minds for generations but don't take my word for it, go out there and see it for yourself!!! no longer will you have to fear about not knowing what the force is or what a wookie is or even how many languages C-3P0 can speak, this film is the perfect first steps into a larger world!

3687,James M,"Aug 25, 2021","Some kind of movie magic happened when Star Wars was made. From the reported chaos of its production, somehow everything fell into place by the time the final film was released: the perfect cast, groundbreaking special effects, amazing sound effects, great editing, an awesome music score and a fantastic adventure story with not one, but two, very different heroes taking centre stage. Star Wars has a level of realism, showing us a futuristic world where technology is fully integrated into people's daily lives, and everything has a ‘used' look that made it seem very real. The iconic opening shot, with an absurdly massive Star Destroyer crawling across the screen in chase of some hopelessly outgunned little space ship, informed us that this was a world unlike any we had seen before - a place far, far away and in another time, just as the opening credits had promised. The central robot characters R2D2 and C-3PO were both believable and likeable. It was an inspired choice to have only one of the robot speak English, with the other one left to communicate through simple electronic beeps, leaving us searching for meaning in the robot's simple movements and head turns. Mark Hamill was perfectly cast as Luke Skywalker, the naive young farm boy who gets caught up in a galactic war with rebellious freedom fighters. Hamill's boyish good looks made him very relatable to the young fan base, many of whom dreamed of being Luke Skywalker long after they had left the movie theatre. Carrie Fisher was also good as the beautiful but sassy Princess Leia, and Harrison Ford announced his arrival as the alternate hero Han Solo. The story never labours, instead moving at a solid pace as one small adventure unfolds into the next. There are moments of genuine emotional depth, such as when Luke looks out over the Tatooine landscape towards the planets dual setting suns. as if longing for the future to arrive. There is also great action and adventure as the movie progresses to it climatic battle against the awesome Death Star. Star Wars still looks fresh today, and can be enjoyed over and over again.",Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,Star Wars: Episode IV -- A New Hope - Movie Reviews

But believing that people centuries ago sprinkled clues throughout their work, trusting that every hidden clue would survive centuries of world events (including two world wars as it turns out) and also trusting that people centuries later would find and correctly interpret and follow those clues.... What utter horse****. . Right now it's possible that i am getting my terrible films mixed up, but i think that there are even clues that could only be found because of technology like x-rays. And there is no way anyone living 500 years ago could have predicted that tech, not even DaVinci himself. . It's laughable. And this is laughably bad.

3774,Matt F,"Jul 18, 2021","Wow. Just wow. This isn't a superhero movie or even a sci fi and is not in the same genre; people must learn what that is, instead it's more like a special effects packed action fuelled fast paced blockbuster with brilliant technology, style, money and humour. You can expect the level of nonsense nowadays more so because most of the fast and furious entries lately have been too over the top they were from the start. Now, you've the very best in action stars Jason Statham who at only five foot nine took the usual hammering in terms of a roasting from the Americans. Plus you've Dwayne who looked amazing in this until the later stages when he appeared to have lost his entire pump with the amount of work he had put in. The two characters got at one another in the same way Kevin hart does which was fun at first then became tiring. The film was at its best when it was more serious. Future tip dial down the undue excess, dial down the immature phrases and dial down the special effects and you've instead of showing off all the money most of the cities you filmed in just do not have, actually use what was best in the film, old school and charisma. Special mention for the females in this movie, the extras including the army of bad guys were very poor in this almost made this comic book like, but the female lead did her part even if she was just a spare part towards the end. Statham was bound to produce coming from some silly films such as spy and the Meg, whereas Dwayne had to pump up to de-emphasise his ageing stubble, the two looked remarkable they got on well. Jason is better when he's no nonsense serious and so is the rock with that added humour and banter. Although at times this went too far like with Ryan Reynolds to be taken as a serious movie this annoyed me. The audience compared this too much to the franchise which is just as mad, finally less irrelevance on super cars and more on actually showing us just how sensational these two men are.",Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw - Movie Reviews

3787,Kyle C,"Jun 17, 2021","The first two thirds of this movie are a little bit of a slog - it takes a while for the story to get going and for the cast to really have anything to work with, and most of the action up until this point has been generic and really nothing special. A lot of the CGI is obvious and awkward. But the final act in Samoa is so exciting, beautiful, and action-packed that it pretty much redeems everything we went through to get there. Dwayne Johnson finally gets his chance to shine in this installment, showcasing some solid fight choreography while also showing surprising restraint in the humorous and emotional scenes. Jason Statham also gets a lot of redemption (as does his character), making him a lot more likable in this film than in the previous F&F installments. Although it's marketed along with and takes place in the Fast & Furious universe, this film is firmly NOT a Fast & Furious film (which is ultimately for the best). For one thing, Hobbs & Shaw is almost entirely a buddy comedy film, with a good bit of action and some emotional scenes thrown in. Ryan Reynolds is funny and unexpected, although Kevin Hart's character felt altogether unnecessary. Although it's much more of a traditional action film than what we're used to in this franchise, it stands on its own pretty well and gives the leads a chance to shine apart from the bloated cast of the main series.",Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw - Movie Reviews
3788,Dale R,"Nov 15, 2021","The origin story of the character from Disney's Sleeping Beauty animated film done in live action starring Angelina Jolie. This film is not a live action remake of the original film, instead making the villain of the original the protagonist of her own film. Maleficent is one of my favorite villain characters of all time and I wish they would have told the original story (expanded for time) from the villain's point of view. Instead they ruin the characters of the good fairies and Maleficent herself. Angelina Jolie is perfectly cast as the title character and does a great job in the role. The scene taken from the original movie when she curses Aurora as a child was really well done.

Between the hype, a sequel & Jolie, I expected magnificent special effects, adventure, and an epic character study of a good-hearted-girl-turned-evil queen. It has great effects; I will give it that. But, where the film fails is in its character-arc. Rather than display Maleficent's gradual transition, the film spends a max of 4 minutes, where Jolie goes from a weepy girl having lost her wings, to a woman limping in frustration, to an villainous queen seated on a thrown of her own making (and with a pair of body guards lookin like undead versions of Groot). This is not character development. And, there is also very little to be said for the man she loves, who ultimately becomes the rival King. His portrayal falls flat, but I'd can hardly blame. The character is one dimensional with dialogue to match. And, his betrayal, with no buildup, makes about as much sense as Maleficent's turn to the darkside. Might have to skip the sequel.",Maleficent,Maleficent - Movie Reviews

3800,Thomas R,"Sep 01, 2021","There are people here who are disappointed that this movie has no resemblance to the animated movie from decades ago...but that is presumably the intended idea. The movie is certainly scary and violent without being gory, but definitely don't take little kids to see this one. It will be quite unsuited for them. Maleficent begins life as an immature fairy in a beautiful, harmonious fairy world next to a conventional and harsh kingdom. She is visited by Stefan, a boy of a similar age from the kingdom, who implies that someday he will live in the king's castle. An innocent romance begins, but soon ends as the boy grows older, and the current ruler of the kingdom attempts to invade the fairy world with his army to steal its treasures, only to fail. As the old king is dying, Stefan claims the throne by amputating and stealing the fairy's wings. He gets the crown, marries, and has a baby daughter...only for the now-embittered and vengeful Maleficent to arrive and place a curse on the daughter. Stefan is forced to have his daughter raised by three fairies to try to keep her safe...and in the process, becomes embittered and vengeful himself. But over the years, as the daughter grows up, unaware of what had happened, Maleficent sees her and starts having second thoughts. But the cold war has started between Maleficent and Stefan; can Maleficent undo the damage she has done? Like most characters in recent fairy tale-themed movies, nobody is entirely good or evil, and everyone is the victim of the attitudes of their respective cultures and eras. Good for teenagers or above, but too upsetting for the young kids.",Maleficent,Maleficent - Movie Reviews

Angelina Jolie is obviously incredible, the visuals and CGI are mostly impressive, I really like the score for this movie and there's some really epic and emotional moments in this movie like the action scene against the king, Maleficent cursing Aurora and the entire 3rd act. It's quite impressive and can get pretty violent for a Disney movie. But by far the biggest issue with the movie is the pacing. This movie drags on so many times during the 2nd act, especially the scenes with Aurora discovering the moors and it just isn't interesting but overall, it's a good time. I enjoy it.",Maleficent,Maleficent - Movie Reviews
3812,Mitchell C,"May 30, 2021","Maleficent is such a disappointing watch for a few reasons. The first 20 minutes were icky, with the child actresses not being the most expressive. The start of the movie just felt like a huge waste of time, but when Maleficent got her wings cut off by her boyfriend who went psycho on her for a really dumb reason, I thought the movie might pick itself up. It did indeed do this... for about 5 minutes. Evil Maleficent was intimidating for a few seconds and how she put a curse on the princess for revenge, but then Maleficent kind of just picked on Aurora (the princess) and then they became best friends 5 minutes later because Maleficent related to her? Then Aurora goes to her father's castle after finding out Maleficent put a curse on her. But when Aurora gets to the castle and meets her dad, the dad just goes, ""L.O.L, I told those stupid fairies to deliver you the day after today."" And then the king just locks the princess up with no compassion at all. The final battle was pretty lame. Maleficent just drops the king, learns some stupid moral, the end. The film's pacing is really off, wasting the first twenty minutes with bad acting and a dumb twist villain, then rushing Maleficent's redemption 10 minutes later with the movie not giving you enough room to see Aurora's personality. To top it all off, the movie ends with a rushed out ending. Don't even get me started on the side characters. Everyone here is so unlikeable. For instance, the fairies aren't as fun in this movie as they were in the original movie. These fairy's just end up not even caring for Aurora. The crow (who's the best character in this movie) does a better job of looking after Aurora than the fairy's could ever do. The king is just really angry for no rhyme or reason, yes his child was cursed, but he just shoves her to the side in the final act like I just said. Maleficent her self is just pathetic, she just ends up being soft, but since she's the good guy, she actually ends up bing pretty likeable. But since she's just a big softy now, all of her intimidation she had in the original is gone. The movie takes itself too seriously at times as well, with the closest thing too funny is when Maleficent is picking on Aurora when she was little. In conclusion, just go watch sleeping beauty.",Maleficent,Maleficent - Movie Reviews

3832,Tristen M,4d ago,"After watching it for the first time in maybe 3 or 4 years and thinking about it. I don't think I hate Amazing Spider-Man 2 anymore! Is it convoluted? Absolutely. Is there too much in it that goes absolutely nowhere (mainly because they were questions to be answered in a conclusive chapter of a trilogy) yes maybe a little too much! Are the origins for the villains a little cheesy or bad? Maybe they weren't bad maybe it was just the execution of it because I could be wrong but I think they draw heavily from Ultimate Spider-Man comics. BUT the score is incredible, of every single Spider-Man movie we've ever had ASM2 is the absolute most gorgeous and visually stunning. No movie is this fucking cool looking. Andrew gave his performance 110% and his chemistry with everyone even someone giving as bad a performance as Dane DeHaan seems to work for the movie it is. Every actor gives everything they've got in this and you can tell, it's not like Spider-Man 3 where you can tell that almost nobody cared and because everyone's acting is so good in this the emotional moments do hit and they often hit hard!!! Honestly this to me has the best, most accurate portrayal of Peter Parker; funny and smart as hell that's not just trying to impress Mr.Stark, what he doesn't know we see him actually try to figure out without the solution being ""Oh Mr.Stark put this in my suit already!"" Most of my issues with this movie has always been that I hate (and still do) that a looooot of the plot is heavily solved through pure coincidence. That whole plane massacre sequence at the beginning of the movie where Richard Parker is fighting for his life to try and upload his confession video not to send it to a news station, not to send it to someone he knows will do something good like Ben or another scientist, not the police, he sends it to his private computer currently sitting in a secret laboratory under an decades abandoned subway terminal that you only have access to by inserting in these specific slightly different subway tokens that are hidden inside his calculator that Peter only found because he got mad and threw the calculator and it broke and it just so happens that the video sent was also an apology to grown up Peter. Yeah that's absolutely convoluted and even with my newfound respect and even liking for the movie thinks that whole thing should have been cut. But look at the villains, all the groundwork is there. Their stories are actually well grounded and good, it's just the performances that made them seem stupid. Max Dillon becoming Electro; he's a man whose always belittled, bullied at work by EVERYONE despite being one of the top people in his field, has no friends had to buy his own birthday cake and sing Happy Birthday to himself that when he finally gets power he can exact the revenge on those who've wronged him! That's an awesome origin story it was just the weird direction in how Jamie Fox, who I don't blame for the bad performance, director Mark Webb other than Amazing Spider-Man had only done indie romcoms. And even with the weird writing and directing Jamie Fox gave it his all. Harry Osborne his mom died and his dad never cared about him, sent him away when he was really you and rarely if ever saw him or thought about him again. The first time he sees his father in years he's on his death bed saying ""Hey, this disease I have. Guess what? It's genetic haha!"" Then he has to learn to trust Peter because everytime he's made a friend or thought he did they only liked him for his money! And I do like that subplot of Oscorp trying to push out Harry but trying to figure out how. That too is great groundwork for the bad guy. Now this I do blame Dane DeHaan for because he's reacting to everything right but there's still just something about his performance that makes it seem cringey. Paul Giamatti gave the worst performance of his career as the rhino but hey no movie no matter how great is perfect. But the fight choreography in this is Incredible, it's not like a lot of superhero movie fight scenes where either it's too dark or the camera is too shaky and you can't see what's happening or there's a lot of weird cuts and transitions that you still can't see what's happening. This was a for a while my absolute least favorite comic book movie right up there with shit like Superman 4 and Batman Forever and Robin but being that I haven't watched this in years I do admit this is now a guilty pleasure. It's by no means simply due to the plot issues a good movie but I do enjoy the good aspects a lot more now.",The Amazing Spider-Man,The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - Movie Reviews

Plus, the storyline does not make sense, the main problem being: Max Dillon idolizes Spider-Man before becoming Electro but becomes a villain after becoming Electro. 🙄 And for reasons I cannot explain, the death of Gwen Stacy just wasn't moving. Terrible handling of an iconic part of Spider-Man's story.",The Amazing Spider-Man,The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - Movie Reviews
3837,Ellie C,"Nov 09, 2021","While disappointing after the first one, the second one still has a strong enough script and an amazing cast: Emma Stone, Andrew Garfield, Sally Field, Dane DeHaan, Jamie Foxx. DeHaan was an absolute standout in this movie and he completely stole the show. His portrayal of Harry Osborn is my personal favourite- he manages to make us feel pity, disgust, annoyance, and empathy, all at different points for this tortured character. I would have loved to have seen more of DeHaan's abilities and talent in the ASM franchise. *SPOILER ALERT* Marc Webb's directing is absolutely phenomenal and genius. When Aunt May reveals that Peter's father was a traitor, the camera angle tilts- Peter's work has been turned on it's side, it has become askew. Later, when Peter finds the Subway train and finds out the truth about his father and his work, the camera rights itself- Peter's world is righted.",The Amazing Spider-Man,The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - Movie Reviews

Além de o Rhino ter menos de 30 minutos de tela em em um filme de 2,20 horas, e ser completamente desnecessário. Em contrapartida, o Electro tem uma origem que chega a ser até melhor que a das HQs, apesar de ter uma motivação meio estranha.Mas ele é um bom vilão, e é o ponto forte do filme junto com o homem aranha.",The Amazing Spider-Man,The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - Movie Reviews

Los efectos especiales son impresionantes, el spiderman de Marc Web tiene el mejor balanceo, Peter en esta pelicula tiene sin dudas el MEJOR traje de spiderman en el cine, el Soundtrack es espectacular y la muerte de Gwen Stacy hizo llorar a mas de uno. esta pelicula tambien tiene fallas, villanos como Rhino realmente no tienen importancia en la trama y salio muy poco en pantalla, al igual que el duende verde. Electro si fue un buen villano y creo que de hecho es el mejor de esta saga de peliculas, aunque pudieron haberle dado mas profundidad al personaje.

3846,Rafael R,"Oct 15, 2021","WARNING: THIS REVIEW HAS SPOILERS! The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the worst Spider-Man film until then. The cast from the first movie still does a great job, but none of the new characters works. Harry Osborn is a poor version of the emo Tobey Maguire with a bit of Draco Malfoy. The actor is terrible and his arc is badly developed and also rushed. Electro is the worst Spider-Man villain in the cinema of all time. Jamie Foxx here is as invisible as his character, who has no motivation for hating Spider-Man (Lizard also didn't have, but at least he was imposing). And the romantic arc, which was masterfully done in the first film, becomes a ""To All the Boys 3"" but with Noah Centineo's character being the protagonist. There's no history. The best things of this film are: it deepens on Peter's parents backstory, the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone still works and Gwen's death is painful and touching.

Infelizmente o filme acabou se perdendo por causa de tantos subplots envolvendo futuros projetos para essa franquia que acabou sendo cancelada... Eu consegui me divertir muito com esse filme. Acho que foi o único filme que me deixou com um ar de ""o que acontece agora""? Infelizmente o 3° filme não aconteceu, e eu sempre me pergunto como seria o 3° filme. ""Teria sido melhor ou pior que os 2 primeiros?"" O Espetacular Homem-Aranha 2 tem comédia, romance, ação. Tudo o que um filme do Homem-Aranha deveria ter. Esse filme é uma das adaptações dos quadrinhos do Homem-Aranha simplesmente perfeita, tanto que parece que estamos assistindo o Homem-Aranha ultimate em live action. A atuação do Andrew e da Emma também ajudaram a salvar o filme. A trilha sonora também não peca, Hanz Zimmer caprichou nessa. Não me arrependo do que vou dizer... Esse é um dos filmes preferidos de comic-book. Os efeitos especiais desse filme são uma coisa de outro mundo. Marc Webb nos entregou um filme ""puro"" Homem-Aranha, e ele fez isso muito bem. Infelizmente a Sony atrapalhou cortando cenas importantes para o desenvolvimento de muito personagens, como por exemplo da Felicia, ou do Max, que infelizmente acabaram sendo esquecíveis.

3856,Stephy S,"Sep 01, 2021","Even more of a mixed bagged than its predecessor, The Amazing Spider-man 2 improves on the good parts of the original like its protagonist and the chemistry between the cast, but it butchers so much stuff. The saddest part is, it felt like director Marc Webb had a clear vision for the sequel but the studio interfered and forced him to shove another villain in at the last second. Speaking of villains, one is poorly written and just lazy, and green goblin's development is just non-existent. The pacing is god awful during the second act and every subplot feels out of place, the sinister six setup feels like Sony was just trying to make more money by teasing them and the story arc of Peter's parents (if you can even call it a story arc) has no place in the story and doesn't have a satisfying pay off. Nothing we learn about them is something that subverts our expectations, it's all old news. That being said, Peter Parker, Gwen Stacy, their relationship and Gwen's death scene are all phenomenal. It's strange seeing Marc Webb being able to deliver on arguably the most powerful death scene in any movie, and then also be the man responsible for Electro and Green Goblin. There's not much more I can say that hasn't been said yet, it's corporate pandering, it's lazily written and could've been so much more if they just focussed on one villain and expanded on the dynamic between said villain and Peter. If only there had been a The Amazing Spider-man 3, maybe that would've been the golden child of the series.",The Amazing Spider-Man,The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - Movie Reviews

The last chapter to the popular Hunger Games movie series that broke literary sales records, made Jennifer Lawrence's career and influenced young girls everywhere to take up archery is finally coming to a close... well sort of. This is only part 1 of the final chapter. In it's infinite wisdom, Lionsgate films has decided to take the Harry Potter route in finishing off the Hunger Games series. What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said about the second to last Harry Potter movie? Some may call this film a necessary bridge to the final chapter of the series, others may call it a gradual build to something far grander in scale than what we've seen before in other Hunger Games films. Some may say that but the fact of the matter is, this movie is just plain old fashioned filler. Trust me, I've read the books and the only thing you're seeing in this film is pure filler. I don't think I'm giving anything away by telling you that The third book of the Hunger Games saga depicts the events of a massive war between the capital and the other districts but it's not ALL just a battle, there are quite a few pieces of plot that need to occur leading up to the epic spectacle of war, things that the makers of the Hunger Games film series would rather just get out of the way than have them share the spotlight with what is sure to be the special effects event of fall 2015. I could go on and tell you about everything else in the film as far as the cast and the story and the special effects but honestly, nothing has changed since the last film. Everyone does a good job and the film ends up where it needs to be but the overarching feeling behind it all is that it all of it adds up to being just a bunch of Hollywood BS stretching out projects for no reason. There's no real reason for this movie to exist, everything that happens here could have been explained in the first 20-30 minutes for the most part, Lionsgate just decided that they wanted to line their coffers with a little more coin before this franchise ends. Eh, who can blame them. Money is money after all. Unfortunately it doesn't add up to a very entertaining ride for everyone else in the theater. All in all, if you're a fan of The Hunger Games films, you're seeing this for only one reason, to get to part 4 where the real action is. If you're just a casual fan, I'd say read the back of the DVD case or the wiki synopsis and hell, just watch the trailer and prepare yourself for part 4 because that's what you should be paying to see, not this. Perhaps I'll have a different opinion of the series once part 2 of Mocking Jay comes out, but as it stands right now on it's own, Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 gets a 2.5...out of 5",The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 - Movie Reviews"

It makes for an intense , suspenseful political thriller that allows the viewer to take in what happens by not moving too fast. The Hanging Tree sequence is probably my favorite in the franchise, the score is remarkable and the action that is around is great.

3901,Matthew D,"Jun 16, 2020","A smart political drama to get teenagers involved in politics. Francis Lawrence's coming of age sci-fi political drama The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 (2014) is an interesting installment in a franchise built on blood, then goes deeper into social dynamics and what it takes to create a revolution. Suzanne Collins' writing is interesting as she acknowledges the need for political propaganda in order to maintain order and unite the districts. Mockingjay - Part 1 sets up for the grand finale with style and class as Katniss must film President Snow's atrocities to inform and unite all people to her righteous cause. I think Lawrence finds fresh perspective on teenagers rebelling and relating to these heroes with his slick direction. I must mention that Lorde is on the soundtrack for this movie. Her astonishing dream pop anthem ""Yellow Flicker Beat"" calls on the youth to rebel and be themselves with frightening majesty. I love how it's the last thing you hear in the movie as the end credits start to play. Likewise, James Newton Howard's score has never been more evocative and emotional, especially towards the end of Mockingjay. I love his music for this fiery franchise. Jennifer Lawrence is incredible as empathizing with Katniss Everdeen and the struggle of an oppressed people. The Hunger Games movies mean more than entertainment, but a warning against allowing your society to crumble. We should all be rising together like Katniss in these turbulent times. Lawrence is inspiring, lovely, and haunting as the distraught and conflicted Katniss trying to do what she believes is right. Josh Hutcherson is excellent as the captured Peeta Mellark, painfully tortured and forced to deliver half-hearted messages to the Mockingjay revolution. Liam Hemsworth is interesting as the conflicted Gale Hawthorne, who wants to be there for the already spoken for Katniss, while fighting alongside his people. Woody Harrelson is outstanding as the heartfelt Haymitch Abernathy, standing alongside Katniss through it all. Elizabeth Banks is increasingly emotional as the entertaining eccentric Effie Trinket. Julianne Moore is fantastic as the cold and calculating President Alma Coin. She bears a knowing confidence I find revealing. Rest in paradise to the ever amazing Philip Seymour Hoffman as the crafty architect of the Mockingjay revolution Plutarch Heavensbee. Jeffrey Wright is more clever and cunning than ever as the technical genius Beetee. Stanley Tucci is more underhanded as the propaganda announcer Caesar Flickerman. Donald Sutherland is more vindictive and vicious than ever as President Snow. His calm fury is fascinating to watch unfold on the masses. Willow Shields is very emotive as Primrose Everdeen with her hurt looks and helpful healing practices as a revolutionary nurse. Sam Claflin was awesome in Catching Fire and he's captivating with his dark dramatic performance as Finnick Odair. Jena Malone gets a memorable cameo as Johanna Mason. I wish she were in more of Mockingjay. Mahershala Ali is cool as Katniss' new protector Boggs. Natalie Dormer is cool and gorgeous as the propaganda director Cressida. Ve Neill's make-up for Dormer is so wonderful with her green tattoos and undercut hairstyle. The costumes in Mockingjay are all wicked armor with plenty to love. Philip Messina's harsh industrial production design is striking like Jo Willems' vivid cinematography. I love his wide shot of Katniss shooting down two jets with her bow. The close-up of Jennifer Lawrence's face to the jets is killer. Lastly, Alan Edward Bell and Mark Yoshikawa's snappy editing makes Mockingjay's 123 minutes fly by like the bird. In all, Mockingjay is not as phenomenal as The Hunger Games or Catching Fire, but it inspires a sense of anarchy and rebellion in you for sure.",The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 - Movie Reviews"

3906,Zach L,"May 30, 2020","Once you grow up and realize the realities of conflict, inner turmoil and the fight to do what's right, you hopefully lose any immature attachments to fleeting fancies of the heart. Sadly, this film doesn't recognize that. Collins wrote these books for a YA audience but the stakes within the plot are so high that the naive YA heart tugs are a fatal error. Katniss and Peeta's love story arc was never fully developed in the first place , so for her to be so hung up on Peters fate that it causes her to play the reluctant hero role is outright silly. There are scenes early on in this film where Katniss is screaming and crying over poor Peters fate that is supposed to make us feel for her quest for love, instead it's just a childish distraction. Had she stepped into the hero role and been mature enough to know that none of her allies had any choice in the impending revolution, thus meaning Peeta no harm, it would have been such a stronger and more well defined study in the rise of the Mockingjay. It's like you're watching a 14 year old Tiger Beat mellowdrama play out for no good reason. All that aside, the dystopian vision of censorship, power and mind control from within governmental systems is well thought out and worth the trip down the rabbit hole. The heroines conviction for the cause does bloom eventually, thank God. Otherwise, this film would be a waste of time.",The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 1 - Movie Reviews"

It never was about stupid kids shit it was always about emotional growth. Shrek forever after hit the spot and showed us at the start what the series had become and how he grown sick of it. He then realised what he lost and for the first time in the series he cried. When she couldn't get his reality back he put his selfish self out of the picture and tried to help phiona have a better life. Rumblestinkings unlike other villains he actually won and outsmarted everyone he was a masterpiece of a villain.

3911,Pedro G,"Oct 28, 2021","Muy buena película, sin duda un digno final y definitivamente el mejor ejemplo de una obra infravalorada. Es una pena lo poco apreciada que está esta película. Creo que fue el resultado de la tercera entrega, y el mal sabor que dejó la franquicia. Al volver a ver la película, me sirvieron mucho los temas maduros que toca y su profundidad en los personajes. Uno de mis aspectos favoritos de la película, es el antagonista 'Rumpelstiltskin', quizás no es el mejor (ya que para mi sigue siendo el hada madrina) pero es muy memorable. Por otro lado, me gustaron mucho todas las escenas emocionantes que te dejan al borde del llanto, o llorando directamente. Esto hace que no sea tan divertida como las dos primeras películas, pero me gusta por donde llevaron esta película, dándole un toque diferente. Por otro lado, la película no iguala a la primera ni obviamente a la segunda, pero por lo menos es un digno final de la franquicia y no es olvidable para nada. También me gustó mucho el soundtrack de la película y la animación es genial, se nota una gran evolución en cuanto a las anteriores y que se gasto mucho mas presupuesto esta vez. Destaco mucho también el doblaje latino que sigue siendo muy bueno. Por último, el final es muy satisfactorio, dejando un mensaje hermoso y un montaje musical con la misma canción del final de la primera película; concluyendo con los créditos mostrando escenas icónicas de toda la saga, simplemente hermoso. En conclusión, una película incomprendida con un final muy digno que se mantiene fresca gracias a las hermosas animaciones, el gran desarrollo de Shrek y una buena historia.

3939,Italian G,"Mar 13, 2021","This review contains spoilers. I honestly don't understand all this hatred of the movie. I didn't grow up with the Shrek saga: during the lockdown I saw all 4 films in order. And for someone who saw the film for the first time, I found it a great product. The animations are a big improvement over the previous 3 films and the characters are beautiful to look at. The story is very controversial, but I found it to be in full swing with the franchise, because let's be honest: Shrek never really changed his temper. It certainly hasn't stayed where it started, but evolution is minimal. Here, finally, he manages to have a real evolution in line with the character. In my opinion, Shrek has not undergone a regression, but only a wave of nostalgia that blinded him. The idea of going back is what the franchise needed: going too far was a huge risk. So, instead, they eliminated the damage of a third sequel. The remaining characters are well adapted to the other reality and donkey always remains the best. The villain, the focus of the film, has a very good characterization and his plan is very well done. On one issue, however, I can agree: it is less parody and more serious. But that's exactly what the franchise needed as an ending (for now). With the fourth film, the franchise doesn't lose the whammy, it stays fresh thanks to the beautiful animations, great development of Shrek and a good story. An underrated masterpiece.",Shrek Forever After,Shrek Forever After - Movie Reviews

Honestly the idea of bringing the characters who have been on an adventure for the past two films ending up in a circus feels mediocre. The film once again keeps the same flaws with the poor pacing, the lack of character development, the hit-or-miss jokes thrown out of nowhere, and the message it tries to tell. However the movie does have more charm and better animation quality. There is one scene that nearly blew me way visually at the circus when Alex, Marty, Gloria, Melman, and the rest have their final performance.

Gold waiting to be found, but their accents were distractingly below par, especially in McDormand's case. Sacha Baron Cohen as a lemur having a whirlwind romance with a bear voiced by Frank Welker of Scooby-Doo fame might have looked good on paper, but reeked of unoriginality and never once provoked so much as a smile.

3965,"Jul 22, 2020","I only have vague memories of watching the first Madagascar movie with some friends and their kids. At the time I thought it was kind of cute, but mostly forgettable. I certainly didn’t think it was going to spawn an entire franchise of films and TV shows, but to my surprise it did. One of the sequels was Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted. And, for the record, I did indeed watch this without seeing the 2nd movie in the franchise. I don’t think much context was needed because this movie is its own insane thing. My distant memories of the first Madagascar film told me that it was all about them wanting to escape captivity to live in the wild. As a result, I found it quite odd that the entire plotline of Madagascar 3 was structured around the heroes wanting to return to their cages. I guess they felt they had a level of fame in the zoo, and they wanted to be loved and adored by humans again. In order to earn their way back to the US they decide to join the circus. There they meet some new friends that love them and accept them as part of the act. From that point on, I’m sure you can write the rest of the plot for them. It’s not an original story, and I found it rather boring. There’s been a trend in many animated films lately to include fast-paced insanity instead of story or actual comedy. This annoys me tremendously, and gets me cringing rather than laughing. Madagascar 3 is a poster child for this film-making style. Everything is moving at a mile a minute, and we’re asked to laugh just because it’s weird. I cannot even recall a single joke that worked in the film, and the story was utter nonsense. As one small example of the stupidity of this movie, somehow the animals all make it from Madagascar to Monte Carlo (I guess by swimming there.) Yet they must go through the entire plot of joining the circus, and working to make it successful enough to tour in New York, in order to make it back home. I understand the real goal of the film-makers was to get the animals in a new and interesting situation, but they couldn’t even invent a decent way of getting them there. I was so detached and disinterested throughout this entire film, despite the fact that it has some decent voice talent. Sadly, they were all performing their voices in an exaggerated fashion, so it was rather obnoxious. There were times when I was actively trying to ignore Madagascar 3, so that I wouldn’t be annoyed by its frenetic idiocy. Maybe this stuff works for kids, but for me it was tedious, to say the least.",SHOW MORE,Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted,Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted - Movie Reviews

From the amazing cinematography to the Oscar-worthy Score, this movie is one of the best to come out this year. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is one of the most mesmerizing performances I've ever seen on screen, the way he depicts his character is not realistic, but also deeply dark and disturbing to viewers. This man is able to creep out and disturb the audience just by laughing. No music or special effects needed. The plot, though flawed and at times unrealistic, is very, very dark and disturbing.

3988,Jacob B,"Aug 10, 2021","Hell to Pay has its problems such as Harley Quinn feeling pointlessly shoehorned in, an excessive cast of characters despite the short runtime and a somewhat convoluted explanation behind an otherwise really good plot twist but the Suicide Squad's third film outing following Assault on Arkham and the 2016 film is still tons of fun. Not to the same level as the kickass James Gunn film I saw two weeks ago but it's another good showing of why DC continues to remain virtually unchallenged when it comes to the direct-to-DVD market. The voice acting is great as always, the action sequences are thrilling, the plot, while generic, fits Task Force X better than the generic doomsday villain of the live-action film, there are good dynamics between some of the characters, the quips put a smile on my face and last but not least, the movie actually tries its damnedest to justify its R-rating unlike The Killing Joke and Justice League Dark, which were honestly less violent than the crazy stuff shown to us in Flashpoint Paradox. Thank God I'm not squeamish to these kinds of things, otherwise I'd have come out of cinema showing of the equally bloody, if not gorier, 2021 film a gibbering, nervous wreck. While slightly inferior to Assault on Arkham, Hell to Pay still succeeds in doing what the 2016 film failed to do, give the Suicide Squad the film adaptation they truly deserve that truly embraces its source material's ""no-punches-pulled"" nature.",Suicide Squad,Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay - Movie Reviews
3989,Puroo R,"Jun 09, 2021","Before I begin to review this movie I would like to take a moment to tell how much I lived under a rock when it came to superhero stuff. So as a kid I never liked superhero cartoons. I always found them over the top. So I had no idea whatsoever about superhero stuff. I thought Batman is just like Superman except he wears a mask, Superman is weak af because I always used to see him get beaten up every time I skimmed through the cartoon channels and saw a glimpse of Justice League or Superman. And the best part - I didn't even know what DC was. I used to think all the superheroes are made by Marvel. So when Suicide Squad was announced in 2016, our teacher had asked us which movie we want to watch. I had said Rustom (a Bollywood film) while the rest of the class said Suicide Squad. I had seen posters of Suicide Squad and I used to think it's just some mindless action film like all zombie movies. So my friend told me it's gonna have Joker in it. I combines two and two together and understood that Suicide Squad is a DC movie. And no, my stoogeness is still not over (wait for it): I was now excited for the movie, because I thought Joker will be played by Heath Ledger! So of course, then we know what all happened. The movie was bad, everyone lost hopes from DCEU, yada yada. But anyway, why I brought this story up is because my very first introduction to Suicide Squad was by the 2016 movie, and that's surely not a good way to be introduced. Sure I understood the concepts, but I had no respect left for the franchise. It's like learning about Green Lantern or Fantastic Four from their movies (...okay, I'll admit. That's how I learnt about them too). So now that I was watching DCAMU, I was a little nervous from watching this movie. But then I thought, let's just go with it. What's the worst that can happen? And surprisingly this is way better than the trashy movie. Now don't get me wrong. I'm all in for the Ayer Cut, provided it fixes that movie. But now I have already been introduced to Suicide Squad the wrong way and nothing can fix that. This is much better. Finally this was the movie that brought the Flashpoint Paradox back to relevance with the rest of the DCAMU movies, which was otherwise never talked about again. The whole Ticket to Heaven storyline was awesome. Everyone was dying at some point, so it was very thrilling to root for any one character. Although I had a hunch that Harley Quinn and Deadshot will never die since they didn't die in the movie either, yet I was really tensed for them. This is in spite of the fact that I don't like either of the two characters. But seeing them all travel in a bus and interact with each other for the first time was very nice to see. The animation, fight scenes (especially Zoom cutting down Bronze Tiger in the end), everything was so awesome. It's nice to see how much DC can do if WB does not keep meddling it. If this movie didn't exist, or rather should I say, if I had not decided to become interested in superhero stuff and not just looked at what the normies are looking at, I'd have continued to hate Suicide Squad. The Suicide Squad, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, the possible Ayer Cut - I'd have hated them all and not even bothered to see them. Thanks to this movie I have become a lot more accepting towards this franchise and can now watch it without the fear of getting bored.",Suicide Squad,Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay - Movie Reviews

""Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay"" seems to suffer that same fate but in a way that still leaves the film entertaining. On the negative side, the film has some really awkward character animation and some really horrible 3-D animation. On the positive side, however, the story is great and does a killer job of connecting itself to one of DC's best animated films, the voice acting is fantastic, and the action and content is able to be exciting and dark without it feeling like it is being gratuitous in nature. Basically, it is one of those rare occasions where DC manages to deliver an R-rated feature that doesn't feel like the goal was to get an R-rating but rather tell a great story that just so happens to get an R-rating.

The Suicide Squad team is pretty good for the most part. And the hard R rating helped out as well. My favorite part of the entire movie is Reverse Flash. I loved him in this movie. But he was so much weaker, but for a good reason. I won't spoil why. But I'm glad it shows he would've beat everyone if he was at his full strength. And even in his weak point, he still was stronger and better than anyone else. But other than him the movie is pretty meh and boring at times. The team keeps you entertained with their banter and jokes at least. Deadshot is also pretty good. This movie way better than the movie version of Suicide Squad that the DCEU had.

4052,Jean L,"Jun 30, 2021","X men days of future past is easily one of the best x men movies of all time and marked the return of Bryan Singer to the franchise after several disappointment entries after his departure. This film is solid and probably underrated featuring great direction, a great story and a large cast that unites the original x men trilogy cast of Patrick Stewart, Ian Mckellen, Hugh Jackman, Halley Berry with the prequel cast of James Mccavoy. Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, and Nicholas Hault. All the performances are great notably a delightfully funny and witty small appearance by Evan Peters as Quicksilver, James McAvoys tortured performance as young xavier, and Michael Fassbenders almost superior interpretation of a young magneto rivaling the charismatic Mcckellen. The movie sends Jackmans wolverine back to the past to meet with young xavier played Mccavoy to stop a future apocalypse. This movie is fun as it brillianly goes back to the past and present weaving between the two separate casts and trilogies in an epic way. Jackman is great with the prequel cast serving as the bridge between the two franchises. The movie has its weaknesses as the story can be devoid of logic and a lot of plot holes created by previous entries. Yet it features great drama, and lots of action that turn this movie into a superhero epic. Easily one of the best in the franchise.",X-Men: Days of Future Past,X-Men: Days of Future Past - Movie Reviews

No setting up characters, just expositon done right and the best part of the movie is definitely the story and pacing. It's awesome seeing the older and newer X-Men cast and it's such an engaging story (and it's a time travel movie) with perfectly clear high stakes. You're always on the edge of your seat, wondering what'll happen, making the movie unpredictable and it's perfectly paced. No scene is too short or fast. The acting, visuals and action are absolutely marvelous with so many cool mutant powers. It's really compelling as well seeing a broken Charles with a great character arc, a Logan who steps into the role of mentor, an awesome Quicksilver scene and it once again explores the relationship with human and mutants and time so well and that 3rd act is phenomenal. I always wonder how it's going to end.

4059,Puroo R,"Apr 15, 2021","I'm gonna be a little too honest here: I bingewatched all the X-Men movies, so I often forget about this movie. Many times I get confused when someone mentions a scene from this movie, and I'm like, ""wait, it happened in THIS movie? I thought it happened in First Class/Apocalypse!"" And I'd prefer admitting that it's my fault than it being the movie's fault. X-Men: Days of the Future Past is what I'd call the movie that bridges X-Men: First Class with the other canonical movies, and at the same time also helps in eliminating the bad movies like The Last Stand and Origins. The movie begins with, as usual, mutants being attacked and eliminated. So to save all of them, Wolverine goes back in time and stop Mystique from killing Bolivar Trask, a defence contractor. Wolverine reached the 1970s, when he was still a mutant without vibranium. And to set planes in motion, he has to find Charlex Xavier, Magneto, Beast and Mystique. Bolivar Trask used Mystique's powers to create Mutant Hunting Robots. In the beginning they were only meant to be used to fight in the Vietnam war, but seeing how Mystique and Magneto revealed themselves, they decided to use the robots to hunt down the mutants itself. They didn't see whether mutants are also sentient beings or not, they just wanted to have them eliminated. And that's when the roles of money and power play. It was on the order of President Nixon that Bolivar decided to make those robots, which President Nixon had ordered only because of Bolivar's influence. So in a way it was a loop of blame. And when Professor X, Wolverine and Quicksilver reach Magneto to save him, we finally get to see the fabled Quicksilver scene, where he takes down all the prison guards single handedly. It was the most iconic moment from the movie, and no amount of appreciation can praise it as much as it deserves. The modern day scenes were also adding to the tension, and in the end when Mystique is left with the choice whether to kill Bolivar or not, it is a quite tense moment whether the mutants in the modern time will survive or not. In the end we see that all the mutants who had died in the previous movies had also come back to life, and the franchise was brought back to where Bryan Singer had left it in X2. Normally it is very difficult to reboot a franchise (read Sonic 06). Not only do you have to understant the major events that need to ve removed in order to fix the franchise, you also have to make the reboot-turning movie really good, otherwise it will just contribute to being the hot garbage that the other movies of the franchise are. And that's the reason why I believe this movie is underrated. It single handedly fixed a failing franchise, joined the acclaimed prequel into the main timeline and became a success both critically and financiallly. It deserves to be one of the most iconic X-Men movies.",X-Men: Days of Future Past,X-Men: Days of Future Past - Movie Reviews

Well-told with a strong good-vs-evil theme appropriate for children (no blurring of the lines here) and morality lessons about bravery, selfishness vs selflessness, caution with strangers, etc aplenty. Some have argued some of the acting was subpar but it wasn't a big deal to me. The music is appropriately majestic and the action retains your interest throughout.

4069,Dale R,"Nov 14, 2021","Four children from London escape the bombardment during WWII to the home of the Professor. While there, they discover the wondrous world of Narnia inside a wardrobe. The children actors do an excellent job in the lead roles, especially Georgie Henly who played Lucy. Tilda Swinton, James McAvoy and the voice of Liam Neeson are also standouts. This is truly a wonderful adaptation of the book. The special effects are hit and miss, you can tell several heads are giant practical effect masks, some green screen scenes are obvious and some of the character animation is off. But the hits are spot on! Aslan's eyes are beautifully animated as is the rest of him and the Beavers as well.

4070,Thomas R,"Sep 18, 2021","C. S. Lewis was the author of the Narnia story series, which was meant to be a ""Lord Of The Rings""-type scenario for children. Lewis himself wrote about religion and was a convert to Christianity later in life, but the Narnia series was not necessarily intended to be an allegory about Christianity, contrary to popular myth. Degrading death and rebirth of someone is obviously not exclusive to the Bible. I mention this because the novels (which I haven't read) and the movie are simply epic adventure stories. So how are they on their own merits? The establishing parts are good; siblings living in London during the Blitz are sent to safety in the countryside, and while playing they discover the title magical kingdom. Unfortunately the children don't really engage us, nor does anyone else, and the story is rather confusing. Worst of all is the ending, where the kids have grown into adults during their time there, but when they get back to their home, they are kids again. Huh? Special effects are okay, but that was about it. Go see Peter Jackson's ""Lord Of The Rings"" instead.","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe - Movie Reviews"

4085,Saad Aman S,"Feb 27, 2021","Book adaptations tend to belong to four categories - the highly flawed commercial successes which the real fans of the book hate with intense passion (Percy Jackson, I'm looking at you), the critical and financial flops (A Wrinkle in Time, Artemis Fowl), films that have a separate passionate fanbase from the book and tend to lean towards the successful kind (Harry Potter is one good example, Winnie the Pooh) and finally - the guys who get picked up, shelved around, are always ""in development"" and never see the day of light. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe was neither. It wasn't a Harry Potter, and it wasn't a critical mess. It also was produced, and merited itself even more films. And after doing all this, it stays true to the adaptation. Fair enough, Christian parents would be a little disappointed seeing their favorite theologian novelist's book getting adapted into what is more of a pure light fantasy and less of a biblical allegory. Although Arsalan is still revered in a similar fashion, the overall aesthetic is far more Lord of the Rings than it is The book of John. It is cinematically well-done, from the bombing of London, the cigar-smoking landlord to the insides of the land of Narnia. The characters do tend to be forgettable though. Not from a depth of good acting or that they aren't fleshed enough - they are fleshed way too much. The White Witch is of course my favorite (from a narrative standpoint and not moral or personal whatsoever) when it comes to the main characters, and Arsalan does a pretty decent job too. It has several heart-warming moments to watch and utter ""Aww"" to, but the only thing it lacks are more LOL moments. Overall, a 3/5 and would say it is pretty fresh.","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe - Movie Reviews"

4089,Nurzhamal K,"Dec 08, 2020","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe This magical fantasy, released in 2005, is a gorgeous screen version of Clive Lewis's novel The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The film directed by Andrew Adamson turned out to be really beautiful, full of magic, breathe-taking story and interesting characters. Due to expensive and high-quality special effects, the film ended up with a big budget of about $ 180 million. When I first saw this film ten years ago, I was completely captured by this story, and loved it forever. Four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, are sent by their parents from London to the village to an old professor - a friend of the family. Once, playing hide and seek, the young heroine Lucy discovers a mysterious wardrobe, thanks to which all four find themselves in the fabulous country of Narnia, where fantastic people, animals and creatures live. It turns out that this peaceful country is under the rule of the evil Witch, because of which it is always cold and eternal winter. Children must help King Aslan, the Great Lion, who founded Narnia many centuries ago, defeat the Witch, break the spell and free the inhabitants of Narnia. I wanted to pay attention to the visual effects, special effects, make-up, scenery, the whole atmosphere in the film - everything was done just perfectly. Watching this fantasy, as if you really find yourself in the magical world of Narnia, in which you want to stay forever. To summarize, I want to say that the film is thought-provoking, spectacular and well-filmed.","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe - Movie Reviews"

There's a great battle scene in there, some fun characters and strong effects. It's a tad too long, but not by much. It has a nice charm to it also, as they set up Narnia excellently. The quartet of children are very well cast, all four of them suit their roles to a T. Georgie Henley is sweet as Lucy, while William Moseley and Anna Popplewell fulfil the roles of Peter and Susan comfortably. Edmund, meanwhile, is of course annoying, but Skandar Keynes does a good job portraying him. Elsewhere, Tilda Swinton and Liam Neeson are terrific casts as the White Witch and Aslan. Both do great, especially Swinton. James McAvoy, Ray Winstone, Michael Madsen and Rupert Everett are smart choices too. I've, as far as I'm aware, never seen the two sequels so very much look forward to seeing what they have in store for me.

4095,Alef M,"Jul 26, 2020","Um bom entretenimento. O obra ,como um todo, faz um bom trabalho no que se diz respeito a caracterização. Mesmo esperando mais do reino - artisticamente, ainda sim temos alguns cenários bonitos, uma trilha sonora excelente, uma cinematografia de gênero, junto ao figurino e as criaturas. O filme não se leva muito a serio, devido ao foco no publico mais infantil. Os personagens não são muito bem desenvolvidos. Edmund tinha uma grande potencial, podendo ser bem complexo. Assim como Pedro - que inclusive, fica mais sem graça ainda com a atuação de William Moseley. Não conheço a obra literária, mas acho difícil que esses personagem sejam tão fracos lá - numa medida de comparação. A vilão não é tem um impacto tão forte quanto deveria, mas Tilda Swinton dá alma a personagem. A voz de Aslam, Liam Neeson, acrescenta um peso absurdo. Sabedoria, um certo tipo de aptidão paciente, força; É, de fato, um ótimo trabalho de dublagem. James McAvoy faz bem o seu trabalho. Mesmo não tendo muito espaço, ele estava irreconhecível. Mesmo com alguns furos, uma vilão que só servia de antagonismo, e protagonistas relativamente fracos, a obra é divertida e passa o tempo. Senti falta de uma lição ao publico infantil, mas isso já é minha preferencia de proposito.","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe - Movie Reviews"

I love how Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy all work together when in danger they always keep each other safe, and they always support each other. Peter saves Susan and Lucy from the wolf. Also, in the battle, Edmund saves centaurs, fauns, and animals by sacrificing himself and destroying the witch's wand. I also like Lucy. She is a good character because she's kind and forgiving and always wants to help people. She forgave Mr. Tumnus. The parts that aren't in the movie makes me sad because I was really looking forward to seeing some of those scenes, like when they were playing with Aslan in a big ball of love and joy.","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe - Movie Reviews"
4098,Finn H,"Jun 24, 2020","MOVIE The movie The Lion,The Witch, And The Wardrobe is disappointing. The worst part is that the creators took all the joy out of it and replaced it all with wars and battles. In the book The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe, you don't actually see the battle. Instead you see joy and happiness, but the movie focuses on violence and war. The courtyard scene with giant Rumblebuffin and the lion who said ""He said us lions"" is missing. So is the scene when the children, who were now adults, talked strangely, for example when Peter said, ""For in all my days I have never hunted a nobler quarry."" Instead they speak very casually. I do not like how the creators changed so much of the book. It ruined the whole movie this way.","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe - Movie Reviews"
4099,Arthur M,"Jun 20, 2020","It is one of the rare cases in which it makes no difference to read the book first or see the film first. Both make the other better, and as an adaptation, the Disney movie is simply flawless. Each line of each scene in the book was accurately transcribed on the screen, also accurately transcribing the emotions and sensations of each moment in the way that C.S.Lewis endeavored to do. But besides being an extremely faithful adaptation to the original, this film also has its universe expanded in a coherent and aggrandizing way to the story it is telling, with several original scenes being created for the script. Scenes that add context, deepen the characters, make what is epic more epic, what is magical more magical and what is deep deeper. It is no exaggeration to conclude that this film is probably the best adaptation of a book ever made.","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe - Movie Reviews"

4108,Dale R,"Nov 15, 2021","This prequel to Monsters, Inc., tells the story of how Mike and Sully met in college. The biggest draw for the first film was the relationship between Sully and Boo, and while Mike and Sully's relationship was interesting, not continuing to develop Sully and Boo was a disappointment. The choice to make a college fraternity movie out of this franchise is interesting on the same level as making a spy movie out of the Cars franchise. There are also several plot points that do not mesh well with the set up from the first movie. On its own, this movie has some great comedic and emotional moments. The voice acting is great and the animation is amazing as always from Pixar. There is a scene during the third act that shows Mike and Sully sitting in front of a Moon lit lake and it is absolutely beautiful!

La animación sigue siendo muy buena. Lo único que no me gustó fue que decidieran hacer una precuela antes que una secuela en la que me hubiese gustado seguir viendo al personaje de Boo ya que era la esencia de la película junto con Mike y Sulley.

4121,Jacob R,"Jun 27, 2021","Ok so….this movie has some great moments. Is that enough to call this a great movie? I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no. This movie has two things that I think are truly great, being the theme and the ending. The theme of the natural (Sully) vs the hard worker (Mike) I think is great. They should use that in more of their movies, I wouldn't mind seeing that again. The ending also portrays to this theme, showing how Mike still found his passion in scaring by coaching other monsters. If only the rest of the movie was like that. First, the animation and voice acting is still stellar. The story and everything that has to do with them being in college is boring and predictable. It's just 80s college movie stereotypes, and I don't want to see that in a Pixar movie, I'm sorry, I just don't. Also the jocks vs the nerds stereotype with the scare games is another thing I just don't want to see in a Pixar movie, again, I just don't want to see that….AT ALL. That made this movie from a good and entertaining one, to barely serviceable. This is just another Brave to me. Just like that movie, I would only watch this movie if you want to say you've seen them all. If not, I'm sad to say, this is another one I would skip. To be honest, this feels like an appetizer before the next big Pixar flick.",Monsters University,Monsters University - Movie Reviews

However the ending of this movie is actually really good and mostly the best part of the movie, but overall the movie could've been better. 7/10",Monsters University,Monsters University - Movie Reviews
4123,Puroo R,"Jun 16, 2021","I never got to know this movie existed. I used to live under a rock back when it released. So the moment I learnt that Monsters Inc has a prequel, I immediately watched it with my sister. We didn't know what we were going to witness other than the fact that the title itself says it's from the time Mike and Sully were in college. And it really stood on our expectations. It's funny, adventurous and has the character development that we want to see in a Pixar movie prequel. This time around Mike is the protagonist. His life is shown from the school days to studying in college and then finally getting a job at Monsters Inc. Seeing him really reminded me of my own days of school, which is the reason why I liked his character so much over here. Sully is like one of those normie guys whom I'd always choose to stay away from in my school/college days. I absolutely hate people like him. And that's what made me side by Mike even more. But eventually as Mike and Sully became friends and took part in the competition, I began liking Sully slowly. He's the kind of a character who may act like a douche, but is not completely bad. He does not behave that way because he himself wants to. He's just doing it because he thinks this is what will make him popular. Coming from a big family he never understood the way normal people behave. And once he became friends with Mike, he slowly began to change. Although he still didn't trust Mike, because of which he cheated to make Mike win by adjusting the dial of the scared child. The ending was actually pretty unexpected. I was thinking they will graduate from college and then become employees at Monsters Inc. After all, the college name sounded just like the company. But the ending seemed completely random and hilarious. They slowly rose up to the ranks, answering the question within the last 30 seconds. I watched this movie about 2 years ago and I have very little memory of it. So I can't exactly remember every single detail that happened in it. I can definitely say that this was a very fun movie, although not exactly memorable. I'd say Monsters University is a good movie, just like all the other Pixar sequels, if you're a fan of the previous movies and want to watch something fun for the whole family. It's quite surprising no one takes its name when talking about Pixar sequels. They only say Cars 2, Finding Dory, Incredibles 2 etc. I wouldn't have even known about it if I didn't open the Pixar Wikipedia page and scrolled through all the names of the movies that I wanted to bingewatch. This movie is definitely something I'd watch again if I get the chance.",Monsters University,Monsters University - Movie Reviews

The new characters were decent, but the story itself didn't feel very original. Voice acting and atmosphere was average. However, the music was nice. The movie starts becoming more focused in the latter stages of the ‘Scare Games' when stakes feel higher and this is where characters begin to develop their one-dimensional personalities. Also, seeing a more realistic art style in the landscape when Mike and Sully visit the human world was unique. I liked the idea of the B-movie cabin in the woods horror scene to scare adults. It gave the movie a fresh change. I didn't find the underlying tones, mood, or humour that you'd expect in a Pixar film, and there was little that would appeal to adult viewers.",Monsters University,Monsters University - Movie Reviews

4134,Italian G,"Mar 12, 2021","This review contains spoilers. Monsters University exists. Luckily it exists. Let's clarify immediately that I loved this film to madness. I really like the US collegiate environment and I really enjoyed seeing Monsters Inc's monster world again. So why didn't I give it 5 stars? Because unfortunately the film has flaws, but there are also great merits. First of all, the animation is of great quality and the amount of monsters created is impressive. The moral of the film is the thing that needs to be given more credit. We have always been used to messages like: always follow your dreams, do not be discouraged by difficulties, become someone. And then comes Monsters University which teaches you that we have impassable limits and that we shouldn't believe too much in dreams. Only this, for me, should be shown to all children: it is a really important message. The film is divided into 3 acts: Mike's arrival at university, the scare games and at the end the surprise with the two protagonists who face the human world for Mike's aversion to the fact that he doesn't scare anyone. All three acts are well done. Honestly my favorite is not the third act, as everyone thinks, but the second: all the games are great and Johnny Worthington III, the second act villain, I love it. But let's go now to the painful notes of the film. The film already contradicts itself in its existence: in Monsters Inc Mike says that they met well before university. But here it is necessary to specify how they knew about the sentence and tried to create a link anyway, which however was too forced. So I can perfectly understand why they didn't. The new characters added, except Dean, are poorly characterized and are not given much space. Most of all I would have liked to know more about Johnny's past and why he bullies Mike. Moreover, even the members of the ozma kappa themselves do not have three-dimensionality. Randall, however, forms the lowest point in the characters. I love Randall at Monsters Inc, but they made some serious mistakes here developing him. He is presented to us as kind, shy, however the opposite of how we all know him. So during the vision I wondered how they were going to change his temperament. Well, he becomes a popular monster thanks to Mike and therefore has access to the ROR group (Johnny's fraternity so to speak). So, during the games, I honestly didn't see any gradual changes, but it seems like suddenly, during the final game, Randall totally changed his character. Don't tell me that failing to scare Sulley's retaliation is justifiable. An early-film Randall wouldn't have taken it so badly. If you wanted to radically change Randall, maybe I would have put the background on ROR or I would have already shown a different character at the beginning of the film. Because in my opinion the influence of the RORs is no excuse. The relationship between Mike and Sulley is really well developed, even too much. Perhaps the real problem with the film is precisely that: they thought too much about Mike and Sulley leaving out the other characters. That said, the film, despite its flaws, managed to do the most important thing, which is to make you fall in love with the characters and the film in general. A student plot, Pixar-branded animations but above all a morality worthy of the study make Monsters University a very good film despite the superficiality of the non-main characters.",Monsters University,Monsters University - Movie Reviews

The CGI is also improved upon in this, as is the world-building with the introduction of the teased city Zion. However, where this film falls short in comparison to the first is the story, which feels more predictable and bland than the original.

I thought it would be a disaster but honestly, it was correct without being absolutely fantastic like the first one. I think that the story wasn't good and that is why it wasn't really good. Too much useless moments and it is long for nothing. Honestly, it could have been 1h45 and it would have been better. Also, I think Neo has too much power. I mean, he can be the One without being a mix of Superman, Spider-man, Batman and Black Panther. He revives Trinity, ok. He flies, ok... He fights thousands of Agent Smith, well that is a bit too much. Also, I think the VFX are worst than in the first movie. Some moments were animated like in the Polar express and I didn't like it. I know it was impossible to do it differently but that made me under appreciate the visuals. Now, I really liked the script. It was richer than in the first one. Keanu doesn't just ask questions and there is some really nice lines. Especially from Morpheus. More sci-fi and thought-provoking talks and I like it. To finish, like in the first one, I just love the unrealistic fights because they are so insane, bizarre and nice. I also enjoyed hearing that fantastic voice of Agent Smith.

No. There's some great worldbuilding like the addition of Zion. I love the design and it's awesome seeing the free human city mentioned in the first movie and it was also great seeing the people freed from the Matrix and what they suffered through including some of the politics. The action and choreography of this movie is outstanding with the freeway chase being the standout and while some of the CGI is poor, the effects are incredibly impressive for the most part, the acting is great just like the first movie, more philosophical reasons are discovered like the concept of human choice, cause and effect as well as this idea of reason and these philosophical conversations are interesting especially with the Oracle and Merovignian. The Keymaker is another interesting bit of worldbuilding and I like Trinity and Neo's relationship and seeing their love for one another and we also learned of the origins of the Matrix and contrary to popular belief, I liked the inclusion of the Architect, subverting the story from the supposed chosen one trope that was so insisted by Morpheus. All in all, it's a good sequel. It's really flawed though. There's this dance party in Zion with a ton of overly sexualized characters that's dragged on too long, the plot takes a while to get going and the fact that the movie was split into two did not help. The movie tries to do too much with its ambition and this has the whole Zion plotline as well as the machines invading it sadly forgotten most of the movie and some of the action and philosophical conversations are too long, ruining the pacing. The movie feels kind of tensionless with the lack of threat. The way Neo revives Trinity and discovers his new found power makes no sense . Neo is also so overpowered in this movie now and Agent Smith is brought back somehow and does nothing. The ending is quite unsatisfying, being rushed but frankly, this movie doesn't deserve some of the hate it gets. The first Matrix is way better but this is a good sequel that, while very flawed, has a lot of the great stuff that made the original a masterpiece.",The Matrix Reloaded,The Matrix Reloaded - Movie Reviews
4160,Taekwondo Life M,"Sep 10, 2021","This is good but not as a stand alone. I think the love of the first film and the interest in the characters and story carries most of this film. While it is a continuation of the original and seems to pick up where the original left off, it seems off point fo the importance message and mission that ended the second. We do see an expansion off the rebellion and are exposed to more members of the Resistance; however, that is not necessarily a good thing. There is more disharmony than I expected among and between these characters in light of the heroics of the original. Fishburne, Moss, and Reeves are great. Some new characters are very intriguing. Others not so much. While there is more of Agent Smith in some ways- he is much less interesting in others. The fight scenes and visuals are still stellar. The visual effects are spectacular. The music is compelling. This film does not hold up to the first- but no film really could. The real question I keep asking myself is whether this film should have been made at all. Regardless, Neo is one part Anakin Skywalker, one part Paul Atredes, and 100% one of the coolest characters in modern movies.",The Matrix Reloaded,The Matrix Reloaded - Movie Reviews
4161,Jordan E,"Sep 09, 2021","I just rewatched all three of these movies yesterday so now is the perfect time for me to review them. The Matrix Reloaded isn't a bad film at all, it's nowhere near as good as the first movie but there is still a lot about this film that makes it interesting and worth watching. I do have my fair share of complaints about Reloaded but I'll get to those at the end of my review, I'm going to explain what I like so much about this film first. For starters, The Wachowskis took the already visually stunning, intense and masterfully coreographed fight sequences from the first movie and turned everything about them up to 11 for Reloaded. The freeway chase sequence in my opinion is still one of the most suspenseful and intense action sequences in all of modern film, and the fight sequence between Neo & Agent Smith in the park after Neo's conversation with The Oracle is just straight up awesome. Before I first watched this movie as a kid I never thought I would find something like Keanu Reeves fighting a literal moshpit of Hugo Weavings so mindnumbingly entertaining. Sure, a lot of the CGI in that fight scene is kinda cheesy and dated looking rewatching it now almost 20 years after it came out, but I feel like critics who allow stuff like that to take points off of movies as a whole are way too nitpicky. I also really like the introduction to the last human city of Zion in this movie, it has a perfect dystopian feel to it. I also love the way we get to see Neo's powers evolve throughout the film, it has a very special way of slowly showing that Neo is growing to become the most powerful being in all of The Matrix. The sequence at the end of the movie where Neo's visions about Trinity dying come true and he uses his new powers to literally digitize his arm reach inside her body to jumpstart her heart and bring her back to life is really cool. But that is where my affections toward The Matrix Reloaded end and my many problems with this movie begin. First of all and this is my biggest problem with not only this entire movie but also all of The Matrix Revolutions is that it doesn't feel like Neo's story anymore. Reloaded & Revolutions seemed to entirely forget that Neo is supposed to be the main protagonist of these movies, instead he spends pretty much the entirety of both sequels feeling more like a melodramatic side character while the movies shifted all of their focus on Morpheus, Niobe, Commander Lock, and the crews of The Hammer, The Logos and The Nebuchadnezzar. This movie is pretty much all about stupid senseless arguing between Commander Lock, who might I add is one of the most idiotic and hateable characters of this entire franchise and Morpheus. The entire ""build-up"" to the war in the mediocre excuse for a third film could have been and SHOULD have been a small side-plot. Not the main focus of basically the entire movie. Also, I hate The Architect. That entire sequence needs to be removed from the movie completely. It ruins the mystery of The Matrix by literally showing you who created it. One of the best parts of the first movie was that nobody truly knew where The Matrix came from or how it was operated, by introducing The Architect in his stupid room made of TV screens the directors were literally taking 60% of what makes these movies so cool and shooting it in the face at point blank range. In my review of the first movie I mentioned how much I like the philosophical feeling that presents itself throughout the whole plot. In Reloaded that sense of philosophy is completely gone and instead everybody basically just speaks in riddles for 2 hours & 18 minutes, the worst offenders of this complaint being THE FRENCHMAN, Agent Smith and The Architect. My last problem with this movie overall is Neo & Trinity's romantic relationship. The Wachowskis couldn't write convincing love if someone held a gun to their heads. Whenever these two are on screen together they just make out like high schoolers and throw sappy Valentine's Day card level compliments at eachother and we're expected to believe they have his strong loving relationship just because the movie tells us to think that. AND DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THAT AWKWARD 5 MINUTE LONG SEX SCENE. Also, The Keymaker was completely pointless to the plot besides to guide Neo to The Architect, which is one of the worst plot twists in film history. Anyways, for the most part this movie is entertaining to watch for the action sequences and scenes that actually involve Neo. Other than that, this movie feels more like a spinoff than an actual sequel to the first Matrix movie. 7 out of 10.",The Matrix Reloaded,The Matrix Reloaded - Movie Reviews
4162,Christian K,"Sep 07, 2021","With the trailer for The Matrix Resurrections hitting Comic Con recently (although still widely unavailable for the rest of us) I had an urge to rewatch the sequels. Since the last time I saw The Matrix both the original directors have come out as trans (Lily and Lana Wachowski) and have since stated that the original film was an allegory about being transgender. It's certainly not a reading I considered at fourteen, I was more sold on the many different types of religious allegories that appeared to be spattered throughout the film. It will be interesting to rewatch now knowing the exact interpretation that the directors intended. Anyway I started with Reloaded. I remember being insanely excited for the film when it came out, and although it's not close in terms of having as many interesting things to say as its predecessor, Reloaded has many aspects to it that still impress. The freeway sequence remains a standout, and Neo's fight with an increasing number of Agent Smith doubles isn't quite as grating as it was the first time round. Critically The Matrix Reloaded was on a hiding to nothing on its release; however good it might have been it wouldn't have been good enough. And although many argue there was no need for these sequels, Reloaded does a much better job of following up The Matrix than it gets credit for. It will be interesting to see how Revolutions holds up; I've always been an apologist for both the sequels despite their backlash from all sides. Perhaps that sort of attitude will lend itself favourably to Resurrections on its release in December this year; I have literally no idea what to expect of it.",The Matrix Reloaded,The Matrix Reloaded - Movie Reviews

Why did Neo become Superman? Where did all the people come from? How do they manage to produce food? How come they weren't found and killed by the machines?

4169,James M,"Aug 13, 2021","The Matrix Rehashed, I mean, Reloaded, was always going to be a tough sell. Our minds were fully bent by the first film, but there was not much left in the Wachowski bag of tricks for any sequels that would allow them to hit the same highs. More Kung fu. Meh. More bullet time. Meh. More Agent Smith (literally). Double meh. In my view, there was a wasted opportunity to do something different with the Smith character, just as Terminator 2 did with the T800 (Schwarzenegger's character). For example, they could have explored the idea that Agent Smith has become an outlaw program, having been freed within the system by Neo, requiring other characters within the Matrix to assist Neo to destroy the exile program. Instead, they chose more of the same, Neo battles multiple copies of Agent Smith, but this time with unrealistic cgi fight scenes, with a muddled plot that doesn't seem to go anywhere. Spoiler alert: Matrix III dishes up even more if the same. Let's hope Matrix iV brings us something genuinely new.",The Matrix Reloaded,The Matrix Reloaded - Movie Reviews

I can't stop gasping when they were fighting or when the racing took place. If the 1st Matrix is awesome to you, this one won't stop disappoint you because it did raise a bar. - It is making the concept more difficult, tbh I still can't grasp the idea of Matrix and get mixed up with reality / matrix. How can you define reality? How do you know if it's real? I agree that the second part does not explore deeper the Matrix and explain to us what it is ( a very slight touch on at the Source scene but it is very metaphorical trust me). BUT COME ON, AT THE END CREDIT THEY TOLD YOU THERE WOULD BE A THIRD PART AND TO ANYONE'S NORMAL THINKING PROCESS, THEY WOULD THINK THAT THE CONCEPT WOULD BE WELL-EXPLAINED IN THE THIRD PART AND THEY WOULD BUY THE TICKET TO WATCH IT IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT. THAT'S CALLED MARKETING DUH? So frustrated when people do not think movies are not for profit or their main focus is just to entertain us.

4180,Jonathan S,"Mar 07, 2021","After the runaway success of The Matrix, the Wachowski sisters had the most creative and financial power of their entire career. It's safe to say the anticipation to The Matrix Reloaded was incredible. It was a cultural phenomenon and constantly the topic of discussion during free time at high school. The sequel sees Neo (Keanu Reeves) and his allies race against time before the machines destroy their city of Zion. While seeking the truth of The Matrix, Neo must face a vengeful Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving). Packed with as much visual flair as the predecessor, I clearly remember my jaw hitting the floor at the thrilling action sequences. They're full of energy, kinetic and wonderful to watch. The fight choreography is incredibly varied, mixing hand-to-hand martial arts with guns, and even car chases. The highway sequence is possibly one of the best set pieces of the past decade. The performances from everyone are just as strong as before. Keanu Reeves (Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure) delivers a somber and cool attitude of Neo. Whereas Hugo Weaving (Mortal Engines) is perfectly cast in a career-defining role as Agent Smith. He knows exactly how to best articulate the dialogue. While The Matrix is definitely a superior movie, The Matrix Reloaded is a worthy follow-up.",The Matrix Reloaded,The Matrix Reloaded - Movie Reviews

4224,Chris J,"Oct 25, 2021","F9: The Fast Saga - PG-13 (2h 23m) 2021 - Action, Adventure, Crime, Thriller 2.5/5 stars So my thoughts are kinda all over on this one. On one hand, this was exactly what the series is supposed to be. Over the top crazy, I mean the franchise inches towards crazier with each installment. I remember way back when, in the first film when they were stealing TV/VCR combos and having fun street racing. Now they're literally going to space in cars... (with little to no explanation about the issues with that idea.) This one did some fun things with returning characters, some of which I guess survived moments that are now pretty lame if you re-watch the older films. The ending was really interesting, I'm crossed because it kinda felt forced but at the same time was a fun was to pay homage to a character that doesn't appear in the film. As a whole, the story of the film was more than predictable but they never have been. The reason I didn't go lower with the rating is similar to how some of the Amityville sequels get higher ratings than most would think. I don't care if you spend $500 or $500 million making a film, if you know what the film is and play into that, then in my book it's a win. I'll continue to check out this franchise because they're a fun brainless popcorn flick and sometimes that's exactly what you need! I wonder how they'll top going to space! #f9 #thefastsaga",F9: The Fast Saga,F9 The Fast Saga - Movie Reviews

Evil geniuses with evil accents, car chases, a watch that has some sort of a magnet in it, a lair, a staggering array of incompetent henchmen, failing to actually kill Bond…. tick, tick, tick, tick tick. Lovely Bond girls presented in a less attainable or more responsible way than Connery would recognise. Great backdrops, martinis, Aston Martin V8, the Navy, M, Q, other letters, 2*007s; tick, tick, tick. Pheobe Whaller-Bridge clearly worked a bit of magic on the script, adding humour to what would have been a worthy but exhausting affair.

4241,Reba,13h ago,"While I liked Skyfall better I cannot think of a more epic or caring way to close out the Daniel Craig era of Bond than No Time to Die. Craig has brought not just a gritty realism to the Bond but also a humanity that was evident from Casino Royale and only grew as the series progressed. The humanity that was often lacking in period iterations of Bond were on clear display. If I were to criticize this movie it would be that it may have been better served as a 2 part epic rather than an occasionally rushed, but brilliant piece of action/drama storytelling.

4318,Jacqueline G,"Oct 17, 2020","On August 31, 2019, ""Ne Zha"" made the second largest box-office record of Chinese movies. So you may wonder, what makes ""Ne Zha"" so popular? ""Ne Zha"" which was a new released animated movie last summer based on a chinese legendary mythical figure called ""Nezha"" directed and written by Jiaozi. It is still on trends because of its interesting acting styles and meaningful content. As soon as I saw it, I became a fan of this movie and even watched it twice later. Nezha was chosen to be a reincarnation of a good spirit. However, unfortunately it was replaced with the evilest spirit when he was born. He showed his stubborn and mischievous nature which made the villagers panic. In the process of his growing up, the villagers had always treated him with prejudice and fear, no matter what he thought or did. The prejudice was that monsters in people's hearts can cover their eyes and can't see the truth. Finally, until Nezha tried his best to save the villagers, they really let go of their prejudices and accepted him. The reason why I like it is because it gives us some positive energy about life. Nezha said: ""My destiny isn't written in the stars, but held in my hands."" You know, maybe we all have our own destinies. However, there are still some parts of our lives that can be changed to be good if our minds are set to be so. So who are you, do you have the final say? We are constantly defined by various occasions and needs. Regarding the truth about ourselves, sometimes we have no say in ourselves. Just like the protagonist Meursault in ""The Outsider ""by the existentialist master Camus, he has no right to speak on the truth of the case he is involved in. This world is sometimes so ridiculous, and many of us in it just endure silently. Therefore, the explosive moment of ""Nezha"" must arouse the blood and passion in the hearts of the audience. We need Nezha, even if it's just in the movie. The film retains the essence of Chinese traditional culture, good visual effects; the other is the modernity and sense of humor in character shaping and language style. There is also an ugly side in the film. Compared to the truth, many people are more willing to believe in hearsay and then look at people with colored glasses. Moreover, the writer clearly used ""Ao Bing"" as a contrast to Nezha, highlighting that whether a man or a devil is an independent choice, rather than a subject that is destined by nature. Generally speaking, I take the view that this Chinese animation is of good quality and worth watching. The final product is fascinating and stunning with great humor, deep emotion, exciting action.",Ne Zha,Ne Zha - Movie Reviews

4320,Catalina D,"Sep 25, 2020","The movie of Nezha is set in a Mythical world in China. There is a powerful orb that absorbs all energy, which was meant to be destroyed by Taiyi and Shen, two immortals with great powers. It is known as the Chaos Pearl. The Chaos Pearl is divided into two opposite orbs by Yuan Shi (the primordial lord of heaven) the Spirit Pearl and the Demon Orb. Casting a spell of destruction on the Demon Orb to be destroyed in three years so that it doesn't destroy the world. Yuan Shi gives the order to Taiyi to take the spirit pearl so that it can be born into a human. The spirit pearl was supposed to be born as Nezha however due to Shen switching the orbs a young boy is birthed from the Demon Orb whose demonic nature is apparent. As a young boy, Nezha is loved by his parents who lied to him to tame his demonic nature. He is trained by Taiyi to become a demon hunter and is told that he was born from the Spirit Pearl. Becoming impatient he escapes to hunt demons where he meets Ao Bing (also trained to hunt demons) who was born from the spirit pearl as a dragon and was educated rigorously to become a demon hunter and to beware of humans. They fight together the demon however Ao Bing loses, and Nezha ends up rescuing him. The villagers however misinterpret the situation and blame all the destruction on Nezha due to his demonic nature. Nezha and Ao Bing become friends. However Nezhas's third birthday is coming, his parents throw him a birthday party and force the town to come. Shen visits Nezha before the party and tells him that he has lied to his whole life and that he was born of the demon orb. Nezha feels betrayed and unleashes his demonic powers destroying everything and almost killing his dad however he leaves to await his fate. Shen knows that if Yuan Shi finds out the truth about what had happened. Tat all of the dragon race will be condemned. So Ao bing decides to use his powers to destroy Nezha's village to erase any evidence of the events. Nezha is shown through a vision that his dad had been trying to find a way to remove the curse. In which he takes the curse upon himself so that Nezha could live. Because of this Nezha returns to his village to stop Ao Bing from destroying his village. He defeats Ao bing but spares him. When lighting comes to kill him he surrenders to his fate. However, Ao bing joins him in taking the hit of the lighting. Because of them joining the Chaos Pearl is once again united and can absorb the full hit of the lighting. Taiyi makes it possible for their spirits to survive. This story plays the themes of nature vs. nurture and choice. Even though Nezha was naturally born with a demonic spirit, didn't have many friends, and was feared and hated by his village, he was raised by good parents who loved him, taught him to control himself, and was told that he was born from the spirit pearl. So when Nezha was growing up, he had a pretty positive paradigm about himself, which led him to be able to control his demonic nature and be good. On the other, hand, we see Ao Bing being born from the spirit pearl he was told that he was going to be great, he did however have a rougher upbringing being raised by the king of the dragons and trained by Shen, and like a dragon, he was a hated creature by humans, but he was loved by his kin. When the time comes for them to know, and be faced by who they are. They have the choice to be what their destinies told them to be, or who they were raised to. Having to choose to act upon their natures, what they were told their whole life to be, or choose between good and bad. Nezha decides to act for himself and not let his nature control him, he decides to defend his family, his village, and what is right. What is interesting for me is not Nezha's struggle with choice, but it is Ao Bings. He was way more likely to be good since he was born from the Spirit Pearl, but because of the way he was nurtured to protect his kin he struggles with the choice of helping Nezha save his village or helping Shen. However, in the end, he helps Nezha and also helps Nezha's life as a spirit by uniting their powers. Overall I love this movie because of the character development presented and the message of us choosing to act and not be acted upon. It is also light-hearted and a perfect family night movie. The final rating would be 5 stars!",Ne Zha,Ne Zha - Movie Reviews

4339,Theresa S,"Dec 23, 2019","Nezha is one of the most popular and well-known mythical characters in China. Nezha appear in many myths. There are various versions of Nezha's story, and it has been adapted many times in animation and movies. But this adaptation is revolutionary. In the original myths, Nezha is a good boy, but the plot is way more violent. In the myths, Nezha is human baby borne with divine power. His father is indifferent and strict with him. One day, Hezhan caught the Dragon Prince killing children, and then he killed the Dragon Prince (cruelly skinned the young dragon alive). When Dragon King found out, it came to Nezha's revenge. The Dragon King wanted to flood Nezha's hometown with seawater. To protect the village, Nezha committed suicide in front of the Dragon King and his parents. Later, Nezha was resurrected in the lotus and became a God. Then Nazhe destroyed the dragon palace, caught the Dragon King, and became one of the Gods of War. In other versions, Nezha killed a total of 9 dragons. Comparing to the original myth, this movie is chill and light hearted in a good way. The rebellious character of Nezha is fresh and interesting to watch. This story emphasis on the lesson of ""choosing your own path"", where the original version is more about ""unconditional self-sacrifice"" and ""孝道(obedience towards elder family members)"". The revised story in the film is more in line with modern values than the original myths.",Ne Zha,Ne Zha - Movie Reviews

4349,Dave S,1d ago,"Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity is a roller coaster ride through space, a testament to the resilience of a human being in the face of unimaginable adversity. Sandra Bullock plays Dr Ryan Stone, an astronaut left alone in the vast expanse of space when her colleagues are killed by space debris. The entire film is thrilling, but the first thirty minutes are absolutely remarkable, a crowning achievement in special effects and cinematography. The special effects and cinematography are stellar throughout the film, as are the sound effects and the performance by Bullock.

Also, Bullock won a nomination for her acting? This wasn't deserved in the slightest, mostly grunting, heavy breathing, and terrible one liner cliché comments.

My biggest fear through the film was that Bullocks Botox would zit explode at zero gravity.

The films beautifully constructed shots and editing is actively being detracted from by the absolute disregard of high school level physics, a story that couldn't be less engaging and is the most basic accumulation of stereotypes (US good, Russia bad, China stupid; mentioning deceased family as a tear-jerker; sacrifice of a main character to heighten the stakes....) to try and construct a semblance of relatability for audiences. It is an affront to modern space technology, a premise that should've been outdated even in cold wars films, and a soundtrack that does nothing but horror-style tremolo strings rising in pitch slowly for 90 minutes straight. In general, the only ""thrill"" achieved by the movie to make it actually fit the description of ""Sci-Fi Thriller"" was the soundtrack desperately hammering every single horror staple home to a nauseating degree. Combine this with the unfitting joke-scenes completely subverting any seriousness that might have been left, and what remains is a hot mess of garbage that looks somewhat beautiful.

Clooney's character floating away was absurd. There was no force pulling him away. And yes, I am aware that centripetal force could have pulled him away but there were several shots that show they obviously were not spinning so that's not a valid theory here. They killed off Clooney's character just because they needed some drama. The rest of the movie is just things going wrong over and over and the protagonist finding ways to narrowly overcome it on the way to a predictable ending with some pretty forced emotion.

4379,Hendry L,"Dec 14, 2020","I remember deciding to watch this movie in cinemas because critics were all praising it as one of the best movies of that year. I watched it in IMAX 3D and remember being blown away by the movie. It won: Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, Best Sound Editing, and Best Sound Mixing at the Oscars which is a lot of awards. The synopsis is ""Dr Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a medical engineer on her first shuttle mission. Her commander is veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney), helming his last flight before retirement. Then, during a routine spacewalk by the pair, disaster strikes: The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Ryan and Matt stranded in deep space with no link to Earth and no hope of rescue. As fear turns to panic, they realize that the only way home may be to venture further into space"". I've decided to rewatch it on a whim but this time on my home TV. The question is if this movie is overrated or deserving of its accolades. Let's talk about the concept first, it's great. A survival movie in space, with no monsters or anything like that, is such a great concept that has not been done before or since its release. The movie perfectly illustrates the horror but also the beauty of space in a way that surprisingly meshes well together. On that note of the beauty, the cinematography is amazing. A lot of amazing cinematography is usually using real shots but Gravity does it all through CGI. It shouldn't work as CGI is quite obvious and bad CGI can even take you out of the movie but Gravity doesn't ""fall"" in that category. There are a lot of gorgeous shots that feel like paintings and this is partially thanks to the amazing visual effects. The set design for the space ships are claustrophobic and further emphasise the loneliness within this movie. The score is great and elevates the tension in the scenes where the score is prominent but during the more hopeful scenes, the score is more orchestral and beautiful. The movie doesn't rely on the score too much and sometimes just lets the silence of space or the breathing of the astronauts to suck the audience into the movie and it works. The movie is visually spectacular but what about the characters and story? The movie is revolved around Dr Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) who is our point of view character. For the most part, the movie makes us care about her because of the situation she is in and that is fine. However, the director (Alfonso Cuarón) decided to include a scene that elaborates on Ryan Stone's backstory on Earth. This is a good choice as it makes the audience more sympathetic with her and more understanding of why her personality is what it is or why she does certain actions or choices in the movie. Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney) is a sort of anchor character that support Ryan throughout the movie. He has a contrasting personality to Ryan as he is funny and charismatic yet due to being more experienced is also one who guides Ryan. I like the dynamic between the two of them and when both of them are interacting it's funny or heartwarming. I also have to praise Sandra Bulluck as she does a great job in carrying this movie. Her performance whenever she is struggling in space feels genuine and I can feel the fear and panic just from the tone of her voice. She also delivers in the emotional moments that bring the scene to life. She was deserving of that best actress nomination at the Oscars. George Clooney does a pretty good job as well. Although, he mostly just plays Matt as the witty and charming guy. I do like it when the two are together, George overshadows Sandra which sounds weird but that is exactly what it should be in terms of who their characters are and what the plot is asking. I don't have many flaws with the movie that aren't just nitpicking but I do think the fact that Dr Ryan Stone seems to constantly panic in the first half of the movie kind of weird. Dr Ryan Stone just seems to not know the basics of being in space so know it all Matt Kowalsky constantly has to tell her stuff that I think she should've known. From a movie perspective, I get why this choice was made so that the audience can easily understand things about space but it could've handled way better in my opinion. Additionally, we get some backstory on Dr Ryan Stone but we don't get anything on Matt which I find a bit odd and lessens the impact of a certain scene. Unfortunately, I do think a lot of the impact this movie has is sadly lost because I am not watching it in a cinema. You could argue that with a lot of movies but for me watching this throughout certainly made me think ""this would be way better in a cinema"". In conclusion, I still really enjoyed the movie. Yes, the movie is impressive because of its style but in terms of substance, it certainly is lacking. However, the movie is just so visually spectacular that I don't mind it. Furthermore, a lot of great movies such as ""Dunkirk"" and ""1917"" do similar things to Gravity and they are both great movies as well. Gravity still is one of the best space movies to have come out in the last 20 years. I feel this movie accomplishes a lot with visual effects and space cinematography. A lot of people might not be talking about this movie anymore but for me, I certainly will still remember it.",Gravity,Gravity - Movie Reviews

4414,Ben N,"Aug 27, 2021","Steve Rogers is one of the best characters to come out of MCU. He's paired up with Natasha ""Black Widow"" in this story. I love her fighting style and 'grit' but her character is simply not given enough rope to work with - I guess she needs to remain 'mysterious' until her own movie. As a result their relationship fleshes out in a way I understand but do not ""feel"". By contrast, the Captain America figure is laid bare and we can see the different factions and emotions pulling at his deep seeded loyalty. I like this story as it gives a setting to his moralistic wrangling and, like us all, he just wants to see his choices make a difference and to feel like he has agency over his own life. The Winter Soldier idea is cool - the whole Shield is a shell that has grown the enemy within is not new, but was decently executed. Falcon seems to survive too easily. Does he even have 'superpowers'? He take a ton of punishment if not. The movie is too long - of course, all of these MCU movies are too long for an action flick. But I take at least two sittings to watch anything these days since I'm on my own couch anyway, so no big deal. I knocked off a star due to that length and the fact that very important dialogue to halfway decent plot is spurted out after a gut punch, or growled through gritted teeth, or whispered while explosions go off in the background, or shouted while a crescendo of 'dramatic' music flares too often.",Captain America: The Winter Soldier,Captain America: The Winter Soldier - Movie Reviews

It all starts out with the forest wedding of Bella (Stewart) and Edward (Pattinson). This then turns in to a honeymoon with unanticipated consequences. Just way too much extended scenes and drab dialogue that should have been cut. And the inability of the two leads to barely go through the motions of acting at being in love is galling.

A lot of people and reviewers prepared me for a boring movie in which nothing happens but that's not what I felt from the overall package. Sure, the movie is just as cheesy and ridiculous in its first half and I did find myself rolling my eyes during it. However, once the main plot of the movie kicks in halfway, I thought it was pretty solid. The pace moves much quicker and the focus is taken off of the romance just for a little bit, and the movie is better for it. I am not saying this is a great movie as it still has many technical issues in terms of acting and writing, but I will say it is far better than anything this franchise aside from the first movie.",The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 - Movie Reviews

4450,Jacob B,"Aug 13, 2019","I actually did enjoy the wedding and honeymoon of this movie. I know Edward gets a lot of flak for acting like an emotionally abusive boyfriend and Bella's shown to be just as flawed with or without him and people aren't wrong about that but Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson do share surprisingly good chemistry during this section of the movie. Perhaps it's not all that surprising seeing as how this was from the director of the live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast. Visual effects ain't half-bad either. Then Bella gets pregnant. This is where it all goes downhill for me. We spend the rest of the movie at the Cullens' house once Edward and Bella leave Brazil, with a few scenes that take place in either the woods or Charlie Swan's house and I'll just say that the whole pregnancy conflict honestly doesn't feel all that interesting given that the stakes don't feel particularly high. The action being dialed down to zero compared to the relatively decent asskicking in Eclipse doesn't help one bit. The ""Part 1"" of the title is an incredibly transparent attempt to cash in on the success of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows which were both critically and commercially successful (I personally consider it to be my favourite Harry Potter movie but only if counted as one movie). And I'm sorry, a well-intentioned anti-abortion message just doesn't seem like enough to warrant the adaptation of the final book being a two-parter. Give Deathly Hallows some credit, at least there was some epic and visually stunning wizard-vs-wizard action and I actually do care about those characters and understand how high the stakes were there. And the anti-abortion message would be fine if not for the fact that the concept of imprinting means that Jacob falls in love with a creepy CGI - still better than that animatronic they were initally going to use and fortunately the uncanny valley only comes in affect when we see her up close - baby. Gee, why don't we hear a lot from Taylor Lautner anymore when his character will likely never live that down? Breaking Dawn Part 1 is not a good movie and has its fair share of silly moments, most notably the wolves speaking telepathically when there was no indication that wolves could ever actually do that in earlier installments plus it looking siller than if the VFX artists decided to animate lip movement, but at least Part 2 has an epic battle...though I do know the big twist about it.",The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 - Movie Reviews

4467,Astrid P,"Apr 15, 2017","Twilight Breaking Dawn Part 1 is a movie from the Twilight saga which originally is a serie of 4 books. They made 5 movies out of it. In my opinion it's a quite good fantasy movie but more made for young adults and teenagers. This movie was directed by Bill Condon and released the 18th of november 2011. The 3 main actors are Kristen Stewart ((Isa)Bella Swan) , Robert Pattinson (Edward Cullen) and Taylor Lautner (Jacob Black). In this movie Edward and Bella get married, she unexpectedly got pregnant during their honeymoon. This twist causes a lot of debates and fights between the recently married lovers and between the vampires and werewolves. The baby could cost Bella's life. The actors are believable, their acting skills are better than in the previous movies thus as the screenplay. They respected the books well. The movie is well shot, the camera angles are good : mostly close shot, extreme close up at the right moments (extreme close up on Bella's eyes at the end, the last image of the movie), Upward and Downward shots during the duel between the Alpha wolves, establishing shot during the wedding to show the beauty of the place and all the guests,... The soundtrack is very, very good, it's mostly alternative/ indie rock songs and a piano melody throughout the whole movie. There are percussions adding to the piano melody when actions are happening. The special effects (wolves' transformation) and make up are good too, all the Cullen have a really pale face and pregnant Bella needed to look very sick and skeletal and it is very well done.

4469,Joe M,"Jul 25, 2021","""New Moon"" is a real step down from the mediocre ""Twilight"". The worst aspect of this film - it bludgeon the audience with a Romeo and Juliet undertone and self harm as an antidote to breaking up - not a good message for teens. It has way too heavy an emphasis on the whole tortured separation between Bella (Stewart) and Edward (Pattinson), with Stewart even more wooden than in the first film and Pattinson almost catatonic. The only real plus is the added twist of hunky Jake (Lautner) 'dogging' Bella - who is just shameless in how she leads him on. The near finale in Italy really amped it up but not enough to save the film. Much, much too long - could have easily cut 30 minutes or more.",The Twilight Saga: New Moon,The Twilight Saga: New Moon - Movie Reviews

4480,Cait G,"Dec 29, 2020","New Moon, the second instalment in the Twilight Saga, is probably not for anyone who is not remotely interested in the original story. It is not a standalone film. There is much more action (although balanced out by the extreme inaction of Bella's severe depression of the first third). Chris Weitz definitely made this a more polished and big-budget looking film than the original. Although whether the polish ultimately adds or distracts from the love story is an interesting question, there are some really beautiful scenes (especially the Italian scenes with the Volturi). The actors are not as painfully awkward and have become more comfortable in their characters and with each other and that does make the the entire viewing experience better.

4486,"Sep 09, 2020","When I watched the first Twilight film I felt that it was bland and uninteresting in every way, and one thing I most certainly did not feel was interest in what happens next. It simply doesn’t feel like an ongoing saga after that first film, so I was curious to see how they would manage to continue the story when they got to New Moon. Well, it’s certainly just as boring. The one and only thing I will commend this movie for is that they at least addressed in some small way the general creepiness of the Edward-Bella relationship. Sure they just mention it in passing, and try to laugh it off, but there is a moment when they talk about the fact that a man that is literally hundreds of years old is seducing a teenager. Aside from that, there are no redeeming qualities in this film. The first big flaw in New Moon is that a large chunk of the movie involves Edward leaving and all the relationship stuff being taken over by Jacob. This is a problem because Robert Pattinson could act better than Taylor Lautner in his sleep. Lautner actually manages to be worse than Kristen Stewart, and I didn’t think that was possible. He is utterly devoid of charisma, and never once convinces me that he is falling in love. Combine that with Kristen Stewart’s expressionless staring into the middle-distance and you have the worst love story imaginable. As part of this stupid relationship we get to see Bella once again proving herself to be utterly clueless. Despite constant blatant hints and obvious clues, she is simply dumbfounded that werewolves exist. However, the more egregious problem with New Moon, and the reason it made me actively mad, is how it handles the break-up of Bella and Edward. I know it can be devastating to have your heart broken, but this film is so committed to the idea that these two are soulmates and have some supernatural bond, it sends ridiculously harmful messages to teens everywhere. Not only is Bella reduced to wailing in such a dramatic fashion that a responsible father would probably force her to spend time with a therapist, but it gets worse than that. At the idea of never being together again, both members of this couple feel that suicide is their only hope. It’s dark and depressing, and exactly the opposite of what we should be teaching young people. I don’t have much more to say about New Moon, because not much else happens in the movie.",SHOW MORE,The Twilight Saga: New Moon,The Twilight Saga: New Moon - Movie Reviews

This movie's main issue is that its main purpose is to create a love triangle and it does little to move the plot forward. The world is explored a little more and there are some exciting moments near the end, but this movie still doesn't have enough to make it worth sitting through. The first movie was just okay but this one feels like it doesn't do much in terms of plot progression.

It's like a broken car that won't start so you have to push it. The acting isn't as horrendous as the first but it's script is still incredibly weak and shallow. The plot feels like it could have actually been tolerable but it never really reached that stage. A big issue with the first film I had was that it felt like the plot was an afterthought in exchange for shitty character interactions. This film does the same thing but Jacob and Bella's dialogue is slightly more interesting than her dialogue from the previous film. Ultimately I can say that this whole series is a big disappointment, if I remember correctly the next movies have a lot more story driven elements or maybe they don't I don't remember.

4507,Jacob B,"Jul 21, 2019","""A whole lotta nothing in between somethings"". That's the precise sentence that an article I read summed up New Moon as. Guess they were onto something. Not only is the pacing incredibly slow but all the things that the first film had bad, this movie does worse. The acting is worse, the script is worse and it's hard to take seriously. With cringy dialogue, an overlong runtime and unlikable leads. Basically the Cullens leave because Bella got a papercut on her birthday and she spends 3 months sitting on a chair sulking and apparently that's all she did in those 3 months, seeing as how she never changes clothes and nothing in the background looks any different. The few things the movie has going for it are: some decent-ish, if disappointingly brief, action scenes with some decently rendered CGI werewolves and Michael Sheen's performance. Shame he's not in a whole lot of it because God forbid we put in someone who's good at acting, regardless of film quality, and have him stay there for more than 10 minutes. We wouldn't want the other actors to be revolting now, would we? Also, why doesn't she stay with Jacob? True, I already know who she'll end up with (I haven't felt this much suspense since Katniss, Peeta and Gale) but Jacob actually does have more dimensions than sparkly Cedric Diggory ever had. And I'm not saying that because we share the same first name. If you're a Twilight fan, more power to you. But if you're not, this movie is so boring. Even if the franchise was already fairly short on action to begin with, that doesn't excuse the fact that barely anything happens of interest despite being a story about vampires and werewolves.",The Twilight Saga: New Moon,The Twilight Saga: New Moon - Movie Reviews

4513,JOHN U,"Aug 25, 2021","They had us in the first half, not going to lie. Though I was really happy with the direction this film immediately went for in creating a soft sort of post-apocalyptic world for humans and apes to get along in, I wasn't exactly sold on the approach that this film took. It was just under an hour of nobody trusting nobody, blunders being made and guns being waved and while it was certainly wrought with tension, it was the stressful, unpleasant sort of tension because both sides and all the stand out characters on both sides (except Carver, He was just an idiot) have such believable and pitiable motivations and social predicaments that the idea of conflict between them (something I knew was eventually going to come) seemed completely undesirable. With the plot moving so slowly at the beginning, it was slightly agonizing to experience. However, there was enough interesting character dynamics (Caesar and Malcom, Caesar's son's apprehensions, Koba's stirring hatred, Maurice with everyone but especially Malcom's son) and visually resplendent world building to keep the film going until Koba does the fateful deed. After that, the film blooms fully into it's singularly unique, compelling, tragic, chaotic and almost operatic identity. I think it was the only right decision the writers could have made to have the apes strike first. After the first film we have sort of been conditioned to see the humans as the enemies of the apes and what with the enormous arsenal and testy nerves of the human colony, it seemed that the oppression of the apes would soon come again. It was exactly the development the Caesar and the apes needed, a conflict, betrayal, a villain in their midst to drive home that the apes are not intrinsically better than the humans. The moment that Caesar realizes this, lying wounded in front of his son, brought low by the betrayal of his own kind and humbling himself by returning to the home he had moved on from is a powerful moment and what I think the entire film was leading up to. Caesar and Malcom both realizing the worth of the other's kind and acknowledging each other as friends. On a big picture scale, the apes trilogy is using it's second installment to level the playing field between apes and humans to set up the climax of the third act, but it does so in an explosive and poignant way. I think the flavor that this film has that most science fiction action films do not is a feeling of tragedy. Not tragedy in the sense of failure, but in the conflict and mistrust between and within the apes and humans that inevitably will lead to great strife. This film has action, drama and heart but each of these is given a vein of tragedy. Thankfully, it is the kind that is epic even in it's laments and drives some hard hitting questions home as the apes become smarter and stronger. Heck, not only do they talk a lot more, by the end they were speaking in metaphor while beating the snot out of each other. It may sound odd, but that kind of thing is what I think the apes movies are made for. Another significant advancement… have I mentioned that this movie is very good as a sequel? Paying homage, carrying themes over from the first installment while giving the narrative further believable direction and a wider focus? Well now I've mentioned it, and the greatest thing about it is the increased inclusion of the best character in the series: Maurice. Maurice already has the advantage of being an orangutan which is makes him cuddly and imposing at the same time, but he also gets the singular honor of being the good friend to the main characters and since not as much attention is given him, he is not tarnished by a lesson needing to be learned or a flaw to correct. He's just pure awesome. When he turns his piercing eyes toward Malcom's family and utters his one word in the film ""run"" I got chills. He's just a peaceful, understanding presence and he's the only one who gets along with both sides (something I wished could've happened for everyone) and when he had to, he grabbed that ape and showed him who's boss. I love that kind of character. I was genuinely concerned when he got shot but was relieved to see that he just shook it off like the bad-A he is.

The middle film in his trilogy sees the imperious Andy Serkis reprising his role as Caesar in a post-apocalyptic world, where most of the human race has been wiped out by Simian flu (yes, it's more topical than it was on its release date). Caesar clashes with fellow ape Koba over the way in which to approach the human race leading to a split amongst the colony, and resulting in civil dispute. Weta digital's visual work is nothing short of remarkable, and the communication between the apes is staggeringly realistic. Serkis is the star, as he his throughout the franchise (utter shame on Oscar for not recognising his work) and the way the physical performances of Serkis and co combine with the special effects to give you a world in which you truly believe everything is real, deserves the highest of praise.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes - Movie Reviews

There was some deterioration for me that big critics didn't see, namely that the dialogue between the apes seemed intended to be rudimentary but was in reality just very poorly written. They didn't seem to gesticulate enough to convey the emotion the lines were meant to have and so the subtitles just didn't match up for me. I think they improved the CGI on the apes but did so at the cost of doing rather poorly on the herd of deer and the bear in the opening scenes. I loved the heel turn of Caesar's lieutenant, the overall plot and the film score, which was top notch.

Maybe I had my expectations too high, or maybe the film is just missing that something special, movie was not upto the mark. The acting was okay except Ceaser's (whose acting was great). The plot was good but little bit stretched. The pacing was also problem but not a big one. Overall, you will enjoy the movie but it has some limitations.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes - Movie Reviews

4541,Alef M,"Aug 29, 2020","""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" mantém a essência do primeiro, mas não só isso, explora as possibilidades reais do acontecido e as evolui de uma maneira incrível. Toda a semelhança entre os primatas e os humanos é muito bem explorada aqui. Seja em relação a cultura, método de caça, respeito, medo, conceito de família etc. Uma ótima sacada do roteiro foi situar uma realidade onde os primatas estão em constante evolução, já os humanos em declínio. Eles nem se quer tem energia elétrica, um dos pilares mais básicos. A evolução do personagem ""César"" é brilhante. No inicio da obra, o mesmo acreditava que era melhor que os humanos, já no final seu pensamento mudara. Ele percebera que os mesmos eram muito mais parecidos com os humanos do que ele desejara. O filme deixa claro que os humanos foram inconsequentes desde o principio. Além de criar um vírus, conseguiram a proeza de criar uma nova vida inteligente. Mas o que mais me chamou atenção foi quais sentimentos o protagonista e antagonista aprenderam dos humanos. César aprendeu a amar, pois já esteve com um humano verdadeiramente bom, que lhe deu um lá e o acolheu. Koba foi um objeto de estudo e sofreu a sua vida toda, logo aprendeu a odiar. O mesmo já tinha um espirito antagônico desde o primeiro longa, e sua evolução ate´aqui é satisfatória nesse sentido. A cinematografia desse filme chega a ser poética em diversos planos, rendendo ótimas fotografias ricas em conteúdos sub-contextuais. A ost também esteve bem presente e a mixagem de som foi muito bem feita. A direção de arte no que se diz respeito aos primatas e a cidade também está de parabéns. Não posso deixar de mencionar a voz de César, que tem um peso ABSURDO. A voz de Koba também é muito marcante, e inclusive, a diferença no tom e tonalidade cria um contraste muito interessante entre os macacos.",Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,Dawn of the Planet of the Apes - Movie Reviews

4549,Matchell C,"Nov 07, 2021","'Transformers' is a movie that I hold dearly to my heart. I watched it over and over on loop almost every day as a kid, I was hooked. I loved it because the action was cool, the main character was my idle, and the robot cast had cool designs. But how does this movie hold up, now that I'm a little older? (surprisingly well actually). The movie follows Sam, a young man who has bought his very first car. But little does he know, that this car is an alien from the planet cybertron. The aliens have come down to earth, in order to obtain a powerful item, the allspark, a relic that can give life to machine, and repair the robots home planet. There are two factions fighting for it, the autobots (good guys) and the decepticons (bad guys). On the one side, the autobots believe in the right for all life forms, while the decepticons only care about power. The film also follows William Lenox, a soldier that was attacked by a decepticon, and now has to fight for survival. The movie ALSO also follows this Australian hacker that provides a bit of plot progression, and that's it. The plot is pretty cool, and the way that the movie focuses on multiple characters is neat, but how do the characters play out? Sam is quite charming, due to his interactions with characters being oddly comical, in a certain type of way, and is probably relatable to a lot of guys. His love interest however is incredibly dull. Mikaela is nothing but a love interest, she has no personality, and she just willingly does what the characters tell her to do. William and his team of soldiers were funny, they had a few memorable one liners, and William has a nice motive and a cool action moment towards the climax. As stated before, Australian girl is just there for plot, but her friend, Glen, is incredibly funny (also some great one liners from him). Other characters such as Sam's parents are very interesting characters, Simmons is again another funny character, and that's about it for the human characters. The Transformers themselves (character wise) are really lame in comparison. All five autobots have personalities, but you don't get to see them that often, as they: A. don't appear that often. B. usually fighting most of the time. C. have dialogue that is strait and one dimensional, especially Optimus's. There is also a moment in the film were one of the robots, Bumblebee, is captured, and it's played as an emotional moment. However, you don't feel anything because you barely even know the bot because the movie never gave Bee enough room to show his character. Megatron and his decepticons are very intimidating, but they have little personality, outside of being big baddies. The reason why a lot of people don't like the film is because of the focus on the humans, and not the Transformers. Personally, i'm 'okay' with it, but I don't think it's something that would completely ruin the movie. As of the action scenes, they are awesome. Watching the bots beating each other up is very amusing, and is only helped by the wonderful CGI, that still holds up to today. The Transformers all have a certain shade and glossiness that makes them fit into the backgrounds. Their transformations are incredibly satisfying, with all the funky sound effects and moving parts. The overall designs of the Transformers had people divided, but these are the ones that me and a lot of other kids grew up with, and they're all just as good as the original designs. In conclusion, 'Transformers' (despite not being that much about them) is a really good movie, thanks to its funny/memorable human cast, awesome action scenes, and CGI that still holds up to this date, highly recommend.",Transformers,Transformers - Movie Reviews

But Michael Bay's need for out of place awkward and strange banter seep in to the film and make you feel uncomfortable at times. There were no proper payoffs, certain things were mentioned and not seen again. It didn't have a lot of why I like transformers, distinct character personalities that are complex and fun. It had some interesting observations about human beings, and I'll admit it was cool seeing the live action iterations of different autobots.

4556,Puroo R,"Aug 18, 2021","As a kid I didn't know that Transformers is a set of toys. I only used to think that it is an anime series. The first time I learnt about the movies was when one of my friends got a Nexus tablet to school and played this movie when there was no teacher in the class. I really liked the opening scenes and decided that at some point I will watch this movie. Little did I know that the opportunity will come 8 years later when the lockdown would happen. I watched it and enjoyed it very much. Transformers is exactly what I wanted to watch when I used to see the terrible anime. I didn't like Optimus Prime very much back then but in this movie I understood why he is so important to the franchise and now I am a huge fan of Optimus Prime. There were so many other Transformers whose names I got to learn as I watched this full staff I used to see this movie in parts on TV and I used to think that Bumblebee was Hotshot. After watching this movie I was feeling like replacing the the logo of my car with the Transformers logo. All the Transformers movies have very good CGI, cinematography, choreography and colour grading. What the other movies lack in, however, is a good story and acting. This movie has all of that. I really wish all the other Transformers movies were also like this. Here I cared about Sam, the army guys and of course, Mikaela (°""U""°). This is one of the only two Transformers movies which actually has a good plot (the other doing bumblebee). If the future Transformers movies had built up on what this movie created they could have actually been very awesome. But instead they focused more on creating a bigger universe with more cars and more merch to sell rather than on character development. I can often come back to watch this movie because of the cool cars and fight scenes, without having any of the cringe the future movies had.",Transformers,Transformers - Movie Reviews

4558,Anaadi G,"Aug 03, 2021","This film is a true gem that is sometimes neglected owing to its numerous sequels. Unlike the following several, this one has legendary humor. Along with the 1986 film, this is an outstanding masterpiece. Unlike some of the subsequent films, this one features some well-written human characters that are both interesting and entertaining. The photography is superb and the film appears to be really stylish. The narrative revolves on a teenage boy and his car works surprisingly well and feels like many of the more classic Steven Spielberg films such as Jurassic Park or E.T. The dialogue is really good and Glen is very relatable. I think that the way they portray the Decepticons in this movie as absolute hulking unstoppable beasts that you need to work together to defeat was really cool. The designs for the transformers are menacing and aesthetically pleasing. All in all there's a lot more than meets the eye to this film!",Transformers,Transformers - Movie Reviews

Where this movie loses all the points for a good movie is all the humans. OMG are they stupid af. Shia Lebouf is the only one that I actually liked, and if that's the case, you know they're bad (pre ""Peanut Butter Falcon"" Shia, let's not forget). Yeah, Megan Fox and Anthony Anderson are very annoying, especially Anderson, who is just yelling a lot. Fox isn't as bad, but she just there for eye candy for the pubescent boys watching.

4592,Tristen M,4d ago,"After watching it for the first time in maybe 3 or 4 years and thinking about it. I don't think I hate Amazing Spider-Man 2 anymore! Is it convoluted? Absolutely. Is there too much in it that goes absolutely nowhere (mainly because they were questions to be answered in a conclusive chapter of a trilogy) yes maybe a little too much! Are the origins for the villains a little cheesy or bad? Maybe they weren't bad maybe it was just the execution of it because I could be wrong but I think they draw heavily from Ultimate Spider-Man comics. BUT the score is incredible, of every single Spider-Man movie we've ever had ASM2 is the absolute most gorgeous and visually stunning. No movie is this fucking cool looking. Andrew gave his performance 110% and his chemistry with everyone even someone giving as bad a performance as Dane DeHaan seems to work for the movie it is. Every actor gives everything they've got in this and you can tell, it's not like Spider-Man 3 where you can tell that almost nobody cared and because everyone's acting is so good in this the emotional moments do hit and they often hit hard!!! Honestly this to me has the best, most accurate portrayal of Peter Parker; funny and smart as hell that's not just trying to impress Mr.Stark, what he doesn't know we see him actually try to figure out without the solution being ""Oh Mr.Stark put this in my suit already!"" Most of my issues with this movie has always been that I hate (and still do) that a looooot of the plot is heavily solved through pure coincidence. That whole plane massacre sequence at the beginning of the movie where Richard Parker is fighting for his life to try and upload his confession video not to send it to a news station, not to send it to someone he knows will do something good like Ben or another scientist, not the police, he sends it to his private computer currently sitting in a secret laboratory under an decades abandoned subway terminal that you only have access to by inserting in these specific slightly different subway tokens that are hidden inside his calculator that Peter only found because he got mad and threw the calculator and it broke and it just so happens that the video sent was also an apology to grown up Peter. Yeah that's absolutely convoluted and even with my newfound respect and even liking for the movie thinks that whole thing should have been cut. But look at the villains, all the groundwork is there. Their stories are actually well grounded and good, it's just the performances that made them seem stupid. Max Dillon becoming Electro; he's a man whose always belittled, bullied at work by EVERYONE despite being one of the top people in his field, has no friends had to buy his own birthday cake and sing Happy Birthday to himself that when he finally gets power he can exact the revenge on those who've wronged him! That's an awesome origin story it was just the weird direction in how Jamie Fox, who I don't blame for the bad performance, director Mark Webb other than Amazing Spider-Man had only done indie romcoms. And even with the weird writing and directing Jamie Fox gave it his all. Harry Osborne his mom died and his dad never cared about him, sent him away when he was really you and rarely if ever saw him or thought about him again. The first time he sees his father in years he's on his death bed saying ""Hey, this disease I have. Guess what? It's genetic haha!"" Then he has to learn to trust Peter because everytime he's made a friend or thought he did they only liked him for his money! And I do like that subplot of Oscorp trying to push out Harry but trying to figure out how. That too is great groundwork for the bad guy. Now this I do blame Dane DeHaan for because he's reacting to everything right but there's still just something about his performance that makes it seem cringey. Paul Giamatti gave the worst performance of his career as the rhino but hey no movie no matter how great is perfect. But the fight choreography in this is Incredible, it's not like a lot of superhero movie fight scenes where either it's too dark or the camera is too shaky and you can't see what's happening or there's a lot of weird cuts and transitions that you still can't see what's happening. This was a for a while my absolute least favorite comic book movie right up there with shit like Superman 4 and Batman Forever and Robin but being that I haven't watched this in years I do admit this is now a guilty pleasure. It's by no means simply due to the plot issues a good movie but I do enjoy the good aspects a lot more now.",The Amazing Spider-Man 2,The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - Movie Reviews

The entire film does not feel complete, and the ending feels rushed over. The villains, Electro especially, are all just forgettable despite the cast that is behind it. The action and humor still lands though, and Garfield and Stone continue to play their characters very well. The conclusion leaves a very sour taste in your mouth, especially when considered that there is no sequel to follow this up, which was originally planned.

Plus, the storyline does not make sense, the main problem being: Max Dillon idolizes Spider-Man before becoming Electro but becomes a villain after becoming Electro. 🙄 And for reasons I cannot explain, the death of Gwen Stacy just wasn't moving.

His portrayal of Harry Osborn is my personal favourite- he manages to make us feel pity, disgust, annoyance, and empathy, all at different points for this tortured character. I would have loved to have seen more of DeHaan's abilities and talent in the ASM franchise. *SPOILER ALERT* Marc Webb's directing is absolutely phenomenal and genius. When Aunt May reveals that Peter's father was a traitor, the camera angle tilts- Peter's work has been turned on it's side, it has become askew.

Los efectos especiales son impresionantes, el spiderman de Marc Web tiene el mejor balanceo, Peter en esta pelicula tiene sin dudas el MEJOR traje de spiderman en el cine, el Soundtrack es espectacular y la muerte de Gwen Stacy hizo llorar a mas de uno. esta pelicula tambien tiene fallas, villanos como Rhino realmente no tienen importancia en la trama y salio muy poco en pantalla, al igual que el duende verde. Electro si fue un buen villano y creo que de hecho es el mejor de esta saga de peliculas, aunque pudieron haberle dado mas profundidad al personaje.

4606,Rafael R,"Oct 15, 2021","WARNING: THIS REVIEW HAS SPOILERS! The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the worst Spider-Man film until then. The cast from the first movie still does a great job, but none of the new characters works. Harry Osborn is a poor version of the emo Tobey Maguire with a bit of Draco Malfoy. The actor is terrible and his arc is badly developed and also rushed. Electro is the worst Spider-Man villain in the cinema of all time. Jamie Foxx here is as invisible as his character, who has no motivation for hating Spider-Man (Lizard also didn't have, but at least he was imposing). And the romantic arc, which was masterfully done in the first film, becomes a ""To All the Boys 3"" but with Noah Centineo's character being the protagonist. There's no history. The best things of this film are: it deepens on Peter's parents backstory, the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone still works and Gwen's death is painful and touching. Oh, and the movie should have ended in the funeral scene, and everything after it could be post-credit or middle-credit scenes.",The Amazing Spider-Man 2,The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - Movie Reviews

Infelizmente o filme acabou se perdendo por causa de tantos subplots envolvendo futuros projetos para essa franquia que acabou sendo cancelada... Eu consegui me divertir muito com esse filme. Acho que foi o único filme que me deixou com um ar de ""o que acontece agora""? Infelizmente o 3° filme não aconteceu, e eu sempre me pergunto como seria o 3° filme. ""Teria sido melhor ou pior que os 2 primeiros?"" O Espetacular Homem-Aranha 2 tem comédia, romance, ação. Tudo o que um filme do Homem-Aranha deveria ter. Esse filme é uma das adaptações dos quadrinhos do Homem-Aranha simplesmente perfeita, tanto que parece que estamos assistindo o Homem-Aranha ultimate em live action. A atuação do Andrew e da Emma também ajudaram a salvar o filme. A trilha sonora também não peca, Hanz Zimmer caprichou nessa. Não me arrependo do que vou dizer... Esse é um dos filmes preferidos de comic-book. Os efeitos especiais desse filme são uma coisa de outro mundo. Marc Webb nos entregou um filme ""puro"" Homem-Aranha, e ele fez isso muito bem. Infelizmente a Sony atrapalhou cortando cenas importantes para o desenvolvimento de muito personagens, como por exemplo da Felicia, ou do Max, que infelizmente acabaram sendo esquecíveis.

4616,Stephy S,"Sep 01, 2021","Even more of a mixed bagged than its predecessor, The Amazing Spider-man 2 improves on the good parts of the original like its protagonist and the chemistry between the cast, but it butchers so much stuff. The saddest part is, it felt like director Marc Webb had a clear vision for the sequel but the studio interfered and forced him to shove another villain in at the last second. Speaking of villains, one is poorly written and just lazy, and green goblin's development is just non-existent. The pacing is god awful during the second act and every subplot feels out of place, the sinister six setup feels like Sony was just trying to make more money by teasing them and the story arc of Peter's parents (if you can even call it a story arc) has no place in the story and doesn't have a satisfying pay off. Nothing we learn about them is something that subverts our expectations, it's all old news. That being said, Peter Parker, Gwen Stacy, their relationship and Gwen's death scene are all phenomenal. It's strange seeing Marc Webb being able to deliver on arguably the most powerful death scene in any movie, and then also be the man responsible for Electro and Green Goblin. There's not much more I can say that hasn't been said yet, it's corporate pandering, it's lazily written and could've been so much more if they just focussed on one villain and expanded on the dynamic between said villain and Peter. If only there had been a The Amazing Spider-man 3, maybe that would've been the golden child of the series.",The Amazing Spider-Man 2,The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - Movie Reviews

It has a lot of problems. It's clunky, some of the narrative hooks don't go anywhere. There are a lot of characters, and as a result, they can be a little one-dimensional at times. But was it fun? Yeah, it was A LOT of fun. I loved how boyish this film is. It feels bratty and raucous, and that's fun. Horror films lack a lot of fun these days, and this makes me enjoy horror. Seeing kids being scared of supernatural monsters is way more convincing and scary than seeing 30 year olds getting scared by the same thing. This film clearly learned all the best lessons from Stranger Things, and applied them admirably. Again, is this good? Not especially. It's kitschy. It's silly. It's sloppy. And that's why it's good. Sometimes you just want something messy, and this fulfills all those needs. It's not a bad time. Additionally, this is an exceptional horror film for high school age kids.

Specifically the pacing; there are long stretches of time that focus on Pennywise and the external stakes, but it all goes to a halt for the entire second act, which completely fudges with the momentum the audience is already feeling.

4637,Nathan D,"Oct 25, 2021","It takes the simplistic world of 1989 and twists it upside down to a disturbance-filled land of absolute craziness. The film does not get anything amiss in all departments. The script is very well written and has a lot of aspects that support the overall vibe of the horror flick. There are many lines in It that bequeath an impact after the viewing is over. The themes of youth and individuality loom over the film in such a tangible way. The screenwriters also handle most of the film's characters well. A lot of the characters have strong character development with good backstories to strengthen their actions. The two characters I would say have trouble connecting with the rest of the story are Mike and Henry. Both characters do not feel strong enough to grasp their goals. Mike is better than the two named, yet he still feels disconnected from the rest of The Losers Club. Henry makes no sense by the 3rd act of the film and seems a bit off from where one would expect him to be. The film also runs for a bit too long as it gets slow in the second act. Having the movie be under the 120-minute mark would have made the film feel more like a continuous flowing story. Andy Muschietti holds the reins on the film as the director and does a pretty solid job. Muschietti has a lot of innovation when it comes to the environment Pennywise lives in. However, the imagination of Muschietti does not feel right visually. The film looks and feels like A Nightmare on Elm Street, yet it does not have that same surprise factor as the film mentioned. Pennywise is great, but having it be a bit more spontaneous would have made the film feel more elevated. The cinematography also suffers from this problem. Chung-hoon Chung is not wrong with his work. However, it does feel a little constrained and repetitive at times. The most shining visual aspect of It is the production and set design. The art direction combined with the stunning sets and locations is outstanding and helps hide some of the other visual flaws. The cast of It is the most compelling component of the film and makes it what it is. Bill Skarsgård is jaw-dropping in the film. His performance of Pennywise shapes the movie so astonishingly well. When Skarsgård first speaks in that opening sequence, it sets a chilling, disturbing tone. Skarsgård keeps that tone throughout the whole film. Jaeden Lieberher leads The Losers Club and honors that title in his performance. His sentiments shine bright in the third act, and he does not disappoint. Sophia Lillis was also such a powerhouse as she portrayed Beverly in such a powerful way. Jeremy Ray Taylor's performance was loaded with emotion and sometimes hard to watch as he made his actions feel very real. Finn Wolfhard and Jack Dylan Grazer are the funniest out of everyone in the cast and have a lot of great lines that stick throughout the film. Lastly, we have Chosen Jacobs and Wyatt Oleff. Both have solid line delivery and needed to be on screen more often. It is disturbing yet holds a strong message with incredible themes that make the film feel comprehensive and modern. The influential performances from all the cast members hide the slight script problems and lackluster visuals at times. In the end, It will surely make you think twice about ever wanting to see a clown in person. Read more reviews like this at postcreditreviews.com",It,It - Movie Reviews

However, ultimately it was a huge disappointment. At first the movie was decent. The plot was good, there was character development, and it was funny. It gradually declined for me. As I find it annoying how this movie solely depends on CGI for the jumpscares/creepy moments. There are plenty of great movies out there that don't depend on CGI or jumpscares in order to scare an audience. A great example of this would be the movie ""Get Out"". There is little to no CGI/jumpscares in that movie, and yet it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The atmosphere is creepy as it is, so it would be unnecessary to add CGI in this instance. CGI only works where it is necessary, in my opinion. In the TV Show Stranger Things, they use CGI to recreate a giant monster. So it was necessary to CGI. Whereas the CGI in IT makes it come off as cheesy. Pennywise could be just as scary without special effects. This is why IT will never be one of my favourite movies.",It,It - Movie Reviews
4660,Joo G,"Jul 14, 2021","Yeah, it's one of the best horror movies, although it's not an total example of the genre, I myself didn't feel a real fear, but that doesn't mean it's a quiet movie, it does have its moments of tension and you can get scared. Well, I confess that I had to watch ""It"" twice. In the first one I didn't feel a good immersion and, because of me and maybe the film, the experience was not so good, I would say apathetic. I say this because I couldn't get on with the narrative and when it got into gear, I fell behind, I don't think I was in the ""vibe"" of a horror movie, so much that some important and tense moments in the movie were boring and even funny, beyond what questions unanswered, which I imagine will be answered in chapter two, weighed more heavily on my experience than they should have. However, I decided to give it a second chance, this time I saw the film more focused to value the experience, and I must admit I had a much better experience, well, first I would like to highlight the character development, which is exceptional, very well built, and , even if it takes a considerable time, it is important to sustain the story and the presentation of the characters, making the viewer feel part of the group of friends and care about them, it is clear that this development is better done in some of the than others, but overall it's pretty good. Achieving this empathy for the characters is already half the way for a horror movie. Another point is the great performance of Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise, he manages to masterfully employ attitudes and gestures in the character that only contribute to his terrifying construction. In summary it's a very solid movie, which in theory is a horror movie, but it fluctuates between genres in a nice way, being a good movie, not only for horror enthusiasts, but for anyone who wants to watch a good movie.",It,It - Movie Reviews

There is nothing scary about this movie as it's beats and formula are so easily recognized that you could almost get bored.

After you realize NONE of these people are in actual danger in any scene they are in, the horror loses all it's power. Oh no the sick kid is being chased by some diseased person, it's so obvious nothing will happen that it almost becomes comical. My favorite part is when they finally get to pennywise's layer and there's like this weird five second dance routine he does that had me laughing, like this is scary to some people?!

4691,Connor B,"Oct 28, 2021","Interstellar is not a typical sci-fi save the day run of the mill film, and the heart of this film carries a message I think everyone can learn from. Interstellar takes the tropes of space travel and grounds them into reality time is everything and exploring space has the ultimate cost of time. Time is the most important resource in our lives. Yet there is something ever more powerful than even time itself that this movie presents. Our emotions and our connections with others are ever present. We are humans and we seek to connect no matter the cost, and despite being millions of light years away and time pressing forward in an endless march our connections will grow, break, and form anew. Because as cheesy as it may sound, despite the nihilistic nature of our existence our bonds and connections with others can be just as effective and quantifiable as any part of known physics",Interstellar,Interstellar - Movie Reviews

The negative reviews are from people who probably try to one-up everyone else's story at a party. There is something for everyone in this movie. The acting, the cast, the plot, the cinematography, the emotional ride... everything about it is spectacular and I feel this may only be appreciated decades from now, as we continue to learn more about the universe/space etc. I've seen a number of reviews that say that Interstellar is ""over ambitious"" but I couldn't disagree more. It's one of the most ambitious movies ever directed and not only did they pull it off, they nailed it. When it comes to the expansion of our universe, I don't think anything is farfetched, but Interstellar made me feel as if I was journeying into our future and watching a real-life space exploration take place, rather than a science fiction flick.

For that reason it was interesting to watch. If you pay attention to the seemingly unending production/distribution credits of modern films you'll see an ever-increasing impact of Chinese capital/influence. The movie was okay. I imagine it would have been better for me if there was descriptive video. I was just thankful it had English dialogue overdubbed. Still, being a big action production I'm sure I missed a lot. This film was based on a set of short stories by the Chinese novelist Liu Chixin. Chixin won a Hugo Award for the ""Three-Body Problem"" which is also recommended by Molly Wood.

4712,"Sep 13, 2021","It's a combination of ""Gorath"" and ""Armageddon"", with an all-Chinese cast, propaganda colors, flattery to the Chinese authorities, and produced by skilled filmmakers. I watched this movie as a prep for watching it on Netflix because it was written by the author of Three Bodies, so I didn't have high expectations, which was to be expected. The director of Three Bodies is new and young, and his sensibilities are modern and I'm sure he won't be overly dramatic, so I have high expectations. The only thing I'm worried about is whether the production team will be sensitive to the Chinese authorities since the film deals with politics such as the Cultural Revolution. That's my only concern. 妖星ゴラスとアルマゲドンが合体、中国人ばかりの出演者にして、プロパガンダ色をいれて中国当局に媚び売って、熟練の映画職人が制作した…感じ。 三体の原作者でNetflixで視聴する前の予習として鑑賞したので期待はしてなかったから予想通り。三体の監督は新鋭で若く、感覚も現代的で大げさな演出はないだろうと思うので、大いに期待してる。ただひとつ気がかりなのが、文化大革命等を政治も扱う作品だけに制作陣が中国当局に忖度しないか？ってことだけ。",SHOW MORE,The Wandering Earth,The Wandering Earth - Movie Reviews

4719,Tony M,"Jun 06, 2021","Like Communist Russia, Chinese writers have found that the sci-fi genre lends itself to futuristic imaginings and alternative universes that can circumnavigate or disguise prickly topics. Especially if those sci-fi writers or filmmakers include some nationalistic nuance while chasing their own creative dreams. This nationalist strain first came to my attention while reading Liu Cixin's otherwise dazzling 2006 novel ‘The Three Body Problem'. It's a sprawling space opera that can be boiled down to a China-led planetary resistance against a pending alien takeover from afar. As I ploughed through all three tomes of this series, I was at once wowed by its sci-fi inventiveness and perturbed by its China-centric visions of the future. At first, I thought it was because I had spent a lifetime reading and watching American and British sci-fi. And indeed, there are enough American-led and American-filled spaceships in the genre to fill up the entire Andromeda Galaxy. Another example of American cultural imperialism, some might argue; while others might contend that American writers are perhaps entitled to populate their fictitious spacecrafts with their ilk, having landed the first man on the moon and now a crop of rovers on Mars. Ken Liu, translator of ‘The Three Body Problem', was quoted in 2016 as saying that, ""When you go into space, you become part of this overall collective called ‘humanity'. You're no longer Chinese, American, Russian or whatever. Your culture is left behind."" For a preeminent translator of science fiction, it's ironic just how wrong Ken Liu was about the near-future of his genre, not to mention the evolving space race between the U.S and China. For it appears the Chinese are taking a leaf out of the American playbook by rushing to assert their own brand of sci-fi nationalism alongside real-world advances, such as their landing a rover on Mars and another on the dark side of the moon. Those lingering suspicions about Liu Cixin, meanwhile, were finally borne out by the transformation of his novella ‘The Wandering Earth' into China's highest-grossing science-fiction film of the same name in 2019. Once again we have the scenario of a China-led planetary resistance, this time against a future global catastrophe rather than aliens, which brings nations together in a herculean effort to save mankind by rocket-boosting Earth all the way to Alpha Centauri. Whatever the naivety of Cixin's cultural viewpoints within this far-fetched story, the scriptwriters made sure to excavate and amplify the story's nationalistic undercurrents, so much so that China basically becomes the saviour of the universe (cue Flash theme song). For all its spectacular effects, the movie's Sino-jingoistic perspectives are worrisome at times, above all that climactic scene where diverse nationalities, including Russia and Japan, all come together to selflessly work as one – under Chinese hegemony, naturally – to get some thruster or other restarted. All that brotherly pushing and grunting for one common goal is like something out of a propaganda poster for the Cultural Revolution. Still, it's a far cry from China's recent past when you couldn't direct or show any films about ghosts, zombies or ‘un-scientific' subjects.",The Wandering Earth,The Wandering Earth - Movie Reviews

You folks calling the performances cheesy or poorly played...have you ever seen a kung-fu flick or an action anime? That's just how they roll sometimes, quirky and over-dramatic. Like hip-hop, it may never be your jam, but recognize they're coming from a different school. 3. This film is all about the viz. Feels very much like a live-action anime. And they nail it. So no the characters aren't groundbreaking, the plot and pace is shaky, and the science is almost laughable, but it's strong at what it does do well, and that's visuals. That other stuff is just window dressing with this type of flick. It's just like how kung fu flicks are all about the kung fu, who cares if sensei's character is under-developed.

4729,Adrian B,"Dec 01, 2020","Chinese blockbuster-style action-scifi/disaster movie with shallow character development and lots of flashy visuals. I did like some of the plot twists, they were just surprising enough, not quite the same tired crap that Hollywood keeps throwing at us, but I especially liked two big refreshing aspects: 1. It underscores how everyone has to unite behind a single large-scale plan to effectively tackle large-scale problems (typical Western individualism and competitive attitude will not solve Earth-scale or humanity-scale problems, if anything such attitudes will be - or are already - an obstacle in themselves) 2. Its vision is actually imaginative and ambitious, it's not just the boring old ""let's restore life to exactly what it was before the Big Problem hit us (let's get back to business-as-usual)"". It's a huge project that will not produce any benefits for hundreds of years and yet is still presented as the right thing to do and the heroic endeavor to believe in, vs. the usual quick-payoff short-term goal to ""just return life to normal"" of jaded Western scripts. Hope to see more of this type of vision in future movies, because Hollywood stuff these days is just completely uninspiring crap - all they can show in their sci-fi is the world going to s**t and humans unable to stop it and just ending up with some dystopian BS as the new normal.",The Wandering Earth,The Wandering Earth - Movie Reviews

It's unclear why Qi is so eager to leave home forever at the beginning of the film, and that's what essentially starts the plot of the movie, and his resentment towards is father is barely explained with a really awkwardly-timed flashback. And this issue is even worse with the side characters. Rescue team 171 shows up 25 minutes into the film, and they play a major role in the plot, but they're never actually introduced. They have a big dramatic moment at about the 1 hour mark which is kicked off when a member dies of exposure, but it fell completely flat because I had no idea who that guy was, and the other characters' emotional reactions just came out of nowhere. There were lots of small details that were equally grating. The cuts are structured so it's often unclear how much time has passed, and it's hard to keep track of where the characters are and how they got there.

4759,"Sep 28, 2020","The Twilight Saga: Eclipse could also go by the alternate subtitle “Hurry up and wait.” This movie tries to create tension for basically its entire runtime that there is an onslaught coming from some evil vampires, and then spins its wheels as everyone prepares while simultaneously wallowing in angst. It is agonizing to watch and mind-numbingly dull. The romance stuff that fills the majority of the film is so painful. There is nothing but a ton of cliché, and horribly-acted “romance.” I cannot help but be creeped out by these relationships, and they seem almost 100% unhealthy. I’d like to say the climax somehow adds enough excitement and action to save the film, but it is so ridiculous and is filmed terribly. There is no intensity or excitement to these battles, they are just people using CGI to run faster or jump higher than you can follow with your eyes, or to turn into a cartoon wolf. Then they start ripping body parts off the bad guys. In a strange choice, to avoid an R rating, it seems that vampires are made out of cement and when killed they just crumble apart into pieces and there isn’t an ounce of bloodshed. It doesn’t help that I don’t care about any of these characters, but I was so bored by the whole thing even in its most action-packed moments.

The acting is slightly better, it's actually quite fun to see Edward and Jacob trash-talking each other, Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson have better romantic chemistry and I actually did appreciate the build-up to the big action sequence which was actually quite awesome. Yet Eclipse, despite having being cinematic enough to warrant an IMAX release, still falls into the same traps as the last movie thanks to dialogue that's hard to take seriously (""Dad. I'm a virgin""), slow pacing (though admittedly not as bad as New Moon) and an uninspired script. Rather shocking considering the screenwriter would go on to be a showrunner for an admittedly good TV show. But then again, having a script faithfully following a Stephenie Meyer book was probably destined to be not good. Also, for the movie that fully focuses on that one evil vampire who's out to get revenge on Bella and Edward, she doesn't really have a lot of screen time. She's not even played by the same actress. The summarized Entertainment Weekly review of ""The best 'Twilight' movie so far"" is right but that's not really saying much.

Ghost Protocol has numerous scenes to satisfy that audience- Hunt swinging out from a 150+ story skyscraper to (hopefully) get the momentum to get back inside; a car chase through a sand storm; escaping Russian soldiers at the Kremlin just as it begins to explode along with gas beneath the street. Yeah, there is some clumsy, overly obvious 'lead-them-by-the-nose' writing at times. C'mon guys, at least some of your audience is smarter than that. Is the actual Russian really gonna confuse Hunt for a Russian too, even though he speaks with no Russian/Slavic accent at all along with poor pronunciation? Are all female agents and assassins busty bombshells there to manipulate men's baser urges? Cruise is...Cruise, so he's great for this part. Pegg's was a cliche, but not a big distraction.

It's so suspenseful. While the plot is quite predictable, you're always wondering how or if our heroes will win because there's so many instances where they almost lose or narrowly escape and it just makes the action scenes so intense.

4814,Movie M,"Feb 01, 2021","Reviewed 1.25.21  The 4th installment in the Mission Impossible series serves as a reboot for the film franchise.  After the diminishing returns of the original trilogy, Ghost Protocol introduces key new characters, via the acting chops of Jeremy Renner and Alec Baldwin.  And of course Tom Cruise ups the ante with even more ludicrous stunts, many of which he performed himself.  Most famously, he hangs off the Burj Khalifa, still the tallest building in the world.  These additions, along with the increasingly influential role of Benji Dunn (performed with aplomb by the irrepressible Simon Pegg), do indeed inject much needed vigor.   Unfortunately, it all gets mired down in a clunky story that fails to capture the imagination.  It's a retread of the 'nuclear annihilation' storyline that has been beat into the creative ground for 70 years now.  Additionally, the scattershot nature of the plot leads to constant confusion.   In the end, the film is best viewed as a setup for the stellar films to follow.  For that reason alone, it's must-see for fans of the franchise.

4825,Chris G,"Sep 13, 2020","The third Mission Impossible completely changed the style of the franchise and the way in which it looked and felt. It made the franchise feel up to date and modern again and a film that everyone could enjoy. The 4th film decides to build upon that and take it to that next level! The stunts and action sequences felt bigger last time. Ghost Protocol instantly takes that to another level within the first 25 minutes of so of the film. The prison escape and Kremlin scene give us more hand to hand combat, bigger and flashier gadgets and a thrilling explosion and chase scene that all beat anything show in the third movie. You have to admire Tom Cruise as well. Say what you will about him but he has a bit ol' set of balls on him! The stunts he's performed over the years have always been awesome but in this 4th instalment he outdoes himself and puts himself at risk to give us an even more crazy and authentic type of action sequence that blows us away. A lot of Hollywood actors would leave this to the stunt men but Cruise does it himself and is such a perfectionist that he always strives to go bigger and better than before. The one thing with these Mission Impossible films is that they all seem to fall under the same story. Don't get me wrong I still love them despite the fact it seems every single time either Ethan or his whole team seem to get disenvowled from the IMF and cast out as the bad guys when it's clearly obvious they're the good guys. You would have thought the IMF would have learnt by now not to jump to conclusions when it comes to Ethan. That being said there's usually a mole or traitor in the organisation so I can understand why they may not trust anyone fully. This reoccurring plot point doesn't spoil the film it's just you kind of know each movie they're going to be struck out on there own and it is kind of lazy writing despite the fact we never dwell on it. Jeremy Renner's addition to the cast as William Brandt is a welcome one. You can see they really wanted to set him up as the next Ethan Hunt but Cruise hasn't lost a step as the lead agent so that transition never happened. He is still a welcome addition to the cast but you have to feel for him a bit. He was brought in here and in the Bourne franchise to take them both forward as the leading man and both times they went back to the tried and tested leads. That may be because Matt Damon and Cruise are both irreplaceable actors and characters. This is the first movie that also really linked the others together with a lot of mentions to the 3rd instalment and Brandt being closely linked to Hunt's wife apparent death. Making the movies tie together is a clever choice and makes for a more cohesive franchise. Talking of welcome additions the expanded role given to Simon Pegg's character Benji is a masterstroke. He appears more in the first 10 minutes of the film than he did the whole of the previous movie. Having him in this more prominent role works so well as he's an excellent foil for Hunt. With Ving Rhames part in the movie limited to a end of movie cameo we needed a partner for Ethan to work off of. No offence to Rhames but Pegg just works so much better working with Ethan. His brilliant brand of comedy makes Hunt seem more likeable as well. He's just a light hearted character whose comedic moments are welcome and don't distract from the film and never feel forced or unnecessary. Ghost Protocol is a step up from the previous film in every way but one. The villain here is weak. I genuinely forget each time who the big bad is in this film. With the first three instalments we had the brilliance of Phillip Seymour Hoffman and memorable actors like Jon Voight and Dougray Scott. This time around the villain is just pure and utter forgettable and never really appears enough in the movie to be remembered. That makes the end part of the film suffer more than other instalments and makes you switch off just a little bit. For this movie to go to that next level it needs as more engaging bad guy.

Christopher McQuarrie's announcement that he had begun work on Mission Impossible's 7 and 8 adjacently was music to my ears, and Rogue Nation is a huge part of why. McQuarrie's two instalments thus far (Rogue Nation and 2018's astounding Fallout) have been alongside the best action films of the decade, the epitome of popcorn cinema done well. McQuarrie's relationship with Tom Cruise is the main reason why we are getting this, and their work on the serviceable but forgettable Jack Reacher series was very much the warm up for the main event of what will end up being Mission Impossible's 5 through 8. Rogue Nation will fill your saturday night with thrills.",Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation - Movie Reviews

For me it's the greatest spy action franchise of all time (sorry 007) and even though I really enjoyed the previous 4 installments, to me Rogue Nation and Fallout are just masterpieces. Rogue Nation has Rebbeca Ferguson's Ilsa Faust as one the best and most exciting characters in the franchise history. She is truly the equal of Hunt. Sean Harris is also one of the best villains this series gave us, and the film is full of amazing set pieces chief among them the Vienna Opera segment and the Casablanca tank dive followed by a very exciting motorcycle chase (I am not even going to dwell on the exciting opening). More importantly, Fallout owe Rogue Nation a lot, because without Rogue Nation setting up all the right pieces, Fallout would not have been as fantastic and exhilarating sequel to it . To me I go back and forth between these two as my co-champions, and because of them I am so much looking forward to 7 and even 8.",Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation - Movie Reviews

It takes the intense concept of Ghost Protocol of IMF being disbanded and Ethan having no help to him being a fugitive and hunted by the IMF. What a concept! And combied with an unpredictable story that keeps you on the edge of your seat and wondering what will happen next and seeing Ethan and everyone having to make these tough devisions, you get probably the most intense MI movie.

This movie it have many sectors for me I think it is done well in every sector, sector that I like the most is five sector. My feelings at first look is so funny and amazed by the equipment because the equipment of both the hero and the villain is very high-tech, and the villain's boos is so smart that it is not just a fight movie, is has a strategy to defeat the other. This movie doesn't writing that protagonist so too good. In this sector the equipment that I like is It is a duck trump that can be converted into a gun. The selling point of this movie is that the protagonist has to go on an impossible mission, In this sector the protagonist's mission is to steal one of the files stored in a secret research center inside a military base. But there is no wat to get into it unless our information already exists in the system to pass through the security system. The first security system that must be faced is an officer card is required to show it to the guards. And when you passing through, you will go down bottom floor by the elevator that must be to scan the fingerprint to press the lift. And when go here at the bottom floor you'll pass three six-digit code doors, each with a unique code. A previous visitor security system if you do not have your information on the system. You might just be able to get through it. But you can't go through the last one. The last security system is the camera. But it is very different from conventional cameras. These cameras have all the information that What are the staff members of this place like? What is the walking posture? What parts will you move when walking? These boxes know the behavior of each employee. Without your data in the system, you can't go past these cameras. If these cameras detect your position and they do not match the information in the data base It will immediately fire an electric shock at you. But it is very difficult to put data into storage. Because the information is stored in the liquid tank under the plant. The liquid tank is designed not to be able to carry metal into it. If metal enters, the door will automatically lock dead. The distance from the tank's path to the storage takes about 2 minutes. In which the hero will have to change the information in the system in which the hero has to breathe for 3 minutes because he cannot take the oxygen tank down to change the information and come out of the tank. I very like this movie. In other sectors, there are many impossible missions for the hero to do.",Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation - Movie Reviews

4893,Movie M,"Feb 03, 2021","Reviewed 1.26.21 It's quite the achievement when the 5th installment of a series is the best-to-date. The story involves a sinister organization known as The Syndicate, whose aim is the antithesis of the IMF (Impossible Mission Force, for the uninitiated). The action is top-notch, and the plot keeps you guessing. And the cherry on top of it all is the introduction of a scintillating new character, Ilsa Faust, played with mysterious beauty by Rebecca Ferguson, in her breakout role. The influence of writer/director Christopher McQuarrie is clear. Both the structure and execution are taut, and demonstrate the sure-handedness of a creator with action/adventure chops to spare. From the genius of The Usual Suspects script he penned 25+ years ago, to his more recent experience guiding multiple action packed movies, his experience has come to bear on a franchise in desperate need of inspiration.",Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation - Movie Reviews

4903,Chris G,"Sep 17, 2020","The answer to that question is probably given in the first scene. In each film I've applauded Tom Cruise for his lack of fear and creativeness when it comes to his stunts. The opening for this film for me is by far and away the most brilliant yet. Hanging out of a plane is something most actors would pass over to their stunt doubles. Nah not TC. He will do that just to make sure we know he's not scared of absolutely anything. He instantly just goes to that next level AGAIN and we're blown away by it. Making one of the most memorable moments in the whole franchise and instantly setting this movie off down the perfect track. My main grumble with the 4th instalment in this franchise was the villain. He was basically easily forgettable. I only watched the film a few days ago and I can't remember what he looks like let alone his name already. Rogue Nation though doesn't make that mistake. In fact they correct on that in the first 10 minutes of the film. They introduce a instantly recognisable villain in Sean Harris's: Lane and make him a threat straight off the bat. Not only do they introduce him but they give us the larger threat of the Syndicate which is a group that could destroy the world. So instantly we have a face to put to the name of that group. It's excellent story telling and within the first 15 minutes or so the movie is off to a incredible start that it never lets up. One thing they do once again in that first 15 of the movie though is disband the IMF. OBVIOUSLY. They bloody love this plot point. But once again the film around it is so good we don't dwell too much on this tired retread. Rogue Nation again keeps adding to this team feel they're trying to create. They introduce us to Rebecca Ferguson and Alec Baldwin's characters who you know instantly are going to be major characters not only in this film but going forward. Ferguson is a great foil and love interest for Cruise and she is a improvement on Paula Patton's Jane from the previous film. Jane isn't mentioned at all in this movie which I do feel is a mis step as they seem to want continuity but you have to explain why major characters from previous films are missing. Baldwin is brilliantly over the top. His lines especially when describing Hunt and the IMF are some of the most exaggerated and ridiculous I've heard in a long while but because it's him saying it they seem to work. With Harris absolutely sparkling as Lane, Rogue Nation does an excellent job of introducing new and compelling characters that many films struggle to do this far into it's history. Having even more Simon Pegg is a masterstroke once again. The writers have quickly realised how important he is to this franchise and it seems with each film they're bumping up his role. This film makes him a completely pivotal character who plays into the major moments of the movie! One character who is slightly relegated from his role in the last movie though is Renner's William Brandt. He was brought in with the idea that he would replace Cruise as the lead after Ghost Protocol but as the film did so well and Cruise showed no signs of slowing that idea was scrapped. Whereas he was shown as a major force in the last film in this one he's shown as a side character only whose main use is to have some comedic back and forth with Rhames. He's solid but that's a major relegation from where he was meant to be! The movie has some truly brilliant scenes. The opera scene is one of the best in the entire franchise and again appears pretty early in the film. This movie starts off brilliantly and never relents. The story moves along at a frantic but natural pace throughout and only brings you in more and more. They build on the Syndicate's introduction and make them and Lane the most calculated and dangerous villains the IMF have ever faced. In this instalment more than any other the film relies on elements of comedy. With Pegg leading the way as usual and the weird team up of Luther and Brandt we get some moments that truly tickle us. That never takes away from the film but rather adds to it and makes it that little bit better. The cast chemistry is through the roof in this one as well. Cruise and Ferguson have a much better chemistry between them than he did with any of his previous love interests. Patton is well and truly not missed in this film and I doubt we will ever see her again in a MI. One thing I hate though and that's not just in this film but films in general is how they give Brits such stereotypical and horrendous accents. The head of MI6 is guilty of that and it just comes off lazy and annoying. We don't all have posh or cockney accents all the time. It's a lazy troupe that Hollywood pedal out in so many films. They really need to break from this stereotype as it's just flat out annoying now. Rogue Nation is the best Mission Impossible to date. It's built on successful ground work from previous films and then fixed some of the flaws those movies had. The film starts off hot and just gets hotter as it progresses. It is the perfect Mission Impossible film and it's going to be very hard to top.",Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation,Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation - Movie Reviews

4913,Meydiana R,"Nov 19, 2021","Combining elements of comedy, motivation to satire. Forrest Gump, a film directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring veteran actor Tom Hanks, manages to instill very deep moral values in every scene. The film, which was made in 1994, deserves to be called the best film of all time. The film, based on the novel by Winston Groom, tells the story of a man named Forrest Gump. Forrest who since childhood was considered a stupid child with an IQ of 75 has a unique life story. Having been belittled by everyone, Forrest continued to go forward with a stupid label by others against him. Forrest Gump is an epic film that makes the audience realize that behind the shortcomings there are many advantages in each person. The nature of the main character Forrest Gump can certainly be a good example for everyone. So what kind of traits can we imitate from Forrest Gump's character? 1. Loving Parents We can see how much Forrest Gump loves his mother. In the film he is willing to swim from the ocean and run through the city when he hears the news that his mother, Mrs. Gump is sick. Forrest Gump certainly realized that his mother's struggle could not be reciprocated with anything. The mother who always supports Forrest in the midst of his shortcomings makes Forrest realize that his mother is his hero 2. Always positive and optimistic Although Forrest Gump is known as an idiot character in the film. But his stupidity is not a problem for a Forrest. He keeps going and always thinks positive. Don't complain and always try. In the film, Forrest Gump always shows his positive nature in any situation and in any crisis. Can you copy this? 3. Never give up and be generous Of course, if you have watched the Forrest Gump movie, you will realize how generous the character Forrest Gump is. After he managed to create a shrimp company with the initials of his friend Bubba Gump Shrimp Corporation. He and Lieutenant Dan, a character frustrated by his disability during the Vietnam war, started a shrimp fishing business. After repeatedly failing to catch shrimp at the beginning of his search for shrimp. Forrest Gump didn't give up. He tried many times and of course failed many times. Until one day his shrimp catch was successful and together with Lieutenant Dan he managed to create the most successful shrimp fishing company in his city. Forrest Gump, who seemed to be a very successful businessman, didn't feel happy.Until finally he handed over his company to Lieutenant Dan and gave his income to the Bubba family, his best friend who had motivated him to start the shrimp fishing company 4. Good promise holder Bubba is a black man whom Forrest met when he joined the military. Forrest and Bubba's relationship is quite unique. It's said that their friends don't seem too close. But this is the other side of the Forrest Gump movie. Bubba, who when he was with Forrest, always talked about the world of shrimp, of course, for many people who listened to him talk about shrimp, it was quite boring. But not with Forrest, he always listened to Bubba talk about shrimp and Bubba's dream that when he finished his military duty he would set up a shrimp company with Forrest. But unlucky, Bubba died on the battlefield. Until it was left Forrest with his promise with Bubba to set up a shrimp fishing company. Instead of burying the promise. Forrest kept his promise to his best friend Bubba by successfully founding a very successful company, the Bubba Gump Shrimp Corporation. Forrest's promise and dream with Bubba finally came true 5. Don't forget friends and best friends in any situation The next Forrest Gump trait that you can emulate is that he always helps anyone. You can see it in the film even in critical times when Forrest and his troops are attacked by the enemy. Had separated well with his best friend Bubba and Lieutenant Dan. Forrest did not want to stay silent, he finally returned to the battlefield and saved his friends who were still alive even though they were full of wounds. No exception for Lieutenant Dan who he saved even though he had to lose his leg in the end. Lieutenant Dan, who was frustrated with his disability, was angry with Forrest. But again Forrest did not want to forget the Lieutenant Dan. He accidentally meets Lieutenant Dan who turns into a beggar in a wheelchair. Forrest, who at that time was a hero of his country, certainly felt sorry for Lieutenant Dan. Over time Forrest managed to raise new hope for Lieutenant Dan by getting him to join his shrimp fishing company. Lieutenant Dan joins in until Forrest gladly hands over the company he built to Lieutenant Dan. An extraordinary trait. 6. Faithful in love affairs Not only comedy and motivational elements in the Forrest Gump film. Of course the romance drama between Forrest and Jenny can be a good example for everyone. The single love story between Forrest Gump and Jenny seems to break the audience's heart when they see how loyal Forrest Gump is to Jenny. Although he had been separated several times for a long time and many times Forrest Gump was rejected by Jenny and many times he saw Jenny's bad side. Forrest Gump remained standing faithfully waiting for Jenny. He still loves Jenny with all her flaws. Until finally he and Jenny got married. But the marriage did not last long because Jenny had to leave the world early due to a virus due to her wild life. Forrest Gump must have been very sad, Jenny's long-awaited love finally ended briefly. For Forrest Gump, Jenny was his first and last love. 7. Good father At the end of the story, Forrest Gump who has become a father, gives his best love to his son. He applies the love he gets from his mother who is also a single parent. Without Jenny's presence, Forrest Gump performed his role appropriately to be a good father to his son. This film deserves to be watched and imitated in our daily lives because there are so many valuable messages and moral values that we can follow in this film. This film, which has been nominated for 13 Academy Awards, you must watch this at least once in your life!!!!",Forrest Gump,Forrest Gump - Movie Reviews

His childhood leg problem inspires Elvis Presley, he unintentionally mocks Lyndon Johnson's showing off his surgery scar, he goes to Maoist China to play Ping-Pong, he unintentionally starts the 1970's jogging fad, etc. The book's story was purposely contrived; the movie plays everything straight. As for those who claim the movie glorifies stupidity, the phrase ""Stupid is as stupid does"" has a more honest message, namely that stupidity isn't an inability to think but an unwillingness to. As for the movie's uncomplimentary view of the counterculture, there was plenty of bad as well as good about the 1960's-divisiveness, racial and other hatred, violence, the spread of venereal diseases, etc. But not only the left gets skewered.

4950,JOHN U,"Jul 01, 2021","Forrest Gump: A Simple Man in a Strange Land. This week I watched the 1994 film Forrest Gump. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film stars Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise and Sally Field and tells the story of a mentally disabled man named Forrest Gump who lives through and witnesses many crucial events of the 60's and 70's and with his innocent, hardworking yet simple nature seemingly lucks into a very successful life. Around Forrest are many people going through the turmoil of the times and while their lives are affected negatively by the tumultuous culture they cannot help being positively influenced by Forrest's simple and sweet nature. What struck me most about The film is what a straightforward and honest approach to filmmaking it is. The story manages to be heartwarming and uplifting without sugarcoating any aspects of what happened in the 60's and 70's and portraying what life was like for many who were young adults at the time. Each and every aspect of filmmaking is masterfully done and every trick in the book is used in it's impressive technical side but it's groundbreaking achievements and magnificently utilized tactics do not point us toward awe inspiring spectacle but instead draw us even nearer as an audience to the harsh realities and human lives that it portrays. I think the movie works so well because it is not attempting to be blatantly nostalgic and not trying to be saccharine about its subject matter but it uplifts the spirit and moves the soul in its soaring heights and devastating lows. It is the drama of life presented in a very real way with one central thing elevating it and lightening all the terrible things we see and hear throughout the course of the film: Forrest Gump. By centering on such a fascinating character that is completely unaffected by the chaotic world around him, who holds stubbornly to his old fashioned values and walks through life with simple goals that are not swayed by the tide of cultural upheaval around him, the film creates a new and powerful way to look at the events of the 60's and 70's but also a unique and meaningful way to look at life itself. The film is set in the 60's 70's but it is not tied down by a single time period. Forrest is a man apart from his time and thus apart from any time. The themes and characters are timeless in the questions they ask and the struggles they face and so a film set so conspicuously in such a crucial time in history is able to speak to what came before and what will come after it in an eloquence that only its title character could provide. Yet another masterclass in good filmmaking in all respects (and recipient of six Academy Awards) all of its many achievements are as nothing to the heart and person at its center and each aspect points in its own way to the man at the heart and succeed in effecting us as an audience much like Forrest Himself affects those around him: innocently and unassumingly taking us along on a journey that will move, amuse and even inspire. Sweet and heartwarming without losing any emotional push for it, Forrest Gump is an achievement in portraying a unique perspective on the world that draws out all of its joys and sorrows in a very poignant way. The film truly is like a box of chocolates, you might not know what you're going to get and you may not always like it but the experience is an enjoyable mix of sweet and bitter and the aftertaste is truly satisfying. Forrest Gump, through its clear direction and talented and dedicated performers and artists, excels at portraying not only the world of Forrest Gump but the world through his eyes. Of course the flow and unity of vision in the film must be attributed to the director Robert Zemeckis and the value of the story lies with the inspiring adaptation work from Eric Roth but if I were to choose two people who defined the spirit of the film for me and truly seemed to understand and convey its themes and messages it would be Tom Hanks himself and composer Alan Sylvestri. The truth of the matter is that without Tom Hanks there would be no Forrest Gump. The words of the character and his life are all printed out in the script but it took an extra special performance to truly hit home how special Forrest really is. It is not an understatement when the poster for the film says ""Tom Hanks is Forrest Gump'' because that is simply how it is. Even with his recognizable face and presence Tom Hanks becomes Forrest Gump, portraying all the simplicity and innocence, loyalty and love that Forrest has in the only way possible. That is why Tom Hanks is Forrest Gump because it could not have been anyone else. I've already said that every aspect of the film points to the man at its center and rests on his character but the character rests on Hanks and he carries the weight with wonderful skill. As Tom Hanks hides in plain sight in the film so does Alan Sylvestri's truly inspiring score. In all ways it is as simple and sweet as the main character but while it is sometimes happily so other times its simple strains can be truly heartbreaking. Each theme is so successful in creating the emotions necessary. The simple bouncing melody that represents Forrest's relationship with his mother, the tragic and somber strains of Jenny's theme and the triumphant brass whenever Forrest is running. Of all the things that give us the lens to see the film through Forrest's eyes it is the score that hides unnoticed most of the time but keeps its spirit of innocence amidst many songs of the time that appear on the soundtrack. The mixing of the pop music of the time with a simple mostly piano instrumental score is the spirit of the film captured completely on the musical spectrum. Surrounded by the culture just like Forrest yet maintaining its beautiful symplicity and emerging at the end as the element that tugged at our hearts even if we did not realize it. In all aspects the film pulls off the enormous feat of placing the audience in the heart of so many turbulent events of history yet keeps us safe in the peaceful protection of Forests honest and well meaning outlook. Forrest comes in contact with some of the worst parts of society and some of the hardest parts of living and yet he keeps going and is not swayed by all that goes on around him and thus we the audience can watch knowing that terrible things may happen but we can still rest in the quiet comfort that is simplicity. This was all said without even mentioning the cinematography, production design and ridiculously unnoticable visual effects and other strong supporting performances throughout the film. Forrest Gump is a masterclass in all aspects of filmmaking and it has a great amount of merit because of it but at the end of the day its biggest achievement is the story it tells with those elements. With a film that covers the highs and lows of three decades of a man's life, one can expect many deep questions to be asked and timeless lessons to be learned. One of the central messages of the film is hinted at in its very first shot of a feather blowing in the wind until finally resting at Forrest's foot as he sits at a bus stop. It is then said explicitly as Forrest mourns at Jenny's grave. He says to her ""Jenny I don't know if Momma was right or if. If it's Lieutenant Dan. I don't know if we each have a destiny, or if we're just floating around accidental like on the breeze, but I, I think maybe it's both. Maybe both is happening at the same time."" The genius of the opening credits of the film is that it portrays this Idea literally while still lending to its message. The feather floats for a long time going in all directions, quite accidental like on the breeze but it finally and inevitably ends up coming across the main character. That was its destiny. And at the end of the credits one almost can think that by brushing the foot of our protagonist the feather is passing the nature of its existence on to Forrest as he recounts the story of his life, a life that he seemed to luck through. Unaware as a feather and just as poised to be blown wherever the winds of his fortune blow. Yet his life is not one happy accident after another. He still has a destiny. That which he sees and pursues. In his simple straightforward way, Forrest is pursuing his destiny much as a feather on the wind. The film's presentation of contrast between the old world of Forrest's and the new world of the sexual revolution gives ample opportunity to ponder a simple question: Does Forrest belong in the world he lives in? In other words, is this no country for Forrest? Yes the question is posed in another more explicit way in No Country For Old Men but hidden beneath the Drama of Forrest's life and the humor and heartbreak of his incongruence with the rest of the world is the question of belonging and Forrest's is an acute case of this predicament. Such is the depth of the question that it can only be pondered and it is too distant for a concrete answer on paper so I can't even begin to try and answer it. Suffice it to say that there are so many spiritual, cultural and human themes in Forrest Gump, so many joys and sorrows of the human experience that its depth can be pondered long after the Film comes to an end and before that, with so much substance as backdrop, creates an almost overwhelming cinematic experience. At the center of every great drama there is the human person, full of flaws and doubts, misgivings and mistakes but all the while continuing to live their lives for better or worse. The central character of this drama is Forrest himself, so apart from the cares and troubles of the world and yet still doing his part to ease some suffering as he goes through his incredible journey of a life. Blissfully unaware of how truly terrible life can be, Forrest nevertheless experiences so much of the sorrows of life and comes close to so many terrible events that devastated the 60's and 70's. Forrest's relationship with those around him and to the events that surround his life is best summed up in his own words ""I may not be a smart man but I know what love is"" He feels compassion for such men as John F. Kennedy and John Lennon even though he can't fathom as to why they would be killed. He fights bravely in Vietnam and saves many of his fellow soldiers' lives even when he can't even begin to grasp that there is a terrible war going on around him. He cares for his girl Jenny, always looking out for her good even if he doesn't understand what tragedies have filled her life. Forrest Might be mentally unaware of all the events surrounding him but he is very aware of the people in his life and he reaches out to them in the only way he knows, with love and compassion. The two that are most affected by this are Jenny, the love of Forrest's life and Lieutenant Dan, his commanding officer in Vietnam. Both are victims of the time they live in, caught up and swept aside by the culture and the current events. Jenny grows up with an abusive father and when she gets nowhere with a folk singer career she embraces the hippie lifestyle and lives a life of destitution and despair. Lieutenant Dan was saved by Forrest in Vietnam but protested furiously, wanting to die with his men. When he loses both legs to injuries sustained in the battle he too starts a destitute life in Washington D.C. Throughout her life Jenny has come to Forrest for comfort but it is clear that because of her upbringing she does not know how to love a man like Forrest in the right way. She finally realises this and when Forrest asks her to marry him she declines and leaves the next day. Finally after three years she sends a letter to Forrest inviting him to visit her. It appears that after so much time she has finally learned why her life was so drastically different from Forrest's and is living a quiet life as a waitress and caring for her son Forrest Jr. The two finally marry and live their days happily until Jenny dies from sickness. Though Jenny lives a wild life apart from Forrest, his calm and simple presence through it all finally brings her around to recognizing the good in life. Lieutenant Dan is perplexed by Forrest's honest to goodness attitude during the war and afterwards becomes angry at Forrest for it as the two live together for a time. Lieutenant Dan states to Forrest that it was his destiny to die in Vietnam and that Forrest took it away from him. When Forrest goes to start a shrimping business Lieutenant Dan joins him, keeping a promise he made on whim that if Forrest ever bought a boat then he would be his first mate. Through Forrest's influence, Lieutenant finally realises that his life is worth living and at long last finally thanks Forrest for saving him in Vietnam. In taking a choice that may have seemed against a real ""destiny"" Lieutenant Dan and Forrest make their fortunes in a characteristically unexpected way and run a successful shrimping business. Through his childlike simplicity and love, Forrest's life was able to give hope and purpose to two who had none. The characters of Forrest Gump could be relatable but only to a select few. The truth of the matter is that they live human lives, lives that anyone can connect with and be moved by. Forrest Gump is incredible. A mix of bitter and sweet, joy and sorrow, laughter and tears, tragic historical events and flights of whimsy all with its title character in the center, telling us the story of his wonderful life. Though its narrative is powerful it is nearly outshined by the prowess with which it is told. Direction, performances, music and visual effects all bringing a deeply personal story to glorious life. With a strong backbone of cultural, personal and spiritual themes, the narrative hits very deep and can resonate with all people. Of the characters only one thing can be said. The highest compliment I can give: They are human. After watching the film I thought ""this is now one of my favorite films"" and in the course of writing this essay I realized just how much can be said about it. What can I say except it is a true piece of art that tells a genuinely moving story.",Forrest Gump,Forrest Gump - Movie Reviews

Hamuru 8 parçaya ayırıp parçaların her birini güzelce yuvarlayın. Tezgahı ya da başka bir düz zemini bolca unlayarak hamurları tek tek açın. Tereyağını eritip hamurların üstlerine gezdirin. Hamurları dıştan içe doğru sararak rulolar yapın. Ruloları kendi etraflarında spiral olarak sarıp 10 dakika kadar dinlendirin. Dinlenen hamurları yeniden tabak büyüklüğünde açın. Tereyağını eritip içine suyu ve tuzu ekleyin. Yeniden donmaması için kısık ateşte bekletin. Hamurların her iki tarafını da yapışmaz tavada iyice pişirdikten sonra üzerine yağlı sudan sürün.

4962,Severin D,"Aug 02, 2021","The twist that everyone knows has now reached me, a self-declared ""film expert"". Even people who haven't seen The Sixth Sense have heard of the mindfuck moment par excellence. I managed to avoid what is probably the most spoiled movie scene in history for 21 years and all I can say is, I was still completely caught by this twist. The concentration was so much on not missing the decisive moment that the story of a child therapist who helps a child who, according to his own statements, can see dead people, got a bit lost. Yet no end of homage should be paid to the acting performances in this film. Bruce Willis embodies the child therapist Malcolm Crowe, for once a completely different role than what one we are used to from him. No stubborn anti-heroic action hero, but an empathetic workaholic who supports his young patients with everything he has. This has a negative effect on his private life and especially on his relationship with his wife Anna (Olivia Williams), who often sees herself as second best because of Malcolm's iron will to work. Crowe is, on paper, the protagonist of the film. After the initial focus is more on him, he makes room for the real star of the story as the film progresses. The then nine-year-old Haley Joel Osment delivers one of the most profound and authentic performances of any child actor as the psychologically damaged outsider Cole. Mysterious at the beginning, for a long time you don't know what demons haunt this boy and why he behaves the way he does. Only through the later realisation that Cole can communicate with the dead do we understand him better and are immediately fascinated by him. The second half of the film de facto belongs to him alone and we accompany Cole on his way to no longer be afraid of his illusions, but rather to engage with them and find a coherent way of dealing with this ""curse"". Director M. Night Shyamalan knows how to stage this unorthodox character, who doesn't conform to any clichés of children in films, in such a way that as a viewer you always d'accord with Cole's slightly absurd behaviour. A perfect complement to Cole's life is Toni Collette as his mother Lynn. She raises her son alone and struggles to understand how to relate to his weird and unpredictable ways. This strain affects her so much in many parts of the film that Collette is often called upon in emotional breakdown scenes, which she handles fantastically. Quite a great portrayal of grief and the desperate search for logic. If you don't know the twist of The Sixth Sense, the film still provides the big bang despite its advanced age. The question is rather whether you should watch Shyamalan's breakthrough work at all if you already know the twist. The mere fact that Willis appears in a different role than usual, Osment and Collette deliver their best career performances to date, and the two protagonists have very amicable chemistry makes the film worth a watch. It's also an atmospheric thriller, peppered with trippy horror elements, that manages to generate an insane amount of tension. Top directing, minimalist but great music and a terrific final punchline!",The Sixth Sense,The Sixth Sense - Movie Reviews

4974,Birithivy Y,"May 24, 2021","The Sixth Sense - 10/10. M. Night Shyamalan's breakthrough film catapulted him in to the big leagues of directing, and also brought a new voice into the mystery/psychological thriller genre. Revolving the story around a young boy who sees dead people, the film could have easily been a horror film or one that is a psychological drama. But more or less, this is an excellent drama first, diving into the mentality of the young boy (played amazingly by Haley Joel Osment), his mother who struggles with raising him (a fantastic performance from Toni Collette), and the psychologist that helps the young boy (a revered and surprisingly subdued performance from Bruce Willis). Its a movie that has some scary scenes here and there, but the gist of the story is propelled by the excellent tone and atmosphere brought to life by M. Night and cinematographer Tak Fujimoto. Its a dark and dreary film, mixed in with this coldness that you rarely find in PG-13 horror films. Also, you can't talk about this film without referring to the plot twist and literal red herring's that happen through out the film. Its quite an amazing feat for a young director, to establish a film full of small details that the viewer must be keen on noticing while watching. It makes for a much more attuned viewer and creates a sense of purpose to each and every scene. An excellent thriller that sparked a wave of copy cat films and inspirations. But, the original will always be the best!",The Sixth Sense,The Sixth Sense - Movie Reviews
4975,Ethan R,"May 24, 2021","The Sixth Sense remains Shyamalan's best film to date because of its effective suspense, horror, and solid emotional core. However, it's not perfect. It's just a dash heavy on tropes (cue the spouse watching the video of a wedding). And if you know the twist going in, which nearly seems impossible if you've been exposed to any pop culture, the film is probably not going to be 100% effective. Osment gives a performance far greater than his years here, and is supported by solid, workmanlike efforts from Willis and Collette.

The color scheme, tempo, and suspense of this film is truly remarkable. Plus, it does not rely on cheap scares by ghosts to provide horror, but on the story to strike fear in the audience and provide scenarios so much more frightening than any jump scare. Also, the twist ending everyone is talking about is extremely brilliant, and even makes the second viewing better. This movie is a classic piece of cinema every film fanatic must see.

4991,Alex H,"Nov 11, 2020","I never believed that I would find a film that would give me the same emotions as the movies that were already on my top ten list, but this film astonished me and I am very happy I have got to see it. When I started watching, I thought it would be a horror and nothing else, being ready to say how overrated this movie is and how I don't believe that anyone likes it, but, the further the plot got, the more amazed I got. I only saw in the end of this film that it was directed by Shyamalan and I was shocked, as right now there is barely anything good coming from that director. As well as Bruce Willis, who right now is not an A tier actor anymore. This film is an emotional ride, as it makes you sad, happy, amazed and scared. I found myself actually scared because of the jumpscares, even though I understood they were coming, they worked really well. They were not screams, they were just people, dead people. Such intense moments help the viewer understand what the main hero could have felt while seeing a dead person. Music is outstanding, as it makes for the greatest part of the film's experience, but actors are even better. This is Bruce Willis's best performance ever, in my opinion. The thrilling part of the movie is outstanding, as you never know what is coming next and you never believe in what you have just seen. The whole plot leads you into creating theories and making countless questions, which is what I consider a good film. The ending is the best part of the film, as it comes to the logical conclusion and it is a massive emotional explosion. It is very good and I have actually cried in the end. There are countless allegories that could be made out of this end and one of them related to me really well, which is why I believe that this ending is one of the best movie endings ever made. This is a true must watch for anyone, this movie is already cult, which is amazing, in my opinion. Honestly one of the best thrillers I have ever watched, which is why I adore this movie so much. A definite 10/10, I wish I could have even gave it more, because this is a film that actually got me touched and made me judge this film by what I felt, not by my standard criteria. Astonishing, amazing, incredible -- there is not enough words to describe my experience while watching this film.",The Sixth Sense,The Sixth Sense - Movie Reviews

I just didn't find it that stimulating. I figured out the big twist at the scene where Malcolm goes to the fancy restaurant to meet his wife. She doesn't acknowledge him at all and that seemed too weird to me. Then that continued for the entire film, nobody but the kid was ever aware of Malcolm's presence so I became certain I was right. And by the time I got to the big reveal, I was just like ""yeah, got it."" And then the movie ends. Like I said, it's not bad. It's just not nearly as great as the ratings it gets.

I love the backstory that they tried to lay out and I liked the idea of how superman is supposed to be conflicted.

5034,Dylan Y,"Sep 22, 2021","This is a modern interpretation of Superman. One not bogged down and entrenched in nostalgia, but one that looks to examine his character to seek an understanding of how he becomes the world's greatest superhero. Is the character perfect? No, he's a god-like being with powers he doesn't understand who was raised by humans who were afraid for his life should anyone find out. He is learning as the movie goes, and eventually ends up in a climactic battle with General Zod. Since this is a grounded take on Superman, there were casualties in this epic struggle between two god-like beings - but that's part of the realism. The fighting between Kryptonians was depicted unlike any other fight, from the speed of strikes to the way Superman gets up after being knocked down (instead of getting to his knees and standing up, he simply starts flying) and that attention to detail is amazing. The movie is very colorful, with the colors emphasizing the mood you should be feeling in any given scene.

5082,Italian G,"Apr 10, 2021","This review contains spoilers. If I had to point out a franchise that I have always loved it is definitely Kung Fu Panda. I have a special connection with this Franchise, having seen all 3 films a lot of times. Reviewing them recently, as well as realizing that they are great films, I noticed that the best of the saga is the second chapter. It intelligently and naturally advances the franchise, taking it to huge peaks. The story is fantastic and leads us to understand many unspoken questions about Po in the first film in an unpredictable and astounding way. The final battle, then, is well done and perhaps the most beautiful scene in the film. Po, as already mentioned, is the absolute protagonist, but the remaining characters also have the right space and the Furious Five are balanced. Lord Shen is the best villain in Dreamworks with a psychology of a true villain, but also the cue for really funny comic moments. The jokes are well constructed. The animations are wonderful. Kung Fu Panda 2 is not only a film that I am attached to, but it proves to be a masterpiece in many ways. With awesome characters, Oscar-winning scripts and gorgeous animations, Kung Fu Panda 2 is the best animated sequel I've seen.",Kung Fu Panda 2,Kung Fu Panda 2 - Movie Reviews

The animation is one of the best I've seen in any animated movie, blending CGI and 2d animation to create a visually stunning film. The script is put together well, and the dialogue is deep, with great philosophical traits. The tone was actually darker than I expected it to be. The heart and the emotion in this film, growing from very well put together character arcs. And thanks to John Powell and Hans Zimmer, this film boasts one of the most epic score of my animated film!

Still, it does everything that a sequel is supposed to do and does it so well. It expands this universe with new locations and new forms of Kung Fu all while maintaining its witty sense of humor and gorgeous animation. But there are three specific reasons why I believe that Kung Fu Panda 2 surpasses Kung Fu Panda. First of all, it manages to develop Po, our lead protagonist (and one of my favorite movie characters), in such a unique way. We think that his arc is complete and yet they find a way to continue his journey of self-discovery. Even though he's a badass in this one, he doesn't lose his charm. Second, the Furious Five are at their best in this film. They've got some great action scenes with Po. Tigress really helps shape Po's character arc in this film and she shows much more vulnerability. I thought this was a really smart move considering how they have similar origin stories (if they ever tried anything romantic with them though...ugh). But the best part of this movie is the villain. Not only is he terrifying, but the writers also found a way to connect him with Po's origin story. And it is done just so beautifully. The Kung Fu Panda series will always hold a special place in my heart. Like the first one, it doesn't feel dated even after it being out for quite some time. I highly recommend it, but not before watching the first one.",Kung Fu Panda 2,Kung Fu Panda 2 - Movie Reviews

5127,The Duke o,"May 19, 2021","I just came from seeing The Hunger Games: Mocking Jay Part 2! Based on the award winning book, the long awaited sequel marks the finale of the film series that made actress Jennifer Lawrence a star and inspired young girls the world over to rock the braided ponytail and take up archery classes. When we last left Katniss Everdeen and her friends, she was in the midst of planning an invasion of the Capitol city in District 1 to seize control of the country of Panam from the villainous President Snow who had just succeeded in brainwashing and turning the love of Katniss' life Peeta and turning into a slobbering lap dog of the capitol. Now, Ms. Everdeen and company soldier on towards The Capitol, destiny and a reckoning with President Snow. I really have to commend this movie on its faithfulness to the book. Director Francis Lawrence really did a great job of turning the book into an action packed adventure. The movie was well shot and the supporting cast did a really good job too especially Jena Malone and Michelle Forbes. The only qualms I have with the movie come from it's dramatic moments between Peeta and Katniss which all come off as hokey and overly manufactured to seem more dramatic than they should be. At the same time, other moments, that actually were naturally dramatic and probably should have been focused on are played a lot dryer than they should have been. Ultimately, I can't fault the movie too much because in actuality, the book played things out in the same way, and what am I going to do about that? Complain that the movie is too much like the book? On the whole, I liked a lot that this movie had to offer. The special effects and action sequences were very impressive and it was very loyal to the source material; so much so that the only things I didn't like about the movie were the same things I didn't like about the book. So if you liked the novels, I definitely recommend seeing the film but if you're just a movie watcher, you might be less satisfied.

5133,Mohammed A,"Apr 03, 2021","Mostly satisfying ending to the franchise with great acting, great emotional moments with Finnick and Prim's death as well as the ending, the visuals and sets are just as good as the other movies, the action scenes are pretty exciting and it has this massive scale to it and it stayed incredibly loyal to the book and stayed unpredictable and different from usual endings. There's some really memorable moments as well like Coin's death, the battle in the sewers and the ending scene. Also, I love how it wasn't just a predictable finale about the rebels marching into the capitol and killing Snow. It has deep themes about the futility of war and tryannical rulers emerging. the However, cutting the book into two parts really affected this movie. Mockingjay Part 1 did drag out a bit but it wasn't a big deal but considering this is a part 2 and the book is pretty short at 390 pages, it made the movie drag and have more build up and it's clear they were trying to stretch it to a 2 hour movie. It also suffers from blindly following the book ironically. Mockingjay is easily my least favorite Hunger Games book (still good but not great) due to infuriating decisions in the story like knocking Katniss out when the rebels finally win as well as not really letting Katniss do much! It's still a good ending but it's no Deathly Hallows Part 2 or Return of the King. (B)",The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 2 - Movie Reviews"

I disliked the first 30 mins alot, too much poor plot development that just isnt really compelling. Hardly any haymitch, the new characters are bad again, and alot of moments at the end just felt off and shouldn't have fallen into place like they did imo. Overall, I liked it ...

5139,"Oct 26, 2020","Part 2 of Mockingjay brings the action back in full force and concludes the story in a satisfying way. The problem with this film is the pacing, you’d think after splitting the final novel into 2 books that it would help but it still feels rushed. We get some great climatic sequences and some hard hitting emotional surprises, but all feels rushed. The cast continues to carry their characters to new depths and the story unfolds into many twists and turns. The ending feels like it accomplishes what the films set out to do, but without a chance to breathe from the final scenes it’s hard to fully be invested how our characters journeys end.",SHOW MORE,The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 2 - Movie Reviews"

5151,Matthew D,"Jun 16, 2020","A fine finale to a great young adult series. Francis Lawrence's teen sci-fi action film The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 (2015) is a massive spectacle featuring insane explosions, large setpieces, impressive CGI, and heartfelt character arcs to conclude Suzanne Collins' YA series: The Hunger Games. Lawrence's direction is solid for the bittersweet end as he makes the action exhilarating, while the Mockingjay's revolutionary losses hurt. He could have done something more experimental as The Hunger Games now feels old hat with so many dystopian coming of age movies around now. Collins' writing is very clever with tyrants and revolutionaries getting critiqued for their brutal methods. I like how Katniss is not the deciding figurehead of the revolution, but merely a symbol of righteousness as The Mockingjay. Her decisive final arrow is a spectacular movie moment, but President Snow's downfall occurs earlier thanks to the people rising up against their oppressive government. Jennifer Lawrence is wonderful as the heroine Katniss Everdeen. She puts the weight of the world on her capable shoulders with emotive acting and stalwart bravery in the face of danger. Lawrence captures the modern woman who can be both strong and emotional without judgement. I liked her as an actress for all 4 Hunger Games films. Furthermore, Josh Hutcherson is great as the brainwashed Peeta Mellark learning to love again. Liam Hemsworth's conflicted feelings are apparent as Gale Hawthorne. Willow Shields is as devastating as Primrose Everdeen as is Mahershala Ali as Boggs. I am sad to see Sam Claflin's Finnick Odair go. I adore the gorgeous Natalie Dormer's courageous camera director Cressida as well as the striking Jena Malone's feisty Johanna Mason. Donald Sutherland is fantastic as he bows down as the fearsome dictator President Snow. Julianne Moore is amazing as the coldly shrewd President Alma Coin. Philip Seymour Hoffman still gets some memorable moments as revolutionary tactician Plutarch Heavensbee. Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks get emotional send offs as Katniss' mentors Haymitch Abernathy and Effie Trinket. Jeffrey Wright is interesting as the tech wizard Beetee. Stanley Tucci is wasted as the propaganda announcer Caesar Flickerman. James Newton Howard's score is the unsung hero of The Hunger Games franchise with his emotionally sweeping music. Jo Willems' cinematography comes up with several crafty shots that frame the revolution and the dictators with equal majesty and gravitas. I just wish Suzanne Collins' writing was stuck to more besides her heartfelt look at teenagers building a new world. The zombies underground and the furry fashion designer was just dumb. I think there should have been more action or Katniss shooting her bow to keep you engaged. The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2 is a bit bloated at 137 minutes, especially when the endings keep coming without satisfaction. I wanted a happier ending I suppose, instead of the bittersweet one with few farewells.",The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay, Part 2 - Movie Reviews"

5204,Puroo R,"Jun 20, 2021","When I was in 10th class and this movie was announced, I had no intention of seeing it, because I haven't seen the last 5 movies. That's how much I lived under a rock. By the time I learnt it doesn't have any prequels the movie was long gone from the theatres. So I finally watched the movie when it came on TV and damn this was a movie I'd have loved to see! Later on I got to know this is based on the Marvel comics, so technically this is the first Marvel movie I have ever watched (because I live under a rock, remember?). The reason why I liked Big Hero 6 so much is because of Hiro Hamada. I have always been interested in robotics and have participated in a robot combat competition myself. Other than that I was preparing for JEE so I was as such very much into science. So right off the bat we begin from a relatable protagonist. Tadashi was also a very nicely made character. When both Hiro and Tadashi go to his college my focus was on how nicely they both talk. It actually feels like they are physically there, as Hiro looks around and Tadashi gives remarks as he gives Hiro a tour. When he shows Baymax to Hiro the part where Hiro thinks he just made a duct tape shows how natural their behaviour was. The other characters were also very interesting, although I don't remember their names anymore since I watched it so long ago. The movie has all kinds of emotions that make it appealing to the audience. It will make one laugh, cry, angry, excited, scared and awestruck. The heroes, villains, story, plot twist, emotional conflicts and even the little details scattered throughout the movie have all been placed very well. Just watching the hero-villain fights didn't let me be seated. Baymax is so cute. The Stan Lee cameo in the end was also unique. Overall I'd say the message of this movie is the most important aspect about this movie. A hero, who has lost his brother who was his only family and has gone into depression, is brought back to high hopes with the souvenir that his brother left him. His brother's friends were there to help him, his step-mother was supportive of him and overall everyone around him was always wanting the best for him. This is what finally allowed him to be the superhero. His emotional conflicts, whether he should entirely act on his feelings or take a calm and collected approach, whether he should kill someone or never harm a person, whether he should use his powers alone or assemble a team, all of this was in his hands. He did everything he hoped will make his brother proud. I enjoyed this movie so much that later on I showed it to my sister and recommended to all the children I met. This is what a movie should be like. It has a good story, memorable people, character development, conflicts, emotions - everything needed to make a good story. These are the most grounded heroes I have seen in any animated movie. I really hope it gets a sequel. I can't have enough of it.",Big Hero 6,Big Hero 6 - Movie Reviews

The superpowers are interesting and creatively implemented, the villain is unique, memorable, and flushed out. Sure, it's childish in a few places and whenever someone says, ""Woman up,"" it's cringe-inducing, but those nitpicks aren't enough to bring the rest of the movie down with them.

5225,Samuel L,"Oct 15, 2020","Big Hero 6 is an overpraised Disney film. It's basically a mix of How To Train Your Dragon when Hiccup rides on Toothless for the first time and Monsters vs Aliens when the monsters don't succeed as a team until the end. In other words, it really wasn't original besides the robots aspect. The superhero concept was painfully child oriented, the twist villain was terrible, and the robots besides Baymax were ridiculous and completely unbelievable. The whole child genius thing wasn't great either. The writing was the biggest let down, and the film could have been more emotional considering the circumstances - it was no Up or WALL-E. Furthermore, the plot was predictable, especially the ending and what happened to the brother. However, Baymax was a fantastic character, the animation was brilliant, and there was some good humour in the first half. The second half was definitely worse and things seemed to get increasingly silly as the film went on. It's an acceptable film, but it's very far from the best animated picture. Most animated pictures have a little bit for everyone, whereas this was blatantly more child oriented.",Big Hero 6,Big Hero 6 - Movie Reviews

I'll start with the positive parts. The animation is excellent, as is the music (nice song from Fall Out Boy). It also has a fair amount of heart, not as much as the film intends to add but still more than most. Now for the lesser things; that aren't bad per se, just not as well done in my opinion. The plot doesn't feel like anything too refreshing, I feel it's a story I've mostly seen elsewhere; in a few areas it kinda reminded me of the sorta stuff you'd see in a Scooby Doo episode, at least in terms of the twists and/or antagonists. I, also, don't love the design for Baymax - making a character with no facial expressions or true emotion always makes it harder to get attached to them. I do like his purpose, mind. As for the cast, they're decent just not memorable to me. Ryan Potter and Daniel Henney are solid as Hiro and Tadashi, I enjoy their bond together. I'm struggling to remember any of the others though. All in all, a good film - it's just missing a couple of things that would've made it greater.",Big Hero 6,Big Hero 6 - Movie Reviews

In an ideal world they would've really knocked this one out of the park and set themselves up for a third movie that might've corrected their diminishing box office returns. Instead this actually felt like a huge mess and most of the blame rests with Rowling here -- she treats her attempts at screenplays like they're truncated novels and apparently eschews the help Kloves might have provided in trimming her work into a functioning movie script. I can imagine reading my way through multiple chapters of plot twists and family business and enjoying it, but it didn't make for a good viewing experience whatsoever. I'm glad they kept the Credence character (apparently they thought they may not) but the entire point of the movie being to figure out whose family he belongs to was deeply uninteresting, especially when the conclusion to this series is already known... it's a prequel that fleshes out the story almost entirely of people who we didn't previously know or care about. They also turned the ""fantastic beasts"" and their suitcase home into Pokemon-esque plot-solving devices rather than emphasizing them the way the title suggested. Other than the bad screenplay I was also displeased to see that Newton Howard had near-completely abandoned his first score in favor of all new material as one of the best things about the main Harry Potter series was the re-use of themes throughout. It sucks that Depp ruined his own career as he really did a fine job here, though they drastically underutilized Dumbledore & Kowalski.

The first Fantastic Beasts movie had charm, personality, new characters with depth, and of course, lots of fantastic beasts! This one pretty much missed the mark on all of these. Leta Lestrange was compelling , but everyone else rang hollow. They completely debased Queenie's character, taking all of her complexity and cleverness from the first movie and blowing it all up to cram her into a tired trope. We know where the main story arc of the series is going, and we're a long way off from it yet. The main source of ""suspense"" in this movie is Credence's true identity: what pure-blood family is he from? I couldn't bring myself to care one iota, and it didn't help that the answer at the end makes zero sense whatsoever. Plot twist reveals at the end of movies should explain mysterious events that occurred earlier. This one explained nothing, and was so preposterous that it's got me rolling my eyes in advance at the inevitable retconning that's yet to come. Or maybe it was simply a lie? In any case, it was a completely unsatisfying ending. The forced connections to the Harry Potter series got tiresome very quickly. McGonagall is teaching at Hogwarts despite it being chronologically impossible! Oh cool, Dumbledore was teaching a kid named Mclaggen! Remember Nicolas Flamel? Let's get him involved! And did anyone really need a Nagini origin story? I'm going with no. No to all of it.

5283,Jonathan K,"Oct 08, 2021","While one might scoff at my high rating of this movie, it's extremely difficult to think of a single Blockbuster that gets every single facet so perfectly correct -- The screenplay is sharp and clever, the story is high-concept yet classical in feeling, the plot has more than a few genuine surprises, the set and costume design is intricate and detailed, the cinematography lush, often times telling a story without words, the action well-staged, the musical score is outstanding and almost every performance is great. It's a fresh take on old ideas and given a polish that only the most competent craftsmen (and women) can achieve. It's not going to appear on many Best Of All Time lists, and in many ways it shouldn't - it's just filmmaking at top-tier master-class level, and with excellent writing to boot.",Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl - Movie Reviews

5306,Jonathan S,"Mar 07, 2021","Shiver me timbers. After the disastrous Haunted Mansion (2003), Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl should have not worked. In 2003, no one was exactly anticipating Disney's live-action adaptation of one of their oldest and cheesiest theme park attractions. However, Gore Verbinski (The Cure For Wellness) directs with such energy and creativity that the story is exhilarating. It's a scary tale about ghost pirates, romance and rum, plenty of rum. The set pieces are well-conceived and feel alive with a palpable sense of history. Johnny Depp's (Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas) iconic creation of Jack Sparrow carries the picture. The way he walks and the way he talks, he just inhibits the character perfectly. Opposite him is the incredible Geoffrey Rush (The King's Speech). Playing the perfect antagonist, the pair riff of each other brilliantly. The Curse Of The Black Pearl remains a rarity that not only met my expectations but exceeded them. I can clearly recall after leaving the cinema in the summer of 2003 eager to see it again.",Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl - Movie Reviews

He has an understandable motivation. Every character is just so interesting and well acted. What stops this movie from being a 5/5 is some lazy writing where characters just appear from one place to a next as though they just apparated even though the task should've been difficult and it's a bit too long.

5314,Paul C,"Jan 29, 2021","Pirates of The Carribean The Curse Of The Black Pearl *****SPOLIERS***** 5/10 Disney's live action movies are kind of like living in a small apartment build unbeknownst on top of a sinkhole. Low ceiling, but super low floor (Live action remakes, Artemis Fowl, John Carter ect.). In this metaphor the first three Pirates of The Caribbean movies get to join Mighty Ducks in the attic above the apartment because the franchise is actually pretty good. The first movie is the weakest of the trilogy however, but still it stands on its own as a solid entertaining pirate adventure. Johnny Depp stars as Jack Sparrow, the world's best pirate, so it may seem anyways. The movie centers around his former crew, trying to reverse an ancient curse by returning once stolen gold. May as well spoil my opinion right away but I believe this curse is the weakest part of the movie. The pirates are immortal as long as the curse is active so any sword fight with them can only end in a loss or a temporary victory. This made the climax of the film kinda boring, as it's just a waiting game to see when the pieces will be returned. The cast of characters is the movie's strongest aspect and thankfully it takes full advantage of it. Jack Sparrow is goofy, but still incredibly savvy and competent. He never seems immortal or untouchable; he faces true peril and struggle. For such a recognizable figure he loses so much and that's fully for the best. He loses his ship, crew, friends, gets captured and then Jailed for his crimes! Fortunately for him meets the world's second biggest simp, behind Jack from Titanic, Will Barton. Will Barton is my second favourite character in this entire franchise, a man whose attraction to Elizabeth's see's him giving up his entire life, home, moral code and career just to deliver her to her fiance. True white night right there, pokimane tier 3 subs and got shit on my man Will. Elizabeth Swan is a capable damsel in distress with an interest in pirate culture, for some reason. It's never really explained, but it's helpful regardless. She's fine, moving on. The comedic relief shines in this movie. The two pirates are the stars of the franchise in my opinion, they're just fantastic. Pintel and Ragetti absolutely steal the show, delivering the most comedic lines and the most memorable scenes. In conclusion, while the finale is lacking in steaks, the movie overall is great. Fun action scenes, great comedic relief and comedic tone. The pirates movie is a solid movie.",Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl - Movie Reviews

The entire story tries to cram too much information into it, and it ends up jumping around a lot to try to fit everything into its run time. However, where I think that this film soars is in its action, especially the battle of Geonosis, which takes up the entire third act of the film. It is absolutely entertaining to watch and the CGI helps it out a lot. The new characters introduced are also very great, and the worldbuilding is some of the best.

5345,Puroo R,"Jun 24, 2021","After the disappointment that Star Wars Episode I was, I couldn't get myself to watch the second movie in the prequel trilogy. But the thing about Star Wars is that there is no way you can possibly hate the franchise no matter what it does. Even if there's one bad movie there's still a new hope (ba dm tss!), that probably the next movie does fix some stuff. And I can tell you with a guarantee that Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones is definitely not that kind of a movie. And no, I'm not scared of some kid marking my review unhelpful who probably lives in the basement of his parents' house. One problem that constantly plagues the Star Wars prequel trilogy is that most of the good stories happen while the camera is not on the characters. There is a scene where Kenobi and Anakin are in an elevator while going to save Padmé from an assassin and talking about their previous adventures. And trust me, all those adventures sound WAY more fun than what we are being made to watch. Most of the characters shown throughout the movie are there just for the sake of being there, without any amount of character development. That's not to say I absolutely dislike this movie. I really like the whole Jango Fett arc. It was one of the most memorable parts of the movie. There was also the colosseum fight which wasn't good but at least it was memorable. Also the part where C3PO accidentally falls on the assembly line and gets his head replaced by another robot. Other than that most scenes are easily forgettable, not as in I have forgotten they ever happened, but rather I have forgotten whether they happened in Episode II or III. I had to look up the scene I wrote in the above paragraph to make sure it happened in this movie. The CGI, once again is terrible. I don't know what's the problem with the cinematography of this movie. It makes it look so boring. And of course, here's the movie where Anakin and Padmé start getting, well. I don't know what's with Star Wars movies and accidental incest. I get it's supposed to be a space opera, but this goes a little too far. Also the acting is super campy. One person will finish the dialogue, then the next person will speak. And I think it's a good thing because of how high the background music is. If two people start speaking together it will become impossible to hear altogether. I had said that I'd try giving another watch to Star Wars: Episode I, which is hard because of how cringy Jar-Jar Binks. But here it's hard because only the Jango Fett scene was fun. This is, in my opinion, the worst Star Wars movie made by George Lucas. Trust me when I say I get no joy from saying all of this. I still had the courage to watch the franchise further, and I'm really glad I did since Revenge of the Sith really redeemed the trilogy for me.",Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,Star Wars: Episode II -- Attack of the Clones - Movie Reviews

What's really odd is that if you look at the Deleted Scenes, there are A LOT of well-written bits of Character-building that were cut from the movie, and I really, really cannot fathom why these were cut instead of some of the bits that made it into the movie, as these are EASILY some of the best moments in the movie. Like, truthfully, I kinda wish that they made an Extended Cut of this movie, because these Deleted bits, if placed back into the movie, would likely make the movie have more impact...It might still suffer from the poor pacing, but everything would actually have more meaning, which is the main thing that this movie lacks: A Purpose. Now, in terms of the movie itself, the dialogue is not of good quality, but it's more 'flat' and 'functional' rather than something the kind of dialogue that fancies itself brilliant but is actually dumb, and frankly, I prefer this kind of bad myself. The image is crisp and the use of HD filming, as this was one of the very first movies to ever do this, was certainly effective, and while much of the CGI certainly looks dated (admittedly some still looks good), the Composites in regards to how everything Practical and Digital fit together still holds up. The musical score is a bit better than that of Episode 1, as is the Acting, although the latter really just brings it from the low-end of Mediocre to mid-tier Mediocre. And lastly, the action is pretty good, but not on par with Episodes 3, 5 or 6. Sadly, the movie also focuses on a love story at the center, and it's really quite shallow and awkward, albeit I do think there's a couple of very small moments that do slightly work. But overall, this is just a somewhat unnecessary movie, as could've ultimately been made into a 15-30 minute story, but I think George Lucas simply wanted his Story to be in a particular place for his Final Chapter, which is certainly fine - the problem is just that this movie suffers as the result of it. Still, I don't remotely hate this movie - I'm just more than willing to admit that it suffers from many shortcomings.",Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,Star Wars: Episode II -- Attack of the Clones - Movie Reviews

5391,Cailan D,"Jul 19, 2021","The Dark World is a textbook example of the ""sequel is worse"" trap. The action, dialogue, humor and story are all major letdowns from its predecessor. This movie also has the unconvincing and lackluster villain problem, as Malekith is underwhelming and doesn't add much to the film. It feels as though he there mostly because the movie needed an antagonist and he was just thrown in there, and he doesn't add much emotion to the movie and overall feels bland as a villain. The script tries to overcome this at a few points but fails to do so. Stellan Skarsgard is done very dirty in this movie with his character becoming a sort of ""crazy person""; this again adds little to the movie and is unnecessary. The actors do their best with their roles, but the chemistry isn't really there for the most part making the movie fairly boring. There are only two things about this movie that are worth watching it for: the interactions between Hemsworth and Hiddleston and the intro of the reality stone. Hemsworth and Hiddleston carry this film from start to finish and have a few nice and emotional moments, and the reality stone helps to further along the MCU storyline, giving viewers a legitimate reason to see this film. Other than that, Dark World is a huge letdown from its predecessor and remains today likely the worst movie released in the MCU.",Thor: The Dark World,Thor: The Dark World - Movie Reviews

5413,Mitchell C,"Jul 02, 2021","'Moana' is probably one of the best musicals that I have ever seen. I also consider it one of the best films that i've seen. The premise of the movie is that a young girl named Moana adventures beyond the reef to put a green rock back into a giant grass lady that creates life itself. Along Moanas way, she takes on sea monsters with a demigod named Maui, who was responsible for stealing the green rock in the first place. Characters in this film are fun, all of them having a personality, and a role. The protagonist, Moana, is fun, energetic and funny, but not to the point where you can't take her seriously. Her conflict is that she wants to 'beyond the reef', but her father forbids her because he's still scared by the loss of his friend. The whole 'my friends gone, feel bad for me!' is mainly there so we can forgive him for being a doo doo kaka to Moana. Moana's grandma is neat, she says some pretty smart lines at the start, but she passes away thirty minutes into the movie. I'm not saying that it's a bad thing, but just something that could of been slightly tweaked. Maui (hope i'm spelling his name right) is one of the best parts of the film. He interacts with Moana in such a way that it's hysterical at times, as he throws her off a boat multiple times, and always just disses her. fortunately, they make up for it near the end, which is nice. For the animation, it was top notch, and still is today. This movie is five years old now, yet the animation still holds up. Now let's talk about what I liked most about the movie, the songs. These musical numbers are so catchy, that I'd gladly download and listen to them in a casual sense. Every single song is a jam, not a single one feels out of place or just not good. Out of all the songs, 'Your Welcome' would have to be my favourite. Over all, 'Moana' is one the greatest Musical/Disney movies to ever exist. I'd highly recommend you checking it out.",Moana,Moana - Movie Reviews

This is the biggest blockbuster I've ever seen from Disney where the main beast driving the plot isn't romance. It's so inspiring to see a female lead who is the hero, and the one who saves her world from what has been stolen from herself. This is how Moana kicked ""Citizen Kane"" out of my top movie spot. She introduces the Goddess in non-scary ways, though we know how certain religious myths have set her up to be a monster. Moana understands the monster has been created by man through theft of the divine feminine's heart chakra, and she's the only one who can give the Goddess her heart back. It's Biblical, which His-Story gave to Moses, and Disney rightfully placed it back in the hands of our beloved Moana. I love you Moana. Thank you filmmakers for making this one.

5424,Italian G,"Apr 26, 2021","This review contains spoilers. It is indubitable how Moana (Oceania in my country) is one of the most loved animated films of recent years. And when I saw the film on Saturday I found a great confirmation of it. The animations have always been great from Disney, but more than ever here I've seen the film literally come to life: the ocean is human and the action is epic. The story is well written, always giving a sense of unpredictability and a great crescendo. The only drawback in my opinion is a meaning given to the villain who is defined as the God of fire, when the initial Goddess and he are the same thing: I did not understand what this means. The characters, even here, prove to be profound and plausible. Moana and Maui are 2 great protagonists, while the chicken, if at times it gives genuine laughter, at other times I would have liked to come in and put an end to being him. Tamatoa is a great character. In general I liked it, but I don't know how I don't think it's a masterpiece like Zootopia that came out the same year: maybe the single elements are excellent and the whole did not convince me .. Despite this, Moana is undoubtedly a film not to be missed and which differs from the usual concept of princesses that has bored me. With photographic animations, deep characters and a story full of surprises, Moana is a great movie",Moana,Moana - Movie Reviews

5455,Italian G,"Mar 16, 2021","This review contains spoilers. Sing. This 2016 Illumination film has been the subject of a lot of criticism, but also people who really like the film, like me. Indeed, to be honest, I never understood any of the criticisms leveled at the film. The story is very well done and does not encounter any kind of inconsistency, remaining substantially consistent with itself. I don't think it's absolutely predictable, but full of unexpected twists. However, the subplots are the real engine of the film: none of this is even remotely superficial, but it manages to give you a glimpse of who the participant of the Buster Moon show is. True, Gunter doesn't have a subplot, but maybe you can explain a little more about him in the sequel. Speaking of the characters they are all nice and no one is incomplete in development or anything. The story nevertheless decides not to make Mike evolve: choice that I understand, but after Mike's scene moved by Meena's performance (one of the best scenes in my opinion) honestly deserved a more dignified ending. All the other characters represent different characters, but above all they do not make Buster choose them immediately: a choice that gave a sense of unpredictability. Between them sprout a camel, three frogs and a giraffe which was soon replaced by Johnny. The animations are very well cared for and colorful: obviously nothing comparable to Zootopia, but it still makes a good impression. The final scene with the ruined theater is simply fantastic. The soundtrack, the backbone of the film, is full of pop songs from the last few years, which is fully consistent with the theme of the film. But there is no shortage of original songs: Set it all free, beautiful rock song and Faith, sung by Stevie Wonder and Ariana Grande. If I have to be meticulous I would have preferred to see other genres of music besides the traditional ones, such as EDM or even reggaeton. However Sing never found it a bad movie, quite the contrary. It's not perfect (otherwise I would have given full 5 stars), but that's okay too. I very much hope for a sequel worthy of this film that can genuinely carry the franchise forward. With funny characters, colorful animation and an unpredictable and at times original story, Sing is a film that can easily compete for places of honor in animated cinema.",Sing,Sing - Movie Reviews

It is arguably the most ambitious film in the series and a lot emotions thrown into the mix. And the humor is great. Although only the animation of pandas isn't that much finished but if you have only this flaw in the movie then you are successful in entertaining an audience. Also, the climax is one of the best.

The humor is also dumber and a lot more hit-or-miss than the earlier installments. All in all, the film isn't bad but it's a far cry from its predecessors.",Kung Fu Panda,Kung Fu Panda 3 - Movie Reviews
5478,DJ K,"Aug 28, 2021","My issues with this movie comes down to one key issue: its relation to the first two movies in the trilogy. This shows through in a number of ways: largely the story and the drastic change in tone. The story of the first two movies has Po out of his depth, coming to terms with a facet of himself through great effort and struggle. In the first, he must come to terms with the responsibility he always dreamed of having, and the consequences should he fail to live up to that responsibility. He goes through a crucible, realizing that every single one of his heroes despises him, and what he represents, then realizing he is expected to defend the valley from the greatest threat it has ever faced. In the second movie, Po must face the man who killed his parents and led a genocide of his people, orphaning him and making him the last of his species. Lord Shen is certain that he killed every single panda. Po must come to terms with his past, and in doing so saves all of China from a despot. The third movie starts by completely subverting the plot of the second. The pandas survived! The reason the second movie exists, and Po's struggle therein, is now far less meaningful. And Po's struggle in the third movie is less interesting and less meaningful than those previous. He's told he's now a teacher, and worries that he isn't able to do his job well. The stakes are far lower, and the emotional impact is similarly reduced. If he can't teach well, then his friends training will suffer until he figures it out. Then, upon arriving in the Panda village, Po just... figures out how to teach. He didn't go through anything in an attempt to figure out how to teach, he just magically got better. The other side of the story, in which Po finds his family while dealing with Kai, is similarly bland. His father, who we've never met and have no reason to care about beyond a single line in the second movie and the expectation that 'if he's Po's father, then we have to care about him', is introduced and immediately we're struck with the expectation that the character deserves the audience's attention and emotional connection. The writers didn't let Ping feel replaced, they didn't let Po wonder why he'd lived without his people for his entire life, and they expected an emotional connection to exist in a vacuum. As far as antagonists go, Tai Lung was amazing and Lord Shen impeccable. Kai threatens far less than his predecessors: Tai Lung threatened the entire Valley, and beyond. Shen threatened all of China. Kai threatened a few dozen characters, less than 10 of which we actually know. Kai doesn't connect to Po's inner struggle at all in the same way that Tai Lung and Shen did. And Kai's attitude throughout is far less distinctive than his predecessors. The humor and campiness of this third installment were also grating, especially after the wonderful physical humor and genuinely intense mood that the first two movies attained at critical points. Meanwhile, the final fights here are interspersed with random panda villagers doing one move, then celebrating, or Po just grandstanding, instead of genuinely reaching out to his enemies as he did in the first two movies. That said, these are far more apparent than the issues above, which took me a while to put to words. I'm far happier just watching the first two movies and considering that the end of the series.",Kung Fu Panda,Kung Fu Panda 3 - Movie Reviews

It does have flaws though.

5499,Charlie A,"Nov 08, 2020","I had to think really hard about my thoughts for this movie. I hold the Kung Fu Panda franchise very close to my heart. I have invested a lot of my time in not just the movies, but as well as the side series. Overall, I think this is a great movie, it just left me feeling very underwhelmed. It still has all of the great elements from the first two films. The animation, the action, and the deep themes are all present in the third installment of this franchise. The new style of Kung Fu that is introduced, chi, was a pretty good addition. Also, I liked how they were able to reintroduce Oogway into the storyline. And of course...you have Po, who is still the lovable and funny lead protagonist we all love. All of these aspects are the reason why I love this franchise so much. However, I still feel that there was a lot of missed potential here and somethings that simply weren't going to work for me. Kai as the villain was fine for me, but he felt much more generic compared to the villains from the previous films. I didn't like how Shifu and the Furious Five were off in the distance for this film (though their minimal amount of screen time is pretty awesome). But my biggest issue with the film is the other pandas (more specifically Li (Po's father) and Mei Mei). The other pandas make the film feel a lot more childish, and I didn't find any of their interactions with Po to be that funny. This was something I expected though, so I wasn't as bothered at that. After, the primary audience for most of the DreamWorks films is younger children. But there were two new characters that I believe were the epitome of wasted potential. First of all their is Po's biological father Li. Considering how the two of them reuniting was the main plot of the story, it seemed like a great continuation of the storyline. But most of their interactions with each other are meant to be for jokes, and when the creators tried to make some emotional moments with them, it felt sort of disingenuine. And then you've got Mei Mei. This flirtatious Panda was the most disappointing part of this film for me because I had such high hopes for her. Giving Po a girlfriend would have been a genius move on their part as it could really help shape his arc as the Dragon Warrior. Her one good interaction with Po is their first one, where she's flirting with Po, but making it seem like he flirting with her. And that's it. That is literally all that she does. She learns how to use nunchucks...and...um...she...uh...yeah that's about it. It might seem like I am being hard on this movie and I am. But it is simply because I know the potential that these movies have. That with another sequel in the works, DreamWorks could give us a franchise that could surpass How to Train Your Dragon. They didn't utilize certain plot points that would have made this movie so much better. If this were the last movie, I definitely would have disliked it much more, but maybe they can make amends in future installments. As nitpicky as I am, I think that this still a great family film that I recommend. Just make sure you watch the first two movies first.",Kung Fu Panda,Kung Fu Panda 3 - Movie Reviews

5531,Jacob R,"Jun 22, 2021","This isn't my favorite Pixar movie (at least not anymore), but it is arguably the best film that they made. One, it's a superhero movie, which already gets a bunch of points from me, because superheros are most definitely my thing, my genre (outside of animation of course). However, besides it being a superhero movie, it's a great character drama about Bob Parr and his midlife crisis. So basically, it's about a guy going through a midlife crisis, but he's a superhero with a family full of superheros. Doesn't that just sound amazing? Cast: excellent. I mean come on, you got Samuel L Jackson in this movie, I don't need to explain it anymore. And this movie might have the best Pixar villain ever in Syndrome. It's technically a twist villain, but done in the best way possible. Honestly, nothing to complain about here. Is there no big emotional moment, no. But this movie doesn't really need that….at all. It's a must watch. Go to Disney+ and watch arguably the best animated movie ever made!",The Incredibles,The Incredibles - Movie Reviews
5532,Puroo R,"Jun 17, 2021","Pixar has made an animated movie on all the different aspects that we see and admire in our life - there's Coco on culture, Soul on life and death, Finding Nemo on marine life, Ratatouille on food and Cars on, well, cars. But the one Pixar movie that completely stands out for me is the one made on the superheroes. I have watched The Incredibles about like, twenty times as far as I can remember (almost always in Hindi), I think I have lost count. And yet it interests me the same way as it did the first time. It's clearly because of all the hard work that went into making this movie. The first time I had heard about The Incredibles, it was when it had a Happy Meal toy ad. I used to hate Violet and like Dash because of how that ad used to show her as someone who bosses him around. The reason why it did so was because it reminded me so much of my family, minus Jack Jack. The father, the mother, the elder sister and the younger brother. The entire theme of this movie is that this is supposed to be a family of superheroes. They are also people just like us, living their life in peace and quiet. It is also visible since they easily blended in with the normal people the moment they got outlawed. This clearly showed that the way we always treat them to be either gods or demons, they are more than just that. Another great aspect about this movie is the animation. It is the reason why I liked to watch this movie over and over again. Now of course all American animated movies have great animations, but this is something completely different. It looks and feels more like a videogame. As a kid I used to often play with my Wii remote when Bob broke into Syndrome's lab, pretending it's a game and I'm controlling him. The textures, the way Omnibot moves around, the fight scenes, everything gives a very videogame-like feel to it, something similar to the PS4 Spider-Man or Batman Arkham. And finally what makes this movie so great is the story and the character development. What made the Parrs so likeable? Because each of those characters are lousy, incompetant and just overall bored of their lives in the beginning of the movie. They have everything they need to make their lives fun, but they have no right to use them. So finally when they slowly get to use those powers, they are getting more excited about it and quickly adapt to the situations. In the aftermath of their fight they have made their lives better because now they are a lot more positive about their future. The Incredibles, in my opinion, is a timeless classic. Everyone should definitely see this once in their life. It's one of the movies that absolutely defines what Disney-Pixar is. I'm really glad this movie got all the fame it deserved, and probably a lot more is to come in the future (games, cameos, spinoffs, even more sequels) since I just can't have enough of this.",The Incredibles,The Incredibles - Movie Reviews

The characters are fun and entertaining to watch and to the point we're I almost thought that they were real people at times.

The voice acting and the story are also great. It's a Pixar film so there are so many little Easter eggs throughout the movie that would take forever to find all of them. The credits are also cool.

Is brilliantly directed and written with lots of humor and creatively explores the issues superheroes would face once they retire and decide to live normal lives. Actors Craig T Nelson and Holly hunter do a great job voicing the characters of Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl with an exquisite performance by Brad Bird as the eccentric Edna Mode.

5567,Molly M,"Aug 06, 2021","Premiering at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, Ridley Scotts's 'The Martian' tells the incredible story of one man's survival after being left on Mars. Spanning over 141 minutes, 'The Martian' brings Andy Weir's 2011 novel to the big screen in a well-paced, well-written affair that features a star-studded cast with Matt Damon at its helm. Presumed dead by his team after a vicious storm during a manned mission to Mars, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) finds himself stranded on the red planet, 385 million kilometres away from home. Relying on his resourcefulness, Mark must find a way to keep himself alive and find a way to signal to Earth that he didn't die while NASA and his crew try to reach him. Matt Damon gives a great performance in the lead role. He does a terrific job keeping viewers interested throughout the film, especially considering he's the only person in the majority of the scenes. The supporting cast, including Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, Sebastian Stan, and a whole host of Hollywood's finest, all give solid performances across the film. Not only does Damon do a splendid job keeping viewers entertained, but Drew Goddard's screenplay makes sure viewers don't get bored when Watney starts mentioning things like hexadecimals and many other scientific details. For the most part, the science behind 'The Martian' is surprisingly accurate. Some are cosmetic, but the most important one, the storm that causes the film's events to take place, is something that can't physically happen. Scott's use of various wide and overhead shots does a great job emphasising Mark's isolation and loneliness. The visual effects on display throughout the film are impressive. The VFX department does an incredible job making sure the CGI used looks realistic and doesn't blatantly stand out to viewers. Despite being a futuristic sci-fi film, 'The Martian' incorporates themes that link to ideas of human nature and humanity's future. Man's natural desire to persevere and survive plays a key role in the film - If Mark didn't have this overwhelming hunger to survive he probably wouldn't have made it home; this directly links to themes of hope and possibility. One of the first times Mark addresses the audience, he directly says 'I'm Not Gonna Die Here'. The film asks the question of what future space travel will look like, and if we might actually have humans on mars sooner rather than later. The biggest theme, however, is isolation/separation and what effects prolonged isolation has on someone. The only thing that appears to keep Mark sane through the film seems to be his access to a video log, telling both the log and viewers, what he's thinking and planning. The psychological effect of this shows up when Mark is finally rescued by his team and instantly tears up at the thought of being with other people again. Even the production design carries across this theme; the crew's kit and equipment remind Mark that he's all alone, with nothing and no one. On the whole, 'The Martian' does a brilliant job making the viewers feel like they're with Mark. The production design, camera movements and performances all help the viewer feel as though they're in the scene with Mark. Overall, 'The Martian' is a superb film that showcases a sensational performance from its lead and features striking cinematography. Ridley Scott provides audiences with a movie that fans of off-planet adventures will enjoy for years to come.",The Martian,The Martian - Movie Reviews

Smart, thrilling, and surprisingly funny, ""The Martian ""offers a faithful adaptation of the bestselling book that brings out the best in leading man Matt Damon and director Ridley Scott. What's so fascinating about the film is that it truly turns on the solving of problems! The story goes by when astronauts blast off from the planet Mars, they leave behind Mark Watney (Matt Damon), presumed dead after a fierce storm. With only a meagre amount of supplies, the stranded visitor must utilise his wits and spirit to find a way to survive on the hostile planet. Meanwhile, back on Earth, members of NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring him home, while his crew mates hatch their own plan for a daring rescue mission. The storytelling techniques work well enough to keep the film engaging. Its a film about human error, the will to survive, and the responsibility that we have as human beings, not just to the work that we dedicate our lives to, but to one another as people. Despite being marketed under the mainstream bait of a ""space movie"". The acting and plot are great featuring the best work and the best performance I've ever seen from Matt Damon, and an outstanding supporting cast. The Martian is an extraordinary tale of Watney's extreme optimism, courage, determination and most importantly, ingenuity.

5574,Chris N,"Jun 12, 2021","The Martian is a genuinely fun movie, and if asked, I'd give it nine out of ten stars. The characters, primarily Matt Damon's Mark Watney, are charming and fun to watch, which honestly makes the whole movie work. The beginning is strong. Everything on Mars is hectic, until it isn't and Mark Watney is stranded on Mars. The narrative takes time with Watney, the near silence from Watney and tense synth-y score really pulling the audience into Watney's head, almost uncomfortably close. Very intimate. It sets up… not stakes, exactly, but the seriousness of the movie. Later, Watney will joke around accompanied by cheesy 70's music, but in the beginning, the movie grounds itself, letting the more serious moments later also finding their place alongside the sillier ones. Matt Damon really nails Mark Watney, making him likable with depth in a way that makes me forgive how little character development takes place. With all the talent, gravitas, and charm the other actors bring, the acting is one of the strongest parts of the movie. You can't help but root for Watney to get saved, for his crew to come rescue him, for everything to go right back on Earth. The narrative does them all favors too, because even though you're sure he'll be saved and everything will be alright, all that goes wrong keeps making you wonder, ""What if?"" Even if that's not a question in your mind, it's immensely entertaining to see Watney get from Point A to Point B. The script is clever in this respect, and while I don't know if the science was correct, the movie impresses upon its audience complicated science without making it feel too easy or too difficult to understand. The lighthearted moments are definitely one of the biggest draws of the movie. Just as this movie is rooted in serious stakes and dangerous situations, it has little jokes or bright music to uplift it. The movie treads a careful balance without the humor seeming forced or the tenseness dragging everything down. It succeeds, for sure. The suspense feels more real when broken up by those little fun moments, and the little fun moments make the movie all the more watchable. Overall, this is an absolute blast of a movie, and I would recommend it if you're into fun sci-fi!",The Martian,The Martian - Movie Reviews

5594,Jack M,"Feb 02, 2021","Ridley Scott this time has adapted Andy Weir's best-selling novel of the same name. Which detailed a stranded astronaut's story to survive on Mars with the resources he has and botany skills to boot. Scripted by Drew Goddard of The Cabin in the Woods fame and starring Matt Damon in the central role of Mark Watney. All of this has come together to form one of Ridley Scott's best films for some time. Certainly at this point in time, his best film since American Gangster. The story goes that a space crew is stationed on Mars, there to explore the Acidalia Planitia plain as part of their expedition. A storm rages which prompts them to leave, but not before Mark Watney played by Matt Damon is struck by a piece of a satellite antenna and is presumed dead by the crew. NASA gets wind of this and has a memorial service in his name, believing him to be dead. Sure enough, Watney survives but is in the risk of losing air. Having managed to make it to to the base, he comes to the realisation that he is alone, with little food and contact with no-one. Therefore using a space log to update his activities, he plans to use his special botany skills and ingenuity to survive. To make contact in the hope that he can somehow escape and reunite with his crew and Earth itself. The film works on several levels. The cast themselves are part of an ensemble and all shine together in this film. From Matt Damon as our lead, a worn-down but cocky and confident individual, who you all root for to make it back home in the long run. To Jessica Chastain as the ship's commander Melissa Lewis, the authoritative and leading figure to her crew and all-out disco music fan. To Chiwetel Ejiofor as NASA's director of space missions who carries the burden on earth to bring Watney back safely. To Jeff Daniels director of NASA who is cautious and decisive to a fault, just to name a few. The film manages to be surprisingly funny even during the more sombre and dark moments. By no means is this film a comedy (as the Golden Globes believed it was…) nor is it out of place or sporadic. Which is a credit to Drew Goddard's script who possesses a successful track record of subtly blending drama and comedy together to significant effect. I think it is also a credit to Ridley Scott, who doesn't downplay or fight against the right tone for the film, but more flows with it. Sometimes a script and Scott's vision in the past would conflict disastrously – but here it's lighting in a bottle. The steps Watney takes to survive, whether growing potatoes in a confined space of dirt and faeces by using leftover rocket fuel to produce hydrogen or dismantling equipment and ship parts to make movement viable by the direction of NASA scientists; is fascinating to watch. Not just because the audience know what's at stake, but the level of humourous insight renders any steps into dreariness; making it an excellent but reflective thrill ride of a film. Just watching the movie blending all those successful elements together marks it as a triumphant rendition of the novel itself and offers surprises along the way. This is undoubtedly a film that isn't there to make a grand, ultimate statement. Nor is it trying to be a deep, experience film like in the vein of 2001: a Space Odyssey or Interstellar but is just only an entertaining, enjoyable survival story. That has its moments of reflection and more than enough time for the audience to spend time with Watney on his journey to survive and also be in the company of a great cast to boot. To the power of the botanist and film director, this is definitely one of his best outings and reaffirms Ridley Scott as one of cinema's greatest storytellers.",The Martian,The Martian - Movie Reviews
5595,Fabian S,6d ago,"It's got a pretty intriguing premise and a handful of pretty funny and entertaining scenes that live up to the said premise, but for the most part, this movie just totally squanders its potential and fails to live up to the premise at all.

5600,Nazer A,"Jul 09, 2021","A perfectly great and original superhero movie, that should have been R-rated, which was perfectly ruined by the studio. The masterful Vince Gilligan was at the helm of this movie for the first half, which is why the first half was so good but after ""creative differences"" he left halfway through production, which is why the second half of the movie is like a totally different movie altogether. It's a shame because Deadpool wasn't released until 8 years after Hancock, and that movie proved that a superhero movie could be R-rated and still have a huge box office! And has since then inspired many other superhero movies to be R-rated and which is why Marvel studios are now brave enough to make Deadpool 3 R-rated and include it in the MCU. Hancock could have been SO good, but the Sony said ""we want kids to watch it too for the extra money"" (paraphrasing here) and look where it got this movie. It was the waste of a potentially great movie!

They should have made two movies as this way it felt like two films strung together oddly into an incoherent whole.

5616,Hayden L,"Jun 19, 2020","If we're being honest, Hancock didn't pack much weight at all. Will Smith is the reason why this film didn't completely flop. From the start, I caught the notion that everyone behind the camera just didn't really care all that much; They basically let Will Smith, be Will Smith, and just carry the film with his stature. The narrative on it's own was a big issue. It had such a choppy pace and flow, being super fast paced, with little - to - no setup. The script by Vincent Ngo & Vince Gilligan was pretty funny, but lacked wit, and powerful dialogue scenes. If this film was more of Will Smith cracking tongue and cheek jokes, and fighting bad guys, it probably would've been better, being a harmless action/comedy. Jason Bateman & Charlize Theron did their best to compliment Smith, but the character developments they tried to display during the second act, wasn't all that good, or necessary. Theron was just a plot device until the third act, with her character becoming short lived. I was fond of Jae Head's performance, for what little meaning he had. For his first motion picture, he does very well, and seems to be a favorable young actor on the rise. The effects and action sequences were done pretty amateurishly, feeling too cartoonish, and sloppy. The didn't really showcase anything new, or eye catching, being the film's biggest disappointment.",Hancock,Hancock - Movie Reviews

The only issue that I have with this film was towards the end. When Hancock was about to die, the criminals mentioned how ""everyone has their time."" What great way to end a movie with that message. Of course, Americans likes good endings so Hancock didn't die and everything turned out fine. But I always wonder, how much different this movie could have been if the ending was different.

5653,Kyle C,"May 19, 2021","Although a lot of the build-up feels a little pointless at the end, this heist-style F&F film is a lot of fun, with solid special effects, pretty engaging characters, and (of course) some wild car stunts. Hobbs is a great addition to the cast, and Johnson really gives it his all with his sweat-drenched performance. It was also fun to see the ensemble highlights from the previous installments all together in one place, finally. I'm very much a fan of the film's poking fun at Han's inevitable trip to Tokyo, and I'm thankful that they're postponing it yet again, as his character proves to be a lot of fun in this film. My biggest complaint with this film, as I mentioned, is that the entire middle act is spent with the characters planning and practicing an elaborate heist. Unfortunately, everything falls apart so much at the end that 90% of the plan goes completely out the window. Don't get me wrong - the action-packed final sequence is a hell of a good time, but it does feel somewhat invalidating of all the really engaging technical challenges the team faced. I also felt that the film was overall lacking in, for lack of a better term, fast and furious scenes - they spend a lot of time talking, running, shooting, and punching, but not a lot of time actually driving cars (until the extended final chase sequence, of course). Despite this, I really enjoyed Fast Five.",Fast Five,Fast Five - Movie Reviews

At the moment I didn't know this movie was going to have an impact on my hobbies as I grow older. I watched this movie again with my friends when I went to college and after watching this movie for the second time, I was able to get a much deeper sense for the different aspects of this movie. This movie does a great job involving everything a boy would enjoy; which includes fast cars, action, and women. The superb cinematography in this movie really caught great scenes of fast cars and fight scenes. I remember as a kid I would be in awe watching the super cool cars speed by in street races and wanting to have a cool looking car like that one day too, and now almost ten years later I have grown up to own a mustang that did feature in this movie. Besides the action scenes, this movie also had a great soundtrack that went along with it. The quick tempo music went along perfectly with the action cuts in this movie to stir up excited emotions in the audience. All the characters in this movie are really likeable and overall a great cast. This movie along with the rest of the Fast and Furious series are all outstanding movies that do great in all aspects of film making.",Fast Five,Fast Five - Movie Reviews
5665,"Sep 25, 2020","I have often heard people say that The Fast and Furious franchise starts off a bit slow, but they get much more fun at Fast Five. So, I made the jump from the first one all the way to the fifth to see if people were right. I figure if this chapter in the saga doesn’t work for me then it’s clear that none of them are going to be my cup of tea. I will admit that it is more fun watching these guys as big-time international thieves than just a bunch of street-racing punks who steal DVD players. It’s always a blast to see the tropes of a heist movie as our heroes assemble their team, devise their plan, and then execute the plan (dealing with any bumps in the road as they go.) I didn’t feel like I missed much in character development by skipping some of the movies. I just accepted that this team had grown closer, and moved up in the world from petty larceny to the point that they are pulling massive heists in non-extradition countries. It also seemed fairly obvious that they expected us to like them all despite the fact that they were convicted criminals on the run from the law. Finally, I understood the sly references to Tokyo Drift, because I’ve heard many times before that it takes place after these films. I do like some of what they are trying to do with the franchise in Fast Five, but I struggle with it as well because it feels like they are taking everything so seriously. This doesn’t feel like a fantasy world, and yet these men and women are superhuman. They can survive anything, they never get shot, and we even watch Vin Diesel break a pair of metal restraints with nothing but brute strength. Also, I’m not a car guy, so all the time spent drooling over luxury sports cars and watching them race in circles was kind of dull for me. Plus, these aren’t even real cars because they have supernatural powers just like their drivers. The big chase at the end is one of those things that is meant to be pure fun, but I was sitting there baffled that this made any logical sense. A fleet of semis couldn’t pull that much weight at those speeds, let alone a couple of cars. Not to mention all the civilians that must have been killed by that huge thing swinging around as they raced down the street. So much for the family being good guys, they are mass murderers!

It is way better than the second one in the original trilogy and recaptures much of the magic of the original. Josh Brolin does a terrific Tommy Lee Jones impression and Will Smith is at his Will Smithiest. I love the 60s in general and find it to be a fantastic setting, even if it's terribly underused in this movie. Likewise I'm generally a sucker for the time travel conceit and while they could have done more with it, it might actually be an even better premise than in the other 2 movies. Jemaine Clement also made for an interesting villain in Boris the animal, although again, this movie squandered him, the era, and the time travel to a degree but remains satisfactory nonetheless, despite all its predictability. The one particular note that I felt was forced was the twist where we discover something that not only is statistically improbable to the point of absurdity but just feels shoehorned in due to some executive's insistence or some poor decision on the writer's part. The time travel also makes no logical sense whatsoever, but, if you go into it with just popcorn movie expectations, then it delivers.",Men in Black 3,Men in Black 3 - Movie Reviews

5733,Nathan D,"Sep 05, 2021","The movie is too crowded, and that is the main problem. The script is poorly written and creates an unfocused, messy film. The ""government vs. Tony Stark"" plot is intriguing and was a sophisticated plot point to explore in the first act. However, it loses itself in the 3rd act when none of it gets mentioned again. The villain of the movie is also terrible. Ivan Vanko does absolutely nothing in this film. His motives are unclear for the first hour of the movie, and there is hardly any explanation for anything he does. Justin Hammer, who also fits the villain trope, is also poorly written. A video of him almost killing someone leaks, and everyone still loves him at the end of the movie? It's just terrible writing. Trusting Justin Theroux with a story like this still makes no sense today. Theroux butchered so many characters making them feel unlikeable. For example, Tony is literally in a relationship with Pepper, but he shows interest in Natasha and other females. Yes, Tony is one to be the flirty type, but character growth is essential. No character grows in the film making for a pointless story. The only good part of the script would be the Howard Stark plot point. It brought a lot of heart to the movie and made the film watchable. Other than the script issues, everything else in the film was mediocre. The cinematography did not feel as visually stunning as the first installment. There were only a few shots that looked appealing. The production and set design also felt weak. Most of the movie takes place either in an office building or Stark's house. That does tie back into the script because there was no innovation in where the characters would be. However, that does not excuse the production and set design teams as they did not elevate those locations to make it stand out. Jon Favreau does a so-so job directing Iron Man 2, and it was nowhere near as good as Iron Man. What Favreau did on Iron Man was spectacular. In this installment, everything felt generic with no real suspense or emotion. The action sequences were one of the worst parts of the film as they had no thrill or uneasiness whatsoever. Jon Favreau was able to create that sense of fear whenever danger was around Iron Man. Yet here, it is like Tony can get out of any situation without any problems. The tone Favreau created for this movie was just not at the level it should have been. The cast was the only good part of Iron Man 2. Robert Downey Jr. is superb as always and does not disappoint even with a butchered character arc. Downey knows how to play cocky so well. Gwyneth Paltrow also does a lot better in this film than in the first installment. Paltrow's performance is watchable and made me like Pepper more as a character. Don Cheadle also does a great job in the role of James Rhode. He brought a lot more emotion to Rhodes' personality, which allowed for a better connection to him. Sam Rockwell is so unlikeable in this film. That is great since his character is supposed to be unlikeable. Lastly, Mickey Rourke is a mixed bag as, with such a terrible character arc, his performance can not save it. Overall, Iron Man 2 is a deeply flawed film that can never stick the landing in almost all of the departments of the film. Justin Theroux ruined this movie with his awful writing as he handled these principal characters in such a disappointing way. Everything else is also a step-down as only the cast can start the thrusters in this version of Iron Man. Read more reviews like this at postcreditreviews.com",Iron Man 2,Iron Man 2 - Movie Reviews

The film loses much of the finesse that the first one had, and manages to squander Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke. Whiplash shouldn't have been this movie's villain; it would've been more entertaining to watch Tony spend two hours fighting the government for control over his tech, and the writers would probably still have found some way to get Natasha into the story. At least that way it would've made more sense as a sequel to Iron Man. The big actors, both new and familiar faces, do their best in their roles, and some of the fights are entertaining to watch, but all of that isn't enough to keep this sequel afloat.

5756,Dale R,"Nov 14, 2021","One of Pixar's best movies! Remy, a rat, is an aspiring chef and finds a way to realize his dream in Paris. As with every film, Pixar ups the game in animation. The water, fire effects are great as is the movement of the rat characters. The human characters are stylized, but believable in a cartoonish way. Brad Bird does an amazing job as director/writer and crafts an excellent story. Patton Oswalt is great as Remy and Peter O'Toole is a perfect cast as Anton Ego. The writing is also well done, Ego's review near the end of the movie is a highlight. An amazing film, go see it!",Ratatouille,Ratatouille - Movie Reviews

But the issue is that there are other Pixar films that are conceptually and emotionally better. Again….if we are going on what Pixar film is probably the best made one, it's a toss up between Monsters Inc and The Incredibles for me. Yeah, I'm just stalling on this review. I could be here for days talking about the themes alone, but there's a YouTube video that already describe everything this film did right. If you can, watch ""Why Ratatouille is Pixar's Magnum Opus"" by Schaffrillas Productions. He explains why it is the best Pixar movie Better than I ever could. My only thing is that this movie falls under the same category as Finding Nemo for me. Has a few better moments then some of the 5 out of 5 Pixar movies (Anton Ego anyone?), but there's not a huge emotional moment, and the movie constantly tries to bring Chef Skinner back, which seems like kind of lazy writing. Also there's a stereotypical betrayal which is so dumb, but it's ""technically"" needed. Besides that, some parts of this movie feel like an Indy film. Again, watch the Schaffrillas Productions video, he goes into so much more detail than I do. Wanna watch arguably the best Pixar has to offer! Watch this well cooked movie on Disney+ and see for yourself!",Ratatouille,Ratatouille - Movie Reviews
5790,Jerry S,"Jun 19, 2021","Ratatouille was actually a pretty interesting movie. I had a lot of fun while watching it. Yes it may not be the most memorable Pixar movie but it is interesting. So it's about a Rat named Remy who dreams of becoming a chef at a famous restaurant in Paris. However the only problem with that though is that he's a Rat. However he does eventually ends up in this famous restaurant in Paris after he parts away from his family. However he realize he could have his dream come true when he meets a human named Linguini and helps him out cooking delicious meals while no one knowing the truth on who's the real cook. To be honest with you I actually thought that this movie had really interesting premise. That they actually used really well also they really handled the animation on the food really well and the story it's self was a pretty interesting. However the one problem that I have with the movie is that it's really not that memorable. Sure the characters are likable and well animated but they aren't as memorable as Woody, Buzz m, Nemo, Marlin, Dory, etc. Another thing about this movie is that I feel like the pacing could've been better. Ratatouille is not one of Pixar's best movies but it does keep you interested in both the characters and the animation, so while it might not be as memorable, it does put a good taste in my mouth. 8/10",Ratatouille,Ratatouille - Movie Reviews

During the lockdown, however, I wanted to find several animated films that I had not seen, including this saga. When I saw the first one I was amazed by its beauty (you will also find my review). But the second managed, I don't know how, to do much better. This sequel cleverly continues the first film setting it years later when Hiccup and Toothless are now grown up. The tone of this film, generally speaking, is dark, like Toy Story 3. And I really like animated films with dark tones. The relationship between the two protagonists undergoes a notable evolution which becomes very mature. The villain is one of my favorites at Dreamworks: he is very evil. I liked one of his scenes in particular, as well as one of the most moving: when Drago takes control thanks to his Toothless alpha and goes so that he kills Hiccup. The father, however, saves the blow and dies. Moreover, although he had always traveled by ship, on that occasion he rides Toothless to make Hiccup feel even worse. The twists are not lacking and they are unpredictable. The animations are spectacular and gorgeous to look at. The characters are all nice and well developed. The film is simply fantastic: a masterpiece for sure. With a well thought-out storyline and great characters, How to Train Your Dragon 2 is absolutely a movie worth watching.",How to Train Your Dragon 2,How to Train Your Dragon 2 - Movie Reviews

The animation has greatly improved and looks stunning, the soundtrack is just as spine-chilling, the first 10 minutes do a great job in establishing how Berk has changed in the last 5 years, Stoick's death was incredibly dark and emotional, especially since he sacrificed himself for Hiccup, I love his interactions with Valka and that song and their reunion are some of the best scenes in the trilogy, the universe gets expanded with the introduction to the Alpha dragon and it takes a darker tone and develops the character and themes pretty well. I have some issues however with the characters. Valka is just forgotten in the 3rd act and I feel like her coming back to Berk should have been impactful, Drago just stands around and yells and is just forgettable, the teenage vikings are so unfunny and annoying, Astrid is kind of out of character with her being reckless and her and the teenage vikings don't receive any consequences for them leading Drago and his army to where Hiccup as it was their fault. Even Toothless is just a side character until the 3rd act.

The acting is superb, and Hugh Jackman gives his best portrayal of Wolverine to ever hit the screen. The entire film is very emotional, and constantly tries to jerk a tear out of your eyes. The ending is bitter-sweet, yet it leaves the audience oddly satisfied as it feels like the perfect conclusion to a franchise that has been going on sine the original ""X-Men."" As serious as this film does get, however, there is still loads of chemistry and jokes between the three main characters (Logan, Charles Xavier, and Laura), and the movie never becomes too serious to the point of boredom. The only real issue I have with ""Logan"" is that the villain is somewhat forgettable, however, the movie is still enjoyable (albeit brutal) to watch, and it is entirely targeted towards an older audience, which I thought opened up this movie from the limitations it otherwise would have had.",Logan,Logan - Movie Reviews

Hugh Jackman killed it in this role as Wolverine like we've never seen him. His sadness, his lashing out, his distrust of other people, all combine to make a stellar performance. Patrick Stewart was absolutely heartbreaking to watch as our beloved Professor X is weak and slowly dying. And the breakout performance of Dafne Keen was thrilling to watch. She barely speaks in the movie but her body language and facial expressions took that character to another level.",Logan,Logan - Movie Reviews

They tend to be trite and formulaic, with no heart and no originality, high on action low on genuine emotion; and even less actually have well crafted dialogue. But I'm a huge fan of Logan. It's got all of this and more. It's the emotional core that makes it special though, with exceptional heart, well done script, and meaningful dialogue. And an incredible, believable performance by its three leads. It actually reminds me of Rocky and The Unforgiven more than a superhero film, in that it shows the flawed, yet beautiful, humanity at the core of every underdog; merely through the cracked lens of being ""super"".

That isn't to say this movie isn't flawless, characters are a mixed bag the protagonists Sarah and nick do more harm than good Roland tembo the great white hunter is a big highlight the dude singlehandedly took down a T.rex gotta give him props for that my biggest issue is without a doubt a T.rex rampaging through San Diego at the end wayyy too Godzilla Esque or as Ian Malcolm would say ""the worst idea in the long sad history of bad ideas"" ;) if you like dinosaurs and like Jurassic then what are you waiting for",The Lost World: Jurassic Park,The Lost World: Jurassic Park - Movie Reviews

The characters are rushed, we do not feel connected at all to any of them, the storyline is mediocre and rapidly deteriorates. Even if the greenpeace dude was anti-human, it feels forced how he deliberately attempts to endanger the bad guys (opens cages, unloads guns), but someone needs to forward the plot I guess. While in the first, human life was spent sparingly, here it's just fun and games. Would have liked to learn more about the 'don't go in the high grass guy' seeing as it seems like he is important to the bald dude, but no. Whilst the woman scientist was excellent in the first movie (reliable and smart), in this movie this one is just a pain in the ass, useless and unable to have any sense of self-survival, but all this is excused to make the plot move forward. By the end you are just fed up and even the fun scene with the T-rex isn't enough to get you back into it, especially since they added huge plot holes at the end.

5899,Will C,"Jun 06, 2021","I'll probably be crucified for saying this, but this is my favourite Jurassic Park film. More Goldblum and more dinosaurs is the perfect equation for excellence. The film definitely suffers from being in the shadow of the original which is objectively superior as well as being one of the most iconic science fiction films of all time. The film also definitely has its flaws (the velociraptor gymnastics scene and T. rex rampage come to mind) but makes up for it with some fantastic atmosphere, musical score (John Williams takes it up a notch with the music here, which has so much more individual personality) and an overall tone that is darker than the original.

5901,Birithivy Y,"May 18, 2021","The Lost World Jurassic Park - 9/10. Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. He's a director with a vision that was well ahead of his time. In terms of sequels and the way they are presented, I feel like Spielberg was a pioneer in terms of making sequels with a darker aesthetic and mood. Films like Temple Of Doom and The Lost World went down darker paths than the first instalments in their series (Raiders Of The Lost Ark and Jurassic Park respectively). In terms of The Lost World, I think it was the best decision to go down a more darker tone. The cinematography done by Janusz Kaminski is superb. The way he shoots the action scenes and uses shadows and the night almost like a separate character makes this film such a visual treat. Jurassic Park featured some amazing cinematography, but I feel like The Lost World is much stronger in terms of the visual tone it presents. People seem to have liked this film a little more as time has gone by. I've always loved it and it was one of my #childhood favourites. Jurassic Park is definitely the best in the series, but The Lost World comes in a close second. There are more dinos (3 Trex!), Jeff Goldblum is promoted to being the lead (Ian Malcolm is one of my all time favourite characters) and John Williams delivers an amazing score. Its such a fun filled ride, and quite horror-esque (something that I feel movies like this should attempt to be like!). The movie never fails to entertain, and just feels like it ages extremely well for an action adventure film. I feel like the reason why it's considered underrated is because its the sequel to one of the greatest films ever made. Its a tall task to follow, but I think it does a great job! If somehow, you've never seen this movie, go watch it!",The Lost World: Jurassic Park,The Lost World: Jurassic Park - Movie Reviews

It just reaffirms the message of the first movie. It doesn't stand out in any way.",The Lost World: Jurassic Park,The Lost World: Jurassic Park - Movie Reviews
5905,Meydiana R,"Apr 04, 2021","Excellent Sequel Creating a worthy follow-up to a major blockbuster is no easy task. But if all the pieces are in the right place, it is not impossible. Four years after the enormous success of Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg took control of the director's chair once more in an effort to enhance the franchise and add on to his already spectacular legacy. Did he succeed? In the eyes of most critics, no. However, I applaud Mr. Spielberg for an admirable effort and creating another crowd-pleaser, even if it didn't match up to the high expectations. On another personal note, I was very happy to see Jeff Goldblum reprise his role as Dr. Ian Malcolm as he has always been my favorite character in the series. Since Malcolm is now more aware of the dangers of John Hammond's activities, his personality is less goofy and more serious this time around compared to his previous adventure. It took several viewings for me to appreciate this film to its fullest. At first, it seemed weak because it sacrificed the philosophical messages that helped make the first film great to fit in more action. The philosophy is found in one of the key quotes by John Hammond. ""Life will find a way."" There *is* a point to all the chaos because it is all caused by the humans and their relentless desire to interfere with nature. Every tragic event seen in the film could have been avoided with sensibility and that is the message that is echoed throughout the entire series. Don't attempt to control the uncontrollable. If there's one thing that makes the film worth watching, it has to be the special effects and the dinosaur animatronics. The infant T-Rex featured in this film is so lifelike that I often had to remind myself that it wasn't a real dinosaur. It was *that* convincing. Also be on the lookout for Vince Vaughn (before he became the mega-star that he is today) as one of Hammond's researchers and a humorous scene involving a T-Rex in the modern world.",The Lost World: Jurassic Park,The Lost World: Jurassic Park - Movie Reviews

Maybe because everyone, including the critics are comparing it to one of the greatest movies ever made in the original Jurassic Park but if this were a stand alone movie, the reviews and admiration would be much higher. I think this movie deserves at least an 80% rating. The technology used both for CGI and the vehicles and equipment the actors used on screen were way ahead of its time, considering this was produced in the mid 90's. This movie scared the shit outta me when I was a kid, as did the first one, and if you were to show this to a young kid nowadays it would hold up. If the original film is the best out of the franchise, then this one is the second best, and the third one the third best. The 2 most recent Jurassic Parks are absolutely terrible imo, they turned a legitimately scary idea and series of films into family friendly BS. The Lost World is when raptors were one of the main antagonists of the movie instead of Chris Pratt's golden retriever.

5927,Thomas R,"Nov 10, 2021","The original James Bond series as created by Ian Fleming feature a spy who lives the high life as he does his spy work, killing a few evildoers and making love to several women in the process. There were some gadgets, though not necessarily flashy ones, and Bond wasn't always full of wisecracks like he would be in the later movies. The idea might have been that the later movies were too full of wisecracks and fancy gadgets and they were toning it down. But they ended up overdoing it and turning Bond into basically a glorified serial killer. The older movies did have Bond do killing and blowing up of villains' installations. But in this movie, Bond kills willy-nilly, often without real necessity. On top of that, the scenes at the gambling table and his romance with the (supposed) heroine go on for too long. Bond may be young and inexperienced, but no wisecracks at all? We might as well be watching a ""Bourne"" movie.",Casino Royale,Casino Royale - Movie Reviews

This may borrow certainly from the Bourne movies, but it improves upon them and writing wise, it adapts from the book (Casino Royale) faithfully. This is one of the more serious entries and I absolutely love that. The action is shot coherently and the shots are held just long enough for us to see what is happening. The set pieces themselves are among the best in the franchise and this one film has a few of them. They are all great. Daniel Craig is fantastic in the role. Not my favourite bond, not even in my top 3, but he's still really good. All of the official actors that played the character brought something to the role that none of the other do quite as well. Craig has the best run. He just does. I hadn't notice before, and thought he only started doing this in his later films, but he mutters here. It is a negative, I am unable to sometimes make out what he was saying if not for watching with subtitles. Vesper is a fantastic Bond girl, but if there were any negatives I have for this otherwise masterpiece it is that Bond falling for her felt a bit forced. Not too forced, in the end, it still is believable, I just needed a bit more time with them together is all for it to fully 100% connect with me.",Casino Royale,Casino Royale - Movie Reviews

5940,Jonathan K,"Oct 15, 2021","Casino Royale is a 4-star 100 minute movie stretched out to a painfully long 160 minutes, and that's a shame. The story is pretty good, the villains, while not memorable, are certainly intimidating, the action scenes are solid and the movie's technical merits are quite good. While it certainly got tiresome after a while, Craig's more realistic and Anti-Fun Loving take on Bond certainly helps make this movie feel like an entirely different beast than those from before, and one that you could genuinely take seriously. Craig's performance is a strong dramatic one, and he does have the gravitas required to carry a movie with this dark and aggressive of a tone. The main problem with the movie is that it just feels endless; I remember watching this in numerous 30 minute chunks and even then I was feeling the weight of it. If you like a more serious tone with your Action movie, then Casino Royale is certainly going to deliver - it's not as ambitious as Batman Begins, the movie that it clearly took inspiration from (that being the ""Gritty Reboot"" of a franchise), but it's certainly good at what it does, for the most part.",Casino Royale,Casino Royale - Movie Reviews

This Bond is human (he hurts, he bleeds, he loves, and he has chosen to live the life of an assassin to serve his country. Nothing comes before duty for this 007. Unlike many of the out of shape, or average physique Bonds of the past, Craig's Bond looks and captures the physicality of a man that can kill with his bare hands. The movie's opening let's you know that this 007 is ice cold, as he becomes a 007. The pacing is perfect, the best poker game in cinema history, and a love story that will engross and capture the audiences emotion. Action set pieces are among the best (and are the best imo).

A role Jim Caviezel was born to play. It is rated R for a reason but the violence was simply trying to accomplish an accurate portrayal of the torture and crucifixion.

5993,Daniel B,"Feb 18, 2021","This by far is the best movie that there is in the history of cinema. I read the critic reviews and cannot believe there lack of depth. This is what a historical Roman execution would have looked like. Scourging itself killed most people. Jesus endured a Roman scourging then a Roman execution which is by far one of the most tortious ways to die ever envisioned by men. Gibson's use of flashbacks is unbelievable and his subtle theology is just brilliant. As an example - the opening scene in the Garden of Gethsemane is with a serpent and the devil tempting Jesus. This is a call back to Genesis and the Garden of Eden. Adam was tempted by the serpent and fell. Jesus as the new Adam is also tempted by the Serpent in a Garden except He does not fail the test He literally ""crushes the serpents head"". While this is not in the bible - this is making the theological point that Jesus fulfils the prophesy of Genesis 3:15 and by the very scenes in the movie which portray His passion and death He crushes the head of the serpent in the spiritual reality. The acting in the film is breathtaking. Considering that Jim Caviezel literally almost died several times in the filming of the movie and was in tremendous physical pain while on the cross his acting was not so much acting but actual agony. The score moves the audience to tears every time you watch this movie even for the millionth time. This movie is one you watch, buy and share.

6011,Andrew A,"Jun 04, 2021","It's well done. It's visually appealing. The CGI is decent. And there's some depth here. I can't really decide if the movie is arguing in favor of spirituality/religion or against it. Maybe it's neither. The whole point is that Pi made up the story with the animals so that he could live with the memories of what he had to do to survive, killing, cannibalism, etc. The tiger never really tried to eat Pi because he is Pi. Pi didn't like that his more primitive side had to come out to survive but he also knew he couldn't abandon the tiger as it was part of him and they needed each other. And people do this all the time. We remember uncomfortable things in a brighter light than the reality. We excuse ourselves from facing our own demons by making up a metaphorical tiger and acting like it was something separate from ourselves when we really understand, on a completely honest, rational level that it was us, but we don't want to embrace that truth. I'm also not so sure about the island. I guess it represents his thoughts of giving up hope of rejoining the world. He could stay there and die alone but he decided that's not what he wanted to do. He wanted to keep moving on and trying to find people again or die trying. And he viewed it as a sign from god that he needed to find the island to realize it wasn't his time to just give up and die. And this is why his tiger side had to leave the island with him. This part makes me think the tone of the film is pro-spirituality/religion, even though it recognizes it's not rational. The larger idea here is that religion is basically a coping device that people use to adopt a brighter perspective on the harsh realities that we have no evidence suggesting we are of any significance or anything more than an accident. I think atheists, and even some theists already realize this. So this isn't some revolutionary idea. And the movie dragged a bit in some places. But it is well done and worth seeing at least once.",Life of Pi,Life of Pi - Movie Reviews

This film is about a boy who ran away from home, who got into a difficult situation and ended up alone in the middle of the sea, along with a tiger. In this film, we were shown that there are no hopeless situations. You need to go to your goal and take all the difficulties as a test.

I felt surprisingly little for the main character and his family, which goes to show how the writers failed. In fact, I was far more concerned about the animals. Some of the visual effects were excellent, whereas others were as fake as Don Cheadle's English accent. CGI was definitely overused, but the cinematography and soundtrack were decent.

6025,Andy S,"Feb 08, 2021","It's weird, I can tell which animals are real and which are CGI. I'm not really digging that. And the CGI looks kind of dated. The unnecessary animal CGI is really throwing me off. I love how the two actors that were in the movie The Namesake are in this movie as well. It's cool to see how interested Pi was in the different religions. Very smart too being able to write the entire numerology of pi, 3.14 etc. That whole ship scene and him going overboard with the little boat into those humongous waves gave me crazy anxiety. Some of the scenes were very unrealistic which made everything seem very much fiction, which I guess this whole story is. That carnivorous island part was really interesting. The way the island was shaped like a human being that was laying down. The island was alive, like a breathing organism. The whole relationship between him and the tiger was interesting. All the hardships they went through. And that whole thing about the tiger not looking back to say goodbye before he went into the jungle, that stuck with me. It's kind of like not being able to say goodbye to the ones you loved or had some kind of meaningful relationship with. Philosophical in nature. This is a movie about faith, religion and the greater power of god. It's about love and pain. Very beautiful nature landscape imagery. Trippy and magical at times like the scene with all the jellyfish and the humpback whale. Even though the whole movie is practically CGI and looks pretty dated, it is an incredible feat what Ang Lee was able to pull off.",Life of Pi,Life of Pi - Movie Reviews

6032,Kaitlyn B,"Sep 26, 2020","SPOILER ALERT! Summary: The movie starts in Canada where a Canadian writer visits an Indian boy named Piscine Patel, also known as Pi, and asks him to tell his epic survival story. The story begins in Pondicherry, India, where Pi's parents own a small family zoo. Pi is raised practicing Hinduism. Later in his life, he is introduced to Christianity and then Islam, and he starts to follow all three religions as ""all he wants is to love God"", no matter how he does it. When Pi is a teenager, his dad decides to sell the zoo and move to Canada. They go on a sea voyage with the animals that they are going to sell in Canada. One night, a heavy storm happens, and the ship begins to sink. He tries to find his family, but he gets thrown into a lifeboat by a crew member. The next morning, he finds himself in the boat with an injured zebra, a hyena, an orangutan named Orange Juice, and a Bengal tiger, hiding beneath the canvas of the boat, named Richard Parker. After some time, the hyena kills and eats the zebra and then Orange Juice. Finally, Richard Parker kills and eats the hyena. Pi is left on the boat alone with the Bengal tiger. Pi finds emergency food, water, a whistle, and a handbook for surviving at sea in the lifeboat. With all these supplies, Pi builds a floating device and attaches it to the boat so that he can keep a safe distance from the tiger. He then realizes that he must tame the tiger, or the tiger will eventually eat him. He blows the whistle and rocks the lifeboat enough to make the tiger seasick. Even though he cannot fully train him, he is able to make the tiger subdued by blowing the whistle. After crashing into a breaching whale, Pi loses almost all of his supplies. Due to starvation, Pi starts eating raw fish, even though he is vegetarian. After a few months at sea, both Pi and Richard Parker barely have any strengths. They find a weird floating island full of edible plants and freshwater. But soon, Pi discovers that the island is carnivorous. At night, the island emits acid and consumes everything on it. Pi also finds a human tooth inside of a plant. Then he stocks the lifeboat with supplies and leaves the island with Richard Parker. Eventually they reach the beach of Mexico. Richard Parker runs into the jungle and stops at the edge of the jungle. Pi hopes that the tiger will look back and acknowledge him, but he doesn't. Pi is brought to a local hospital. There, he is interviewed by two Japanese officials. He tells them this story which they find unbelievable to report. Pi then tells them a similar but much darker story. In this story, everything is the same except for one part. He shares the boat with his own mother, Gita, a sailor with a broken leg, and the ship's cook. After some time, they are worried about the limited supplies in the lifeboat, the cook kills the sailor and then Gita. Pi then kills the cook for self-defense purpose. Analysis: This movie talks about the fight to survive. As mentioned before, Pi believes all three religions. He has developed kindness towards all things and has learned morality from these religions. But when facing death and starvation, Pi has to abandon his own morality to survive. Animals in the first story all have a corresponding human character in the second story: Gita is the orangutan, the sailor is the zebra, the cook is the hyena, and the tiger is a projection of Pi himself. And I believe this illusion created by him actually helps him to survive the endless sea voyage after knowing that he has committed a horrible act, which is against his personal morals but is natural for tigers, without losing his sense of humanity. And seeing people as animals is much easier under those circumstances. Critique/Recommendation: The actor Suraj Sharma gives a marvelous performance in this movie. And director Lee did a great job on visual effects. It also leaves us a question: which story do you prefer? Are you a person that believes in things that make sense? Or are you a person that believes in miracles? You can have different interpretations of what ""really"" happened, and there is no right or wrong answer. I really enjoyed this movie and would definitely recommend this movie and I'll give it a 4.5 out of 5 stars.",Life of Pi,Life of Pi - Movie Reviews

6050,Puroo R,"Aug 08, 2021","After the disappointment that Age of Extinction was, my hopes from this franchise had fallen to zero. However, I still had one ray of hope - it couldn't be worse than that, right? The story is already bad, the characters are no longer interesting, the continuity doesn't matter anymore, and hey, just one more movie is left after which I'll get to watch the super-awesome Bumblebee, so let's just tolerate one more movie. And boy, was I wrong when I didn't take one more factor into account: At least the cinematography was good in all the previous movies. Here even that fails. The most distracting thing in this entire movie is the continuously changing aspect ratio. There's a very important rule in filmmaking, that your jump cuts should be so seamless that the audience shouldn't realise when the jump cut takes place. Look at Marvel movies. When Black Widow fights there are like a gazillion jump cuts in just one somersault. If that is supposed to be silently moving across the room, the jump cuts of The Last Knight are like dragging an almirah across the room hoping no one would notice. You can literally see the jump cuts happen! And speaking of jump cuts ruining the mood, whenever the jump cuts happen in the same scene it feels like it is a completely different scene. Like in the scene where they are in the elevator and they see the butler bot over there, it feels as if the scene outside the elevator is a completely different place. The lighting is also so bad, it doesn't even feel like there's continuity until the jump cut happens again and the camera goes back to Cade and company. Apart from that there is also a scene where Cade stops his car in front of the sheriff and when he's stopping the car there's a lot of dust. But when the jump cut happens the dust is all gone. And while he's still stopping his car his voice starts coming. Like, he isn't even moving his mouth and the words are coming out louder than the car's engine. Another time the ADR ruins the mood is when the butler bot is playing the piano when the story of the Transformers is being narrated. He is asked to stop playing... Twice! A bad joke is repeated twice in just fifteen seconds! Then of course there's the fight between Optimus Prime and Bumblebee, the legendary fight for which everyone came to watch it. Because the movie had been advertised by saying that Optimus Prime is the bad guy in this movie. And guess how their fight ends? Martha! No, not by saying those exact words, but something similar. Just as Optimus is about to stab Bumblebee, he says, ""I'm Bumblebee. I'll lay my life before you!"" And that changes Optimus Prime's mood. First of all, why did it change his mood? He's a robot not a human. Emotions can't alter his programming. And secondly how on earth did Bumblebee suddenly start speaking? It's not like his voice suddenly fixed. It was permanently damaged. It's kinda weird that in this movie the humans are not the bad part. In fact I really liked its starting, where they were showing Merlin take help from the dragon Transformer to win the battle. I also liked how those kids were collecting spare parts to survive. Even showing Optimus Prime on his planet looked so cool. The way it began I was really wondering why on earth this movie has such bad reviews. If the movie focused on either of the two things it could have been a great movie. I really wanted to like it, but the jump cuts were making me laugh even on the serious scenes. I'm sorry, Michael Bay. But I think you've ruined a good movie by hiring a bad cinematographer.",Transformers: The Last Knight,Transformers: The Last Knight - Movie Reviews

6080,Jakob H,"Nov 01, 2020","The critics went out of their league to criticize this movie. But they fail to see this movie for what it is. A thoroughly entertaining and funny experience with absolute Bayhem! You can't analyze and think too hard on what you see. This is meant to be two and a half hour with amazing special effects, epic music and ridicolous moments. This movie looks so grand and epic on the big screen in cinema, thanks to Bay filming it almost entirely with IMAX 3-D cameras. After an very intriguing prologue set in medieval times with catapults casting fireballs and big armys clashing together in ""Gladiator"" style, we also see Stanley Tucci as drunk Merlin pleading with transformer knights. The crazy tone is set after the first 5 minutes. The movie is like the previous ones, hyperactive and fast paced. There are explosions and fighting, and very few quite character moments. But the few that are work well, especially the ""father-daughter"" set-up with Cade Yeager and Izabella. They have tough love but strong chemistry, and I wish we would see more of them together and more of Izabella, because she was the best actor in this movie. All the other well-known actors seem to know they are in a Transformers movie. They don't take it too seriously, it is all about acting over-the-top and bonkers. The ones that do that best is Anthony Hopkins with his hilarious robot butler ""Cogman"". I think simply they're presence made this movie the funniest out of the 5. The plot is very bloated and stuffed, altough the story is generic and similiar to the previous ones. It is all about finding Merlin's staff, that in Quintessa's hands will rebuild Cybertron and destroy Earth. Earth who is revealed to be Unicron, the ancient enemy of Cybertron. The talisman that Cade gets from a dying knight will lead to the staff. And cybertron is approaching earth rapidly, while also Megatron collaborates with the ""TRF"" who is the new rogue military force. And I haven't mentioned that Optimus Prime gets brainwashed by Quintessa and turns bad. So I could see why this is too much for someone, it was clearly an answer to ""too much of everything"" from the writer's room. But it worked for me. The middle act in London is the most crazy and ludicrous. The final act is an massive showdown of earth shattering preposterousness. An workable ending for the Bayformers, but then we get the stupid cliffhanger which should have been cut out. Personally I would've liked a more grounded movie with less subplots, who is more focused. We could follow the kids we meet at the beginning instead of Viviane and Cade troughout the movie and I would have liked more of Nemesis Prime. This movie clearly had a lot of talent and merits behind the screen, and although the movie is pretty forgettable and hated by many, I still found it to be worth watching. It captured a sense of escapism and if you want to experience a big-budget massive summer blockbuster that also is fun, this is the movie for you.

6085,Nicholas D,"Aug 20, 2020","you know you touched rock bottom when you willingly watch transformers 5. what a piece of garbage -Dialogue as if the writers hadn't talk to a kid in their life (or another human being for that matter) -aspect ratio changing EVERY SINGLE SHOT, not every scene; EVERY. SHOT. -camera movements without reason -cuts and framing that would be nice if it was a PARODY of an action movie and that would make anyone with eyes cringe. -random vignetting like they don't know how to use a fucking lens -no character development... no characters at all... -no reasoning behind the character's actions -awful pathetic attempts of ""comedy"" -lines that you can feel the actors hurt while delivering them... but on the bright side, if you don't understand what ""having a motive"" for everything in your scenes mean, every frame of this 2 hours and a half ""film"" is a perfect example of what not to do. the spectacle is the same as always and the only reason its not just half a star, a few things have improved since the previous ones which is not saying much, and the sexualisation of characters, even when it hasn't disappeared, its less prominent in this one. it is a scream of glory for the vfx artists but nothing beyond that, and i have to clarify that some scenes keep being nonsensical visual noise, and shortcuts in the transforming part of a movie called transformers leaves some things to desire in that area too, but some effect filled scenes were actually interesting.",Transformers: The Last Knight,Transformers: The Last Knight - Movie Reviews

6118,Shaun B,"Mar 11, 2019","Madagascar Escape 2 Africa is the follow up from its predecessor Madagascar and it doesn't quite it that mark. The film is very funny and the plot is fast paced but it just isn't as good as the brilliant original. The film contains great casting choices made by Leslee Feldman which stays the same as the first and has Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, Jada Pinkett Smith, Sacha Baron Cohen and Bernie Mac. I was shocked to see that Alec Baldwin was casted to star in this film. He played the villainous Makunga. The films plot is basic and continues on from where the first one left off, the animals trying to get back to New York. The Madagascar animals fly back to New York City, but crash-land on an African nature reserve, where they meet others of their own kind, and Alex especially discovers his royal heritage as prince of a lion pride. What i loved most about the plot is that it was fast paced so the film didn't dragged and was enjoyable without getting you the slightest bit of bored. What I hated about this film is that they was too many subplots going on about each main character at once, so you had to worry about more than one subplot instead of one so you could get a bit muddled with the films story. I know people are loving Moto Moto right now but I didn't like the films character. I know that I going to get lot of hate but I think that Moto Moto was just included in this film so they was able to add a story about Gloria's life in Africa. When the were looking for water nearer the end of the film you saw Moto Moto getting gold from underground but from then on Moto Moto was not mentioned for the rest of the feature so I was wondering, would ever happened to Moto Moto. Moto Moto isn't the only new character with that problem, most of the new characters which were introduced, also felt like they were just plunked into this film for the story to progress. The film doesn't suppress the humour like the first, but that doesn't mean that this film isn't funny, it is one of the funniest DreamWorks films ever made. I didn't noticed any plot holes but there most probably were plot holes. Nonetheless Madagascar Escape 2 Africa doesn't withhold the strengths of its predecessor but is still a very funny and re watchable film that I have seen countless times and it never gets old.",Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa,Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa - Movie Reviews

A new group of soldiers have been formed to combat the aliens but the new alien technology may be more than they can handle... ""The man's out of his bleeding mind. He's keeping his dead wife's finger around his neck."" Joe Pearson, director of Nick's Thanksgiving Feast, Little Dracula, and the television series Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens, Myths, & Legends, delivers War of the Worlds: Goliath. The storyline for this picture was way better and more interesting than I anticipated based on the grades this has received on here and on Netflix. I also thought the dialogue was well done and the animation has an anime feel but not too over the top. ""I guess one beer wouldn't hurt."" I found this on Netflix and decided to give it a shot.

6144,Stewart H,"Sep 08, 2014","So there I was, browsing through the new Netflix streaming content and I came across, War of the Worlds: Goliath. With a user rating of 4 stars no less, so I figure, why not. I've always liked the H. G. Wells novel, and both the 1953 and 2005 movie adaptations, so surely a Dieselpunk/Steampunk inspired animated version of the classic text should at least be entertaining. Well, not so much. War of the Worlds: Goliath, is a sequel to the classic story, and catches up with humanity fifteen years after the Martians attacked Earth. Having reverse engineered the alien war machines, early 20th century Earth sees the human race utilizing some very advanced technology. They've also set up a global initiative to recruit the best soldiers from around the world to pilot super advanced battle tripods, and prepare for the inevitable return of the Martians. Despite the rich source material, and the really intriguing concept behind the sequel, War of the Worlds: Goliath ends up being surprisingly dull. The international cast of poorly developed characters, end up being silly racial stereotypes, and the production is littered with moments of cheesy contrived melodrama. The story isn't all that complicated, yet there's so much in here that didn't make any sense to me. Its only been fifteen years since the last Martian attack ended, and there's credible evidence that a second attack is imminent. So why is everyone talking about the start of World War One? Hardly makes sense right? The Martians nearly took the planet only fifteen years ago and are coming back for round two, but let's start a global conflict using all the cool new weapons we've got! I don't know about you, but if I was the leader of the Martians, I'd just sit back and let the human race do my work for me, and then swoop in near the end to take control. The way in which the battles were fought didn't make any sense either. Soldiers repeatedly attack Martians with regular guns, shooting regular bullets, which barely scratch the paint off the invading machines. But they keep doing it anyway, and that gets old really quickly. At one point bullets hitting the protective shell on a smaller alien walker don't hurt the machine at all, but in the next shot it's easily smashed by a soldier and his knife. What? There are plenty more moments like this, and each one sadly highlighted just how poorly developed this great story premise was. On the plus side though, I did enjoy the design of the alien walkers, and the battle tripods. While a lot of the action didn't make any logical sense, it was at least decently animated and the sound design and editing was nicely done. Movie Prep: There's plenty of action to go with the cheesy dialog, and at least the effects of the Martian heat ray are decently realized. I wouldn't recommend this movie for really young children. Best Format: It's a decent looking film so a regular DVD or streaming show on a nice big TV is good enough. Best Element: The design and animation of the Martian tripods. http://talkiegazette.com/war-of-the-worlds-goliath-2012/ http://facebook.com/talkiegazette http://twitter.com/talkiegazette",War of the Worlds,War of the Worlds: Goliath - Movie Reviews

The movie still has me laughing at a lot of parts and of course, Disney has its lovable animals in the movie as well. They are really good at making you hate characters that you are supposed to hate.

Tangled is the story Rapunzel where she lets down her hair and lets her evil mother come up in her tower and tell her how bad the world is when all she wants to do is see it for herself. This was the movie that pretty much kicked off Disney’s animation for the 20th century. A lot was riding on this film and it was actually a very big success. A lot of the people in the world debate between Frozen and Tangled, personally I like Frozen a lot more. There’s not a lot wrong with this film it just didn’t really connect with me on a level that I was hoping for.

It pales in comparison to the dynamite opening act of Casino Royale, but this movie does work best as a direct follow up to that film. It picks up immediately where CR left off- Craig is still fantastic as Bond- this time playing him as a man wounded by betrayal and dead set on vengeance. The story is pretty messy, it is often unclear what is happening and why. Amidst the so-so writing however- the action is still quite solid. This is a decent action film that doesn't leave a strong impression. As a Bond movie- it is solid. This might be Craig's weakest 007 entry, and I still like it about as much as Goldeneye- Brosnan's strongest 007 entry.",Quantum of Solace,Quantum of Solace - Movie Reviews
6201,Stefan Z,"Nov 08, 2021","Ah yes, The Bourne Supremacy one. Considering this was written during the writers strike, the writing is not that bad. It even made me laugh a few times. The use of S.P.E.C.T.R.E. without legally having the rights yet was clever and intimidating. This has probably top 5 costume designs in the entire franchise, with is a huge complement because in that regard, it's almost always A+. The Bond girl is great too. Bond himself is no nonsense and Craig is giving the most no nonsense performance of his entire run here. Love it. On the other hand the Villain is a short, slimy, nothing of a frog that no one remembers. I didn't even notice he had a henchman until way past halfway through and they pretty much are the worst if not easily top 5 worst villain and henchman in the series. The villain's lair is the most bland and boring lair ever and the location it's in is even worse. There are other villainous lairs in the dessert but the dessert landscape even looks better in those other entries. The hair stylist is not doing Craig any favours. Having the gunbarrel at the end instead the beginning is a colossal sin. It gets minus half a star just for that alone. I don't care what the reason is, that this film directly follows Casino Royale. That is not an excuse. The cinematography is filtered with a disgusting sepia, but like a some kind of night time version making it even worse. There is also some weird awkward CGI use. Even with all those negatives though, I would still give it 4 stars. The editing/blocking drops this entire score down very much. Not a single shot is held long enough for me to see what is going on in relation to to their surrounding geography. The blocking in tandem makes it even harder to follow. Nothing is in frame that needs to be in frame and the shots don't track from the last shot to the next. There is supposed to be a consistent tracking focal point between shots to help guide your eye to the next shot. There is a technical term for this that I did learn in film school that I forgot now and I am too lazy to check my notes. Also, Google had no idea what the heck I was talking about after quickly checking. In addition, the shaky cam is out of control. The Bourne films and Casino Royale (2006) had shaky cam and none of those gave me the sensation of car sickness like this did. All a shame because the action action choreography is this is great or at least I think it might be great. I don't know because I just literally cannot tell what's going and not just in the action scenes either.

6211,Nathan D,"Oct 10, 2021","Quantum of Solace is a consequential mess that has very little going for it. The narrative structure of the film is unnecessarily complex. A lot of the movie uses random characters left and right without actually fleshing them out. Of course, the characters' goals are legit and fulfilled by the end, but everything else is quite half-baked. For instance, Gemma Arterton's Strawberry Fields does absolutely nothing in the film besides being a wannabe Bond Girl. This equivalent happens to other characters in the movie. The movie goes through so many characters that it is hard to formulate a strong connection among them. Yes, the script was affected by the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike. Yet, it does not make sense how the plot could get extremely confusing with worthless information. The editing is a colossal mess in this film. The unnecessary cuts used in the action scenes are atrocious and make the editors' job look sloppy. The editing also influences the way the action sequences present themselves, as it is hard to see the scene's climax when there are more than twenty cuts in just ten seconds of that single scene. Some sequences also go on for way too long, generating a monotony feel when watching the film. The cast, like Casino Royale, is probably the most enjoyable part of Quantum of Solace. Daniel Craig shines in the lead role, and his performance was solid compared to the first film. Olga Kurylenko was great in this film by carrying a lot of prominent chemistry with Craig. Kurylenko also understood how to command emotions throughout the stunts, showing that she could handle more action flicks in her career. Despite her character flaws, Gemma Arterton is satisfactory in the small role she has in the film. In a similar boat, Giancarlo Giannini makes an impact in the cast despite his small role in the movie. Finally, just like in this film's predecessor, Jeffrey Wright and Judi Dench both steal the scenes they are in and are one of the movie's highlights. When accumulating some positives of Quantum of Solace, the score comes to mind. David Arnold does a more suitable job here than before, as it felt more pertinent to the film. The score also had more traditional spy elements that supported what was on screen. The production and set design are also pretty solid, with very few flaws in those departments. Although, the disastrous editing did make it hard to appreciate it at times. Overall, Quantum of Solace struggles to maintain its identity throughout the film, making it feel like a jumble of madness. Even though there are some luminous aspects like the cast, the score, and the production design, the inadequate script and the harsh editing bring the film down significantly.

(At the time of writing this, No Time to Die has not come out, but I doubt my opinion will change.) The filmmaking style, with all the choppy editing, poor CGI, and shaky-cam action, is extremely amateurish and so disappointing after the high bar set by Casino Royale. Speaking of which, this feels more like a lazy, half-assed epilogue to that superior movie than a coherent story in and of itself. Yes the WGA strike was going at the time, and Craig himself did some rewrites, but nobody looks like they're having fun here...especially him.

This one is not better than casino royale although it features a more interesting villain played by Mathieu Alvaric. Craig is clearly now at home in this character and brings on lots of action and sexy shirtless scenes that make Craigs Bond his own. Clearly this Bond is more quiet, reserved, not always sentimental but loves to get into trouble. Judy Dench continues to mesmerize as M and Dench does a good job of developing her bond with bond no pun intended. Yet this one does not feature the strong script the previous one does. Tough we spend more time with the '' Bond Girl'' here played by Olga Kurylenko who does pretty good, the plot and mission is not always as compelling as the one in the previous film.

Daniel Craig continues to be a good James Bond, however all of the other elements let him down, from the boring plot and poor villain.

6231,James M,"Aug 21, 2021","Having so successfully carved out a new James Bond in Casino Royale, the follow up Quantum of Solace is a surprising misfire. The storyline is weak, as is the creepy Bond villain Dominic Greene, played by Mathieu Amalric. The pace of the movie is off, as it stumbles through a cumbersome script and overly complex storyline, which may take a few viewings to make sense. There are scenes that are out of place in what is supposed to be a reimagined Bond universe, like the scene where Bond and Camille skydive from their crippled plane, with only Camille wearing a parachute, the join in the air and pull the chute moments before crashing into the ground, landing hard without so much as a a broken bone or sprained ankle. Given Casino Royale was trying to create a much more realistic Bond, this scene is anything but realistic. This movie also resorted to the old ""and now Bond blows up the villain's lair"" scene at the movie's climax, which is also a let-down. There are some good bits, like the exhilarating car chase scene in the opening sequence, but this is not enough to make up for its flaws.

Dominic Greene wants to buy some land in the desert and prevent some people getting some water or something.

6234,Mohammed A,"Jul 14, 2021","Quantum of Solace is not that bad tbh. Honestly, watching the bland Spectre made me appreciate this more. Daniel Craig once again kills it as Bond and I like how he gets over the death of Vesper especially with the last scene and the movie does a decent job showing his desire of revenge with the brutal, violent action and dark tone. M is a scene stealer again, the score is great and I like how Camille has the same motivations as Bond and she has a pretty tragic backstory and it's nice having a bond girl that's not after Bond. Some of the action is also cool like the boat scene and plane scene and it's a fast paced movie with a short runtime so entertaining. I also appreciate the brutalness and violence of this movie. Seeing Mathis back as an innocent person was also sweet and on paper, the villain is interesting. Having this secret organization no one is really cool. It also has some great locations and that final battle with the house burning, reminding Camille of the day her parents died was cool visual storytelling. But it's filled with some truly monstrous editing. 70% of the action is filled with obnoxious editing: shaky cam, fast cuts, close ups so it's so hard to get invested in the otherwise well-choreographed action (you can clearly see the great stunt work) and there's too much action. There's like 3 action scenes in the first 30 minutes alone and I'm pretty sure this movie was done to make up for the lack of plot. To be fair, the film was written during the writer strike but even still, this movie's plot is incoherent, confusing and not that interesting and it's filled with a bland villain with no charisma. The actor is trying his best but the villain is not threatening and I don't care for him, which is a shame. The movie is way too short as well. At 106 minutes, there's not enough time to develop a seemingly interesting plot or characters. Even Bond's revenge story feels like it's taking the back seat. It's so rushed and the terrible editing doesn't help. I don't feel any stakes or tension. I'd much rather watch this over Spectre but even still, this is a disappointment. Need to rewatch Casino Royale honestly. (C-)",Quantum of Solace,Quantum of Solace - Movie Reviews

They are the modern equivalent of bad guys in Austin Powers, choosing not to kill people instantly with their powers but instead walk (or float) SLOWLY over to them. That's just ONE example of the bad writing. Instead of cliches and confusing camera placement to combat the bad ideas, it would have been better in the first place to not choose the first thing that comes in to the writers head. I'm slightly embarrassed for the writers. When things are badly thought out, bad scenes inevitably follow. Like cliche after cliche.

And what really made up my mind about it is...well...because I watched MIB 3 right before International. Aside from the soundtrack and the suit...it carries nothing from the previous movies. The third was a perfect blend of what made people like the first, with better special effects, clockwork humor and storytelling, and a real tour de force with the addition of Josh Brolin as young agent K. The end twist wraps up the trilogy wonderfully. You see the heart and soul of Men in Black is the chemistry between two agents fighting the absurd. I too was shocked to see a woman in black in the third, but it didn't shadowed the entire movie. I don't know why they tried to put a feminin touch to the franchise root, as I'll never understand why they did the same with Ghostbusters, but the issue here is not what they've tried, as bold as it may looks at first sight, but rather what they've accomplished : matching a Hollywood star with a rising one...and failed to make them enjoy the ride. The story is never gripping, the action is non inspiring, the drama is inexistant, and the stars were aligned for a bad omen in a science-fiction that doesn't know how to reinvent itself. Perhaps they should've made a MIB 4...because it doesn't feel international...it feels irrational.",Men in Black,Men in Black: International - Movie Reviews

6283,Stuart B,"Sep 16, 2021","Visually stunning and absolutely slathered in color, The Croods: A New Age might as well be James Cameron's Avatar in terms of its animation quality. And you don't even need the 3D glasses! The film is stuffed with delicious colors that shine and shimmer, making it impossible to want to look away. Luckily, the animators were smart enough to balance out the richness of those bright, juicy colors with plenty of more earthy, arid color climate to keep the eyes from exploding from oversaturation. Once again, we are treated to the familiar voices of Nic Cage, Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds, and the late Cloris Leachman, whose character is given a monumentally different treatment this second time around. Two newcomer voices, Leslie Mann and Peter Dinklage join the cast, but unfortunately, there's nothing all that special about their inclusion to this second installment. Luckily however, with their inclusion, comes new character dynamics and relationships. These are juggled with relative ease, which is impressive considering that the pace of the film is blink-and-you'll-miss-it all throughout. Sadly, many of the animal hybrids that joined the Croods at the coda of the original film have been discarded with no explanation (likely because they were killed, given that death is frequently mentioned as lurking around every corner out in the wasteland areas); however, new ones are introduced and they are just as lovable, if not more so than the original cast of fictional creatures. The story itself brings nothing new to the table as far as its own message is concerned. These days, it's increasingly difficult to present the message of ""don't judge people who are different than you"" in a new way, no matter what type of cinematic format or genre you include it in. This is a kids' movie at the end of the day, so you have to take its message at face value. Where this sequel far outperforms its predecessor is in the comedy. There are a number of laugh-out-loud moments from the beginning to literally the last moment. Some laughs are for the kids; some, are for the kids-at-heart, but a handful of them are universally funny, and if you're not laughing during this movie, might I suggest you see a doctor to ensure you aren't suffering from some form of depression? Between the laughter and the outright joyride that is the 3rd act, kids will likely be left with a sort of sugar rush, and the adults should, at the very least, have their endorphin count slightly increased. The Croods 2 isn't revolutionary, but it will surely leave moviegoers young and old looking forward to another chapter. And considering they capped off the film with a Tenacious D cover of The Partridge Family's ""I Think I Love You,"" we can only hope that Jack Black will return to Dreamworks Animation's recording booth for the next time we check in on our neighbors, The Croods.",The Croods,The Croods: A New Age - Movie Reviews

6285,Nathan D,"Aug 13, 2021","The Croods: A New Age doesn't live up to the first film and feels like a downgrade. The first film was such a delight with lots of heart and fun. The sequel feels like a watered-down version of the first with a lot more jokes that diminish the story. A lot of that comes down to the story which isn't that great. The story feels so bland with little to no substance. Some of the plot points are actually a bit laughable and just aren't that great. The plot points also feel borderline cliche and don't really feel all that original. There are even plot points that were reused from the first film. Grug's whole character arc in this film is the same one as the first film. There is no change whatsoever that leads the film to feel so uninspired. There are some great messages like girl power and acceptance, but they either make it too in your face or too discreet. There isn't a good balance of ideas around the film. A lot of that has to do with the pacing which is just so bad. This movie is so fast and doesn't take the time to flesh out ideas. Each scene is gone through so fast that it doesn't feel like the characters are becoming better or worse. Speaking of the characters, they are really poorly handled in this film. A lot of the characters feel half-baked with nothing special about them. The film focuses too much on Grug and Phil that the other character arcs feel washed down with no substance to them. Yes, the film is entertaining, but a movie needs to tell a good story with good characters at the same time which this film doesn't do. What didn't disappoint was the animation. The animation is such a step-up from the first film and really makes all the creative, visual ideas look so amazing. The Bettermans' land is just so vibrant and has so many different colors filling up the screen. I do wish that the character designs stayed a little bit closer to the original character designs from the first movie just because it was a little hard to adjust seeing how features were changed to fit the new animation. However, once getting used to that, the animation just shines throughout the movie. I once again loved the voice cast. Emma Stone and Ryan Reynolds really knock it out of the park and know how to make their characters feel unique. Nicolas Cage did a great job despite his character being severely flawed. Catherine Keener was also a delight to hear and her performance of Ugga was just as great as the first film. Kelly Marie Tran was such a lovely addition to the cast. She too made the character her own. It wasn't ""Kelly Marie Tran voicing a teenage girl"". It was Kelly Marie Tran making Dawn a very unique and special character. Peter Dinklage and Leslie Mann were also spectacular in this. Something Dreamworks does the best at is putting together an amazing voice cast which I think The Croods franchise shows the best. Overall, The Croods: A New Age is a step-down from its predecessor. It never feels like anything special like the first film. The humor really takes over this film which is very sad to see. With very little support from the script department, the film relies heavily on its amazing voice cast and breathtaking animation. When you take those two positives away, you get just a big ball of undeveloped fluff. Read more reviews like this at postcreditreviews.com",The Croods,The Croods: A New Age - Movie Reviews

But this movie was just as much fun and just as visually stunning as the first Croods movie. My nine-year-old daughter laughed so hard that we had to pause the playback to wait for her to catch her breath two or three times during the film. And she's pretty squarely in the film's target demographic. There's plenty for adults to enjoy as well, with sly satirical jokes peppering the script in the manner that has become the hallmark of Dreamworks Animation, and there is some wacky fun to be had in the closing sequences (no spoilers here). First-time feature director Joel Crawford does a great job of putting it all together. I look forward to seeing more from him in the future. There are a lot of movies aimed at kids out there.

This movie has some great visuals and the characters are a lot of fun to watch. However, this is one of those movies that is clearly geared for younger audiences. I don't think it is a bad movie for adults, but it isn't one of those movies that all ages will enjoy at the same level.

In addition, the events in this version are even more improbable than the original and it tends to have an uglier and nastier vibe than it did the first time around. Phil (Bradley Cooper) is meaner, Alan (Zach Galifianakis) is more obtuse, Stu (Ed Helms) is more hysterical, and Doug (Justin Bartha) is more invisible.

6345,Divyam S,"Apr 26, 2020","Today I am going to review The Hangover Trilogy. I am reviewing all the three films together because the series has now become quite old and I think no one would read full page reviews of each movie. But, if you request I would write a detailed review for each movie too. The series revolves around 4 friends, Philip(Bradley Cooper), Stu(Ed Helms), Alan ( Zach Galifianakis) and Doug ( Justin Bartha) and one more interesting, a recurring character, Chow (Ken Jeong), who is an international criminal but besides that, he is very funky. In part two, the four friends ""the wolfpack"" travel to Thailand for Stu's wedding. But things take a roll towards the previous chapter and this time Stu's future brother in law goes missing. This film is also very entertaining and I hope you will enjoy their second hangover ( I wouldn't reveal the destination). The film is equally good and well made. I find no discrepancies from the side of filmmakers, but still, you will enjoy the first part more as the same theme is being re-used here and you know that if the theme is re-used each time successively then it loses its very own essence and the perceived satisfaction decreases. But still, I give a big thumbs up to this film too.",The Hangover Part II,The Hangover Part II - Movie Reviews

6350,"Feb 12, 2020","When you create a comedy sequel, I understand it can be difficult to figure out how to recapture the magic. But if the only solution you can come up with is to do the same thing again (but bigger and more extreme) then perhaps you should just avoid trying. Sadly, this is the case with The Hangover Part II. This movie is so blatantly trying to recreate the first film that the characters keep saying things like “Oh no, it happened again!” Acknowledging your lazy idea is not good enough to excuse it. What made that first film good is completely gone in this one, and every attempt at a joke fell completely flat. The first film was kind of clever in the way it slowly laid out the breadcrumbs that would reveal the next thing that happened. It was like solving an elaborate mystery, and that kind of storyline is intriguing to me. In The Hangover, they were able to retrace their steps in a logical fashion and it felt like you could almost watch the movie in reverse and see the events of the previous night step by step. The Hangover Part II wasn’t thought out that well, and has them find random clues by chance without any logical reason, just to keep the story going. The first Hangover movie found a way to win me over so that I actually liked the characters despite their irresponsible behavior. The Hangover Part II was never able to pull that off, so I just ended up being annoyed by them. When you make this mistake once it can be a funny story, but twice and it’s a real problem. I also hate that movies like this demand that the characters maintain a bond with people who are clearly insane, like Zach Galifianakis’s character, despite the fact that every moment around this person brings them frustration and difficulty. The biggest sticking point of the film is that Ed Helms’s character is supposed to be getting married this time, and he’s worried that the bride’s family will not approve. Then they do absolutely nothing to resolve that story in a satisfying way. I don’t care how much he stands up for himself, when this idiot shows up late for his own wedding (with the bride’s brother missing a finger, a new face tattoo, and after having an affair with a transgender person) the bride herself should kill the man. The Hangover Part II is an all-around failure, and even fans of the first should avoid this sequel like the plague.",SHOW MORE,The Hangover Part II,The Hangover Part II - Movie Reviews

6388,Mark S,"Jul 30, 2021","Never have I anticipated the release of a movie as I had this one and come away so disappointed. When I heard there was a dog in the picture, I didn't expect it to be directing the movie and this is on dogs dinner. The script is not bad, Will Smith puts in a fantastic performance, you really do believe this man is the last man on earth, who had seen his family, his country and the world die in a terrible plague. Sadly the Director employed cartoonish CGI rather than user actors as the night seeking mutants. Even when Smith is supposedly hunting deer in his sports card through the empty streets it looks phony. The night seekers rather than being scary looked stupid and completely unbelievable. These are people who have supposed to have been turned into rapid mutants unable to bare the sunlight after a miracle cancer cure turns into an epidemic. Nope not these mutants they tear walls apart with their bare hands, climb on ceilings. Richard Matheson's story was problematic in the first place, when you read it, it seems once he has come up with the vampire idea he cant explain it. In the previous and best version, Charlton Heston battles against very believable mutants, who while vengeful and murderous are still sick people doomed to die of plague following germ warfare. The original film version stuck closest to the novel and would have been fine apart from a hopelessly miscast Vincent Price, whos camp delivery and Italian co-stars, weakened the movie. It says a lot that the additional features in the DVD release of I am Legend are far better than the main feature. I feel sorry for Smith and the other cast members who all did very well indeed. Even the initial shots of the deserted animal infested city were good, but the flashbacks to the unfolding disaster were badly shot, so you never really see the victims bleeding out as they fall sick with the virus. The helicopter crash scene was fairly well done but not as powerful as the same scene in the Charlton Heston version, where his pilot, suddenly falls unconcious from plague. Once you see the mutants in Will Smith version you just know you wish you hadnt walked into that movie theatre. I don't know what it is about this story but no one can get it right. Boris Segal almost managed it, but not quite. That though is for another review.",I Am Legend,I Am Legend - Movie Reviews

6431,Mr F,"Oct 06, 2021","I'll just start by addressing the elephant in the room and saying this movie is really astonishing to look at, which doesn't really mean everything is pretty or that everything is creative because the point of this movie is a place where all your nostalgia bate dreams come true. Talking about that, this movie has a surprisingly solid story for one that is based on so many different others, not amazing or amazingly smart even but still good enough to make an enticing mcguffin hunt with okay enough characters in most places. Except the villain that is, no matter how well Ben Mendelsohn plays him his entire motivation is advertising makes money and i will kill entire peoples randomly for money. On top of this, the backstory for the technology and stuff does painfully feel like it was written by someone who thinks gaming is the most important thing in the world making the movie very weird to watch for anyone who doesn't really care about this kind of random pop culture in varing levels of popularity. This would be more okay if the movie didn't take itself as seriously as it does but unfortunately it doesn't make one joke or light comment about how it's weird a bunch of kids are saving something (yes, the stakes aren't really clear either) through the power of kindof nerdy knowledge, seriously though you don't have to be a cool nerd to have seen the shining.

Secondly, the authors made a film for average gamers, but not about gamers, like, for over a decade nobody ever tried driving backwards on that race track, not even just for fun, seriously? This is outrageously stupid. But this is a movie for an average gamer, and an average gamer doesn't think critically. Thirdly, the plot is a giant cliche without any twists whatsoever, like, woah, the girl the protagonist falls in love with turns out to be a beauty in real-life, what a surprise, oh, and she has a scar that is hardly noticeable, but is there to show how the protagonist doesn't care about her looks.",Ready Player One,Ready Player One - Movie Reviews

In typical Pixar fashion they really up their game in the animation department with each film. In this movie you can see their improvement in the textures, specifically Sully's hair and their snow animation. The story here is great and the relationship between Sully and Boo, the young human girl, is the heart of the film. Randell, the antagonist, is voiced well by Steve Buscemi and is a threatening presence throughout the film. The very last scene of the movie always leaves me with the warm-fuzzies.

6460,Jon C,"Nov 02, 2021","For 2001: PIXAR's fourth animated entry continued to prove the studio's passion for storytelling resonating with audiences 'Monsters Inc' asks the question what if monsters were actually real and hid in our closets, not only that but actually lived in their own world working for a living? Actors Billy Crystal and John Goodman play Sully and Mike, two best friends who work at a company called Monsters, Inc that specializes in collecting human children's screams to turn into clean dependable energy But the days are getting tougher with kids getting harder to scare and a scare shortage might be on the rise Sully is the top scarer competing with rival Randall Mike has a girlfriend Celia and the company is run by Mr. Waternoose Things change big time when a little human girl named Boo stumbles into the monster world thereby putting Sully and Mike in a bit of a pickle Moreover all monsters are lead to believe that a single touch from a human child is toxic But Boo bonds with Mike and Sully while at the same time they try to keep her avoid getting caught in a darker conspiracy PIXAR does it again with top-notch computer graphics, wonderful voicework, a really creative setup, nice monster designs being very distinguished, funny moments, and plenty of emotional ones too Sully and Mike are the best kind of duo buddies, Boo is so adorable tugging at the heartstrings, and the writers have the monsters fear something not from their world they don't quite understand A funny twist of us being scared of monsters but having them be scared of us in return I remember seeing it in the Adirondacks with my sisters and we were enamored The movie was another hit making over $800 million A perfect mix of pathos, humor, adventure, and heartbreak I like Jennifer Tilly as Celia and Steve Buscemi as Randall Im really glad too they put the movie as a level in Kingdom Hearts 3 20 years later and the movie still leaves a big impact on our culture as well as animation fans even spawning a prequel, video games, and a recent Disney + tv series 'Monsters Inc' is one of the earliest examples of children's entertainment that works telling a human story with non-human characters at the helm","Monsters, Inc.","Monsters, Inc. - Movie Reviews"

6467,Puroo R,"Aug 20, 2021","My first ever exposure to Monsters, Inc. was when we had gone to McDonald's and I got a Mike Wazowski toy. I was really scared of it, and my sister used to often scare me with it. Little did I know that Mike is supposed to be the comic relief of the movie. Later on I saw the trailer, and eventually the whole movie. And now I can say with a guarantee that Monsters Inc is one of the better Disney movies. Sure there are some things I didn't like (which I will talk about later) but other than those things, this is absolutely perfect. One thing I really like about Pixar is that they always take one thing we like from our lives and then expand it into a full blown story. You play with toys? There's Toy Story. You like fishes and the ocean? There's Finding Nemo. You like cars? There's...well, Cars. So similarly over here we were all afraid of monsters coming into our rooms when we were sleeping alone as kids, and that's what this movie is based on. Unlike the conventional monsters who want to kill us, these monsters are working for a power company who just use children's screams for powering up their world. The story revolves around Sullivan and his best friend Mike Wazowski, who work at Monsters, Inc. Sully is a professional scarer while Mike collects the screams from the children. However, there is one rule that the monsters must abide by - children should not learn about their world otherwise they will no longer be scared and the monster world will run out of energy. Things go down very badly when Mike and Sully find out that Sully accidentally brought a little girl named Boo back to their world. Meanwhile Randall, the second best scarer and Sully's rival, is making a scream extractor which will help him extract the most screams and make him the best employee. The movie is twenty years old and still the world shown here is very dynamic even by today's standards. The third act where Sully, Mike, Boo and Randall are jumping from one door to another was very cool. The animation is also very good, especially the fact that every single hair on Sully's body is distinguishable, and all the pores on Randall's body can be seen. The comic timing is also great, like the part where Randall says, ""Say hello to my scream extractor!"" and Mike immediately says ""Hello."". And also the part where Sully thinks Boo got crushed so he faints just as the emotional music starts playing. Now like I said, there are a couple of things I didn't like in this movie, which is what stopped me from giving it a perfect score. First of all I really liked Randall. He was my favourite character in the whole movie. He looks cool, his superpowers are admirable and he's stronger than he looks. But he still loses to humans. First with Boo, who is literally a child who can't even speak. And then by grown humans who beat him with a broom in the end. It would have been better if he got stuck in the middle of nowhere like he made Sully and Mike do so. And the second thing is the part where they are in Nepal. That was boring to say the least. Monsters, Inc. is one of those movies that can be enjoyed by both children and adults. It is very rare for a Disney movie to be that way nowadays, so it can be revisited back even today. Like I said, its animation has aged very well, which is why it is so much fun to watch it without feeling something is off. And it has a sequel too, something it took me too long to learn about. I really liked it compared to most movies Disney has been making nowadays.","Monsters, Inc.","Monsters, Inc. - Movie Reviews"

6475,Jacob R,"Jun 22, 2021","Man, Pixar kicked this century off with a bang! Also, expect a lot of repeated points from the Toy Story 2 review until probably Cars. So yeah, I just don't feel like spelling it out, but I am. This is movie is basically perfect in ever way possible. Going off the Toy Story 2 review, this has the comedy down, the great characters, and the emotion. Man does this movie have emotion! However, this movie starts the trend of the ending being the most emotional moment of the movie. Of course, this is one of the best examples of that. If I really had to find something to complain about (just because it's a movie review and you have to talk about something negative), it's that Mike can be a little bit too much of a jerk sometimes, but he's really funny, so he can get away with it. He's definitely less annoying then someone like Mr Potato Head in the first Toy Story, far from it. So yeah, if you haven't seen this one, shame on you! Go to Disney+ and watch it now!

Billy Crystal's performance just give so much energy to the character. However the one problem that I have with the movie is the villain Randal. I just didn't find him that interesting. However even though he's not as interesting to me he does provide some funny moments as well. However with all that being said there is a twist villain that is much better and can be really interesting for the movie.

Mais Operation Red Sea doit être jugé au niveau du discours qu'il déploie, celui-ci aussi nauséabond qu'un Wolf Warrior II. Malgré toutes ses fabuleuses scènes d'action (ce film ne s'arrête JAMAIS), son sens de la mise en scène (Dante Lam est le meilleur réalisateur d'action dans le monde aujourd'hui), ce discours non seulement patriotique mais surtout nationaliste fait passer Operation Red Sea pour un film de Leni Riefenstahl mis en image par Michael Bay 2.0.

6521,Charles G,"Jul 27, 2018","This film is a mess. It varies in quality between B Movie and top notch effects, as if several scenes were tacked on at the end of filming when the budget was spent. The director attempts to distract the viewer from the absence of any sense of realism in the strategy of the action by making it as chaotic as possible, with the only pauses in the action inserted almost nonsensically in order to throw a bit of dramatic acting in the mix. The scenes change so rapidly that it can be confusing to follow just whom is supposed to be where or what the dangers are, and at times it becomes a Call of Duty simulation as the main antagonists put James Bond to shame in terms of their ability to avoid bullets... until it's time to wrap up the plot in which case all of a sudden the stubborn Chinese soldiers become human again.

Despite the jingoism and patriotic intent to save lives not only Chinese but Africans as well as foreigners, actions in the films bridges the understanding of those involved in operations tend to be more understanding about the nature of soldiering. The constant manner of visions of death, decapitations, dangerously near dying, etc, depicts the gruesome images conflict operations can become. Survivability is only via aggressive and offensive participation to stay alive and fear is the grim reaper's calling. When Dante Lam directed Operation Mekong, the actions are less tragic but still Dante loved to embrace that 'brave encouragement' to fight on in the face of facing multiple deathly threats and firepower. This film will be good for China, as the film will encourage young Chinese that China can do good in the world if its force is used in the right way.",Operation Red Sea,Operation Red Sea - Movie Reviews

Interesting characters and relationships (for an ensemble). I read reviews saying there was no character development and wonder if that perception is just unconscious racism - all chinese look alike. i'm not asian but i got a sense of most of the main characters as individuals, and mourned the losses along the way. Physical effects were generally high-quality, including heaps of graphic shots of injuries and bodies (you have been warned) and an isis-style beheading (it does not cut away). again though, this stuff is not gratuitous and serves the theme of self-sacrifice. admittedly some of the computer effects were second-rate - cgi seems to be the 'jet engine' of chinese cinema.",Operation Red Sea,Operation Red Sea - Movie Reviews

6594,John P,"Feb 21, 2021","First off I'm shocked Danny elfman did the musical score for this. (It was actually really well done) I thought it was a pretty sick and disgusting movie but on the other hand, the performances were alright, its cinematography was beautiful, and it had a sleek look to all its trashy content. Weeknds song earned it was alright but it's not my favorite out of his library. Since its based off of twilight fan fiction I'd say that film was better. Even after we colided is better than this trashy mess. I wouldn't say this is bad, persay, but its not a good movie, as its too sick, and overly sexual. But it does have a few good things going for it in terms of filmmaking, musical score, songs and acting, and I will say (sigh) it can succeed in being trashy (even though I don't like how trashy it can get) 5/10, maybe even a 6.

6605,Meydiana R,"Nov 04, 2020","I felt violated afterwards! This movie basically tries to make abuse look sexy! The characters have the emotional IQ of a three year old, especially the lead female role. I read two of the three books out of pure curiosity, but started skipping entire pages and later chapters just to get through the book. Who has sex three or four times a day!? The books are childlike and absolutely boring. Also, they have no storyline other than two people permanently having sex, a woman with no backbone and an absolutely narcissistic controlling man! Also, if you tell a guy that you are still a virgin, his response should NOT BE let me help you with that problem!!! The movie and the books are creepy. Since when has it become sexy for a woman not to be able to choose how she wants to dress, what she wants to eat, where she wants to go....even her cellphone, exercise and waxing habits are under his control. She is basically just a possession. The movie is rated 16 only! Not nearly enough. I sat in the movies with giggling 16-18 year olds and thought to myself this movie should not be seen by anyone younger than 25 and in a healthy relationship with common sense to realize that this is not healthy or normal. I would feel ashamed if I was the parent who allowed my 16 year old to watch this movie! This is the basis that these emotionally fragile children will build their relationships on one day!

For sure this is a bad movie but for what all the ""hype "" was for this movie I can kinda understand it. This is not an everybody type of movie.

For sure this has one of the worst movie endings of all time because it's just so dumb and cheesy. This is surprisingly not boring. The side characters are boring 100 percent but the two main characters are pretty interesting aka only Christian grey because you want to see why he does this stuff.

6614,Mark H,"Jul 23, 2020","Remember when everybody was talking about the book Fifty Shades of Grey by E. L. James? Do you also remember the equally terrible movie adaptation on Valentine's Day weekend in 2015? The story of Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) and her sadomasochistic relationship with young businessman Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) has been the most entertainingly awful piece of literature and a subject of parody in the first half of the 2010 decade. What made the novel so infamous were the exaggerated sex scenes and the laughable internal monologue. The movie however, trims those elements down in favor of a conventional romantic drama instead of raising the bar with James's text. Don't get me wrong, Fifty Shades of Grey isn't without saucy moments, but there are so few drips to squeeze and they get bogged down by scenes of Mr. Grey gawking Anastasia with materialism, stalking her at dinner parties, or sending creepy text messages. Christian has an entire collection of whips, butt plugs, and other BDSM sex toys, yet he never takes advantage of them in the movie. With the funny narration being replaced by generic pop songs, the film also loses its charisma and never explores Annie's lustful desires. I'm not asking for this movie to be ultra-pornographic, but I expected more steamy activity than just hard spanking and rubbing ice on the nipples. Despite Sam Taylor-Johnson's effort to better the book's prose, the result of Fifty Shades of Grey is extremely mild and not the least bit titillating.

There is just too much CGI (though not as much as Peter Jackson's take on King Kong. The worldbuilding and expanding upon the first monster-verse film, ""Godzilla,"" is really well, and the after-credits scene promises a future crossover between these two monsters.

6631,Cailan D,"Aug 19, 2021","Another solid outing in the MonsterVerse, Skull Island lives up to the bar set 3 years earlier by Godzilla and is another exciting and engaging kaiju film. Skull Island does a lot of stuff right that Godzilla also did: it has a story, a human-centric perspective and a good amount of build up to the conflict of the movie. This time, we get to the fighting a lot sooner than we did in Godzilla, but not so soon that the movie feels like it's entirely based on it, making this an improvement on Godzilla. The script and directing allow for the characters to be interesting and have some nice and funny dialogue, and also for the story of the movie to flow and develop nicely which helps to keep viewers invested in what's happening. The movie has some twists and turns along the way that spice things up and keep the movie interesting for both the viewers and characters, and does a nice job of tying the opening scene into the plot of the movie without it feeling too disruptive. Skull Island also does a great job of not squandering it's A-list cast, being actors such as Tom Hiddleston and John Goodman, by giving all the big characters plenty of dialogue and moments to shine a little bit. It also gives it's lesser known actors the same opportunities, something I appreciated. The big-monster fighting action is great and is just as good as it was in Godzilla, which works immensely to this film's benefit cause we get a bit more of it than we did in Godzilla. I like how Skull Island gives the humans more of an opportunity to fight and hurt the big monster antagonist of this film, since Godzilla did most of the work in the other movie, and it shows that humans aren't completely useless against these creatures and they can lend a helping hand. All that said, SI suffers from the same predictability that Godzilla did, and it's very easy to figure out, for the most part, what's going to happen. There isn't too much mystery in this movie and a lot of what goes on follows typical expectations. There's really only one curveball that the movie throws in, but other than that it all goes according to formula. The other issue I have with this movie is character stupidity. A lot of what goes wrong for the characters in this movie is because of their own actions, so most of what they go through is because of their own doing. To put it in broader terms, they create their own demons and pay the price for that severely. The fates many of the characters suffer is avoidable, unnecessary and founded in decisions based on emotion. Many of them do their best to get out of the situation that they're in, but are hampered by the actions of other characters. This is an area where this movie falters a bit from Godzilla. Despite these flaws, Skull Island is a great kaiju movie that hits the bar set by Godzilla in many ways and is another solid installment in the MonsterVerse.",Kong: Skull Island,Kong: Skull Island - Movie Reviews
6632,Puroo R,"Aug 18, 2021","Honestly I hate King Kong. I can't stand seeing an ugly gorilla killing cool dinosaurs. Initially I had skipped this movie and directly watched Godzilla: King of the Monsters, but seeing how many references of this movie that movie had in the post credits and the fact that I needed to watch this to understand Godzilla vs Kong is why I watched this movie in the first place (I still haven't watched Godzilla vs Kong though lmao). This movie, however, wasn't that bad. In fact the CGI is pretty good. But that doesn't change the fact that an ugly gorilla is killing cool looking Skullcrawlers here, although I was satisfied that he could win only with the human help. Samuel Jackson plays the role of an annoying general who gets his comeuppance (which is the reason why I have given it such a good rating). He was so irritating. When he said he will kill all the Skullcrawlers after he kills Kong I felt like going in the screen and slapping him. Like, just one scene ago your entire squad got thrashed by only one Skullcrawler child and here you're dreaming of taking down every single one of them you zoophobe!? The movie takes place on an island in the 70's. Although Kong gets very less screen time and there is too much talking and exposition, it wasn't as bad as the Godzilla movies. The human characters were actually interesting. I liked the part where one of them dies when a giant spider steps on him and everyone thinks it's a tree. The professor who explains the entire context of the tribes worshipping Kong was also an interesting story. In the end they all manage to get away from the island and tell the world about what they saw. It was a good ending. If they had done something like saying why they were going to keep it a secret I'd have legit given it a 1 star rating. The CGI has been done very well. Although it features a number of cool creatures (the Skullcrawlers especially), it does not induce the same frantasy feeling that Godzilla movies do. It only makes it feel like giant creatures fighting in an island. It doesn't feel ""legendary"", like what you feel when you watch King of the Monsters' trailer. It just looks... Meh. Kong: Skull Island may not be some very extraordinary movie, but you do have to watch it if you want to watch Godzilla vs Kong. It's a bit annoying but makes it up with the colour palette. I really hope this is the last time I'm seeing the ugly gorilla. Because I am never going to re-watch this.",Kong: Skull Island,Kong: Skull Island - Movie Reviews

6641,"Jun 05, 2021","'Kong: Skull Island' has once again shown that in this cinematic monster universe, the VFX created monsters are the best characters that can be developed throughout their film. This second installment of the monster universe after the first 'Godzilla' proves to be almost an exact copy. Audiences are given a monster where half of the cast wishes to kill it and the others understand and empathize with it. Only this time, there is some more development within certain characters such as John C. Reilly's character which had the best lines and most in-depth story. Unfortunately no one else on screen truly shined. Samuel L. Jackson did a great job, but was unsympathetic towards audiences with his character's personality and decisions. The movie is also very scary at points which is enjoyable to see from a film such as this. The VFX were astonishingly well-done and Oscar-worthy.

6681,Dale R,"Nov 15, 2021","Lightning McQueen is challenged to a World Grand Prix, a series of three races in three different countries, and brings along his best friend Mater who gets involved in an international espionage plot. Creating a movie where the main protagonist is now the comedic side character from the first movie is a difficult undertaking. The most difficult part is creating a story arc, including character growth, for the comedic character that the audience can get behind. This movie tries to move Mater to a logical growth arc, but at the end of it he isn't the same loveable tow truck we fell in love with during the first movie. In addition, I'm not sure what it was about the car universe that was created in the first movie that demanded a spy thriller movie. This plot seems to come out of nowhere. Props to Larry the Cable Guy for doing the best he could with what he was given. Michael Caine also does a great job in the voice acting department. The backgrounds of the three races are spectacular! If you enjoyed the first movie or this plot sounds interesting to you, then check this movie out.",Cars 2,Cars 2 - Movie Reviews

The comedy is obvious, unfunny and repetitive and makes me want to push mator in his stupid face beacause i really can't stand films that use a character's stupidity as a crutch for the story. Lightning McQeen manages to have understandable goals and still be an unlikeable idiot while the rest of the characters find some way to look past Mator's stupidity or are also stupid wich doesn't make sense considering how smart they are supposed to be as super spies. Also, about that superspies thing: Why? I don't know but, weirdly i kind of enjoyed it because of how much it related to the Cars universe (i can't believe i just wrote that i mean what has my life come to) as does the villain who isn't fleshed out in the slightest but has an interesting storyline so… I actually quite like the story and how it goes around the world because this fillm isn't boring in the slightest and you will experience a series of different emotions while watching it: anger, confusion and hilarity.

(She's also taken a real shine recently to U2's utterly under appreciated masterpiece, 1993's Zooropa). When Cars 2 had finished, one of my first thoughts was that they had learned their lesson in cutting the run time down. Imagine my surprise when I realised Cars 2 is 3 minutes longer than its predecessor. Cars 2 got panned on release, and it's true, it has issues (McQueen's best friend with whom we are supposed to sympathise remains pretty annoying) but the main drive (whey) and selling point of Cars 2 is that it's essentially a James Bond film, with cars. Far from being dismissive rubbish, Cars 2 is a real spectacle. It looks superb, it's globetrotting is very Bondian, and the real life locations reproduced in glittering, shiny animation transports you across the world, and, yes, made me feel like I was there, as ridiculous as that sounds. What the original film did well was the racing sequences; so Cars 2 ups the anti, with more of them, in fantastical environments, especially a genuinely jaw dropping picturesque race in Porto Corsa (based on Monaco). Michael Caine has great fun as an Aston Martin spy, we're introduced to him in the opening sequence, a spectacular action piece on an oil rig. Cars 2 is not Pixar's best film, and it is flawed, but the further I've got through writing this review, the more I've realised I thought it was tremendous.",Cars 2,Cars 2 - Movie Reviews

The first Cars had a similar problem, in that the whole idea of a world where cars and select other vehicles replace ordinary people, just doesn't work with the plot, making us question more about the premise of the film than had it just been called ""humans racing"" and been about human sprinters rather than racecars. Cars 2 exacerbates this problem to the utmost of extremes, providing what is essentially a James Bond film that could have been really good if it were about people, but the clunky nature of its premise just makes the whole thing seem less like a typical Pixar passion project and more like just a shameless cashgrab. When the plot of a film undermines the premise of that film, it's fundamentally flawed before even crossing the starting line.",Cars 2,Cars 2 - Movie Reviews

And the music by Michael Giacchino is actually pretty good. But even with all of that though, I'm sitting here wondering why? Why are we having this random spy racing thriller? It just doesn't make any sort of sense. Also the villains plot is so confusing. Also I really don't care about any of the new characters. Everything about this movie just feels pointless. The only way that I would ever recommend this movie is that if you want to watch a Pixar movie but you don't want to think like the other Pixar movies would normally let you would and just turn your brain off and have somewhat of a good time, then yeah this is the Pixar film for you.

By saying this I am not saying it is weights, but simply meh. The animations are definitely the best point of the film, with excellent graphics and meticulous details, as well as I liked how the customs of the countries were conceived in a non-stereotypical way (an Italian says it). The backgrounds are pretty. For this film it was decided to shift the focus from Lightning to Mater, a rather questionable choice. Why give such an important role to a comedic sidekick? But above all, what did Mater have to say? A morality was created for him that he did not need. In the end he only realized that Mater was a comedic sidekick. Which we already understood. In Finding Dory, Dory was a comedic sidekick, but they still managed to create a great insight for her into her short-term memory and her family. Which unfortunately is lost in Mater. After all, Lightning is a bit of a regression of personality, making it difficult to recognize from how it came out in the first film. The two spies are not of great character, but I would not go so far as to say that they do not. The villain is another of the problems of this film. The villain is twist and therefore, in fact, the spectator must find out together with the spies who is sabotaging the race. Unfortunately the detective storyline doesn't work. In this genre, usually, you are presented with a lot of characters, all not completely innocent, so that the viewer finds out together with the detective who is the culprit. In Cars 2, in addition to the spies and the main protagonists, we have the competitors of the race and Axlerod, the organizer of the event. Being able to guess that the competitors cannot sabotage themselves, breast would be idiotic, Axlerod remains. I know that the film is aimed at a younger audience (which I would not expect from Pixar anyway), but here it is a bit exaggerating. The story is not that great and indeed it is a bit predictable, with Spy elements that have absolutely nothing to do with the racing world and clash. The Twist, as already mentioned, was handled very badly. The jokes are not sought after and fall a bit into childish. Cars 2 never gets off to a good start - this blatant cash grab Disney wanted to sell merchandise doesn't offer anything really interesting on the table. Despite this, the well-kept animations and an all in all enjoyable story make Cars 2 a film that I would not fully recommend, but it will not be pitiful to see. With an uninspired protagonist, ultra-predictable villain but superlative animations, Cars 2 is Pixar's ""worst"" product.",Cars 2,Cars 2 - Movie Reviews

They are completely different,but they are best friends. There is lot of nice,simple humor in the story. The scenario is ""smooth"" and it is easy watchable. There are much of action,surprises,cool techniques,like in James Bond. Yes,we could not expect that,but it is really OK .The characters are in many different places and they are meeting a different people. Characters are 3D,they have feelings and we feel empathy about them. But,there is a ""dark side"" of film,which is not like Pixar. Enemies,propaganda and that stuff. These problems confuses and my 10 year old brother. It is not ugly or violent,it is just confusing to kids. About animation,I will not discuss. It is still Pixar;great animations and visuals and everything about it. This is family film and it is really relaxing and enjoyable. Maybe sometimes is confusing,but it is not acctualy so bad.

6734,Mel V,"Dec 18, 2005","During the extended production of the [i]Lord of the Rings[/i] trilogy, filmmaker Peter Jackson collaborated on a series of web-based production diaries. The diaries covered all aspects of production, from set building and costuming to special effects. In order to account for users with low bandwidth capabilities, the diaries were kept to a relatively brief three to seven minutes long. The diaries allowed fans of the [i]Ring[/i] trilogy (and Tolkien's novels, of course) insight to the complexities of filmmaking on a scale rarely attempted. When Jackson announced his next project, a remake of [i]King Kong[/i], his collaborator on the web diaries for the [i]Lord of the Rings[/i] trilogy, Michael Pellerin, suggested that another set of production diaries would serve a similar function, keeping Jackson in contact with his loyal fanbase (not to mention excellent pre-release publicity for [i]King Kong[/i], but that was apparently a secondary concern). The end result of Jackson's collaboration with Pellerin, 54 production diaries spanning the 131 days of principal photography that began in September 2005 and ended in April 2005 (exclusive of pick-ups, which involved flying the central cast and some supporting actors back to New Zealand for insert shots or new scenes), have been removed from Pellerin's website, kongisking.net and repackaged on a two-DVD box set as [i]King Kong: Peter Jackson's Production Diaries[/i], complete with a 52-page scrapbook, production art prints, and even a letter of authenticity. Since the producers of [i]King Kong[/i], Universal Studios, owned the rights to the production diaries, the diaries were pulled from Pellerin's website, kongisking.net, before the release of the DVD set on December 13, 2005. Pellerin's website, however, still hosts more than 30 post-production diaries that are potentially as insightful (if not more so) than the production diaries. The post-production diaries are probably best downloaded now, while they're still available (presumably they'll be pulled from the website sometime soon and repackaged into an extras-heavy extended or special edition of [i]King Kong[/i]). The production diaries open with a slightly harried, but still plump Peter Jackson (he lost over 70 pounds over the last year and a half) announcing the first day (actually night) of shooting aboard the full-scale mock-up of the S.S. Venture (Jackson suffers from seasickness, so he couldn't shoot on the actual ship). As the diaries evolve, Jackson, often wearing his favorite shirt (either that or he owns multiple copies of the same yellow shirt) introduces his fans to key members of the behind-the-scenes production crew, including his cinematographer, production designer, miniatures and model makers, and special effects staff at Weta Digital (Weta Workshop provides physical effects and props). The diaries essentially work their way down the production hierarchy, stopping to interview production managers, carpenters, and even transport drivers. The first disc focuses primarily on the creation of Skull Island, from concept art, to the building of full-scale sets and scaled miniatures (on the order of 1/10 or 1/20) to add depth and breadth to the vistas of an impossibly primeval world. Several production diaries cover the creation of the ship that takes the central characters to Skull Island, the S.S. Venture, which exists as a seaworthy ship, a full-scale replica built on a backlot, interior cabins and storage on a soundstage, and a highly detailed miniature. Although the first disc briefly covers the New York set building, most of the second disc covers the filming of the New York City scenes which bookend [i]King Kong[/i] ([i]King Kong[/i] has roughly three major locations, New York City, the S.S. Venture, and Skull Island, with the central characters returning to New York City in the third hour). The second disc roughly follows the scenes filmed on the set of a recreated New York City (a combination of physical structures, some only partially built, miniatures, and digital effects), circa 1933. The cast, of course, is on hand to lend their support, with Jack Black joking his way through the diaries. Naomi Watts shows more reticence in front of the video camera, but viewers do get the opportunity to hear Naomi speak with her native, Australian accent (she moved to Australia from England when she was 14).

The current two-disc DVD of the production diaries does have an additional diary unavailable on the website, a 16-minute featurette that covers the over-the-top fight sequence between Kong and three T-Rexes on Skull Island, from conception through realization.

6741,Mel V,"Dec 18, 2005","During the extended production of the [i]Lord of the Rings[/i] trilogy, filmmaker Peter Jackson collaborated on a series of web-based production diaries. The diaries covered all aspects of production, from set building and costuming to special effects. In order to account for users with low bandwidth capabilities, the diaries were kept to a relatively brief three to seven minutes long. The diaries allowed fans of the [i]Ring[/i] trilogy (and Tolkien's novels, of course) insight to the complexities of filmmaking on a scale rarely attempted. When Jackson announced his next project, a remake of [i]King Kong[/i], his collaborator on the web diaries for the [i]Lord of the Rings[/i] trilogy, Michael Pellerin, suggested that another set of production diaries would serve a similar function, keeping Jackson in contact with his loyal fanbase (not to mention excellent pre-release publicity for [i]King Kong[/i], but that was apparently a secondary concern). The end result of Jackson's collaboration with Pellerin, 54 production diaries spanning the 131 days of principal photography that began in September 2005 and ended in April 2005 (exclusive of pick-ups, which involved flying the central cast and some supporting actors back to New Zealand for insert shots or new scenes), have been removed from Pellerin's website, kongisking.net and repackaged on a two-DVD box set as [i]King Kong: Peter Jackson's Production Diaries[/i], complete with a 52-page scrapbook, production art prints, and even a letter of authenticity. Since the producers of [i]King Kong[/i], Universal Studios, owned the rights to the production diaries, the diaries were pulled from Pellerin's website, kongisking.net, before the release of the DVD set on December 13, 2005. Pellerin's website, however, still hosts more than 30 post-production diaries that are potentially as insightful (if not more so) than the production diaries. The post-production diaries are probably best downloaded now, while they're still available (presumably they'll be pulled from the website sometime soon and repackaged into an extras-heavy extended or special edition of [i]King Kong[/i]). The production diaries open with a slightly harried, but still plump Peter Jackson (he lost over 70 pounds over the last year and a half) announcing the first day (actually night) of shooting aboard the full-scale mock-up of the S.S. Venture (Jackson suffers from seasickness, so he couldn't shoot on the actual ship). As the diaries evolve, Jackson, often wearing his favorite shirt (either that or he owns multiple copies of the same yellow shirt) introduces his fans to key members of the behind-the-scenes production crew, including his cinematographer, production designer, miniatures and model makers, and special effects staff at Weta Digital (Weta Workshop provides physical effects and props). The diaries essentially work their way down the production hierarchy, stopping to interview production managers, carpenters, and even transport drivers. The first disc focuses primarily on the creation of Skull Island, from concept art, to the building of full-scale sets and scaled miniatures (on the order of 1/10 or 1/20) to add depth and breadth to the vistas of an impossibly primeval world. Several production diaries cover the creation of the ship that takes the central characters to Skull Island, the S.S. Venture, which exists as a seaworthy ship, a full-scale replica built on a backlot, interior cabins and storage on a soundstage, and a highly detailed miniature. Although the first disc briefly covers the New York set building, most of the second disc covers the filming of the New York City scenes which bookend [i]King Kong[/i] ([i]King Kong[/i] has roughly three major locations, New York City, the S.S. Venture, and Skull Island, with the central characters returning to New York City in the third hour). The second disc roughly follows the scenes filmed on the set of a recreated New York City (a combination of physical structures, some only partially built, miniatures, and digital effects), circa 1933. The cast, of course, is on hand to lend their support, with Jack Black joking his way through the diaries. Naomi Watts shows more reticence in front of the video camera, but viewers do get the opportunity to hear Naomi speak with her native, Australian accent (she moved to Australia from England when she was 14). We also get the chance to see Jackson take his cast and major crewmembers to New York City and, of course, the Empire State Building (Naomi looks distinctly uncomfortable, huddled as far away from the edge as possible).

The movie was all about space, astroids, rockets etc but there was zero logic. Michael Bay is already known for making non-logical long movies. This movie was too long (2hr25min) and too slow. You will loose interest after some time or even get bored to death. At one time, it seems like movie will never end. Only thing that saved movie was performance by Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck. Rest, everything was bad. These types of movie was basically made for enjoyment but the way this movie was executed it seems like this movie was made for torture.

The movie's got a great story, which is about these NASA astronauts finding out that a large asteroid will destroy earth in the next eighteen days. However, they find out that their only way to save earth is by getting this oil driller called Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and for him to recruit a team. The acting throughout this movie is honestly great especially from the main characters who are in this movie. The dialogue which is given from the characters throughout this movie is very hit and miss. There is some really good dialogue at times but sometimes there can be some very cheesy dialogue throughout this movie. Also, the humour throughout this movie is honestly really good, especially from Rockhound (Steve Buscemi) he's got so many funny moments in this movie. The cinematography from John Schwartzman is decent. He captures the scenes pretty well throughout this movie but sometimes the lighting isn't so good. The movie's got some pretty good pacing for most of the build ups, which end up happening throughout this movie. Finally, the movie's got a brilliant soundtrack. The soundtrack features some great songs from such artists as Aerosmith, Bob Seger and Bon Jovi. The movie's got a few little stupid moments scattered throughout and some scenes which take you out of the movie. Overall, Armageddon is honestly a great movie.

This has a great premise and stacked cast which is incredibly well balanced not only between the ""diggers"", but the control crew and the astronauts as well. While they take that opportunity use the characters to really build the world, the story really just boils down to ""meteor going to kill earth"" and ""guy and girl connection, but girl's daddy doesn't like"". Surprisingly the latter takes up a significant amount of time in the movie, but everyone gets their moment in the spotlight. Steve Buscemi definitely has some of the most memorable moments in the movie. This is the first movie I can think of that has this sort of detail of space travel, let alone tried to simulate the hellish landscape of an asteroid. It really feels like they put the production value into not only to making the movie look good but getting the details right.

The whole tsunami sequence and then subsequent freezing scenes are just spectacular to watch even today. The acting is a little shoddy, with decent performances from Dennis Quaid and Sela Ward. Otherwise the film is really just a special effects extravaganza geared towards making a statement against global warming. As a film, its super entertaining as a disaster movie. As a movie on critiquing a serious issue like global warming and pollution, the film lacks a little. Its commendable that Emmerich has tried to make a disaster film tied into a more serious issue.

Nothing encapsulates this better than the death scene for Ian Holm and his pals. Doomed to freeze to death in northern Scotland, they toast each other with the last Scotch whisky in the bottle. The toast? ""To England."" Now, for anyone who doesn't know better, calling a Scotsman ""English"", or Scotland ""England"" is the sort of remark that'll get you a size 9 boot up your backside in any Scottish boozer you care to visit. Compound it with drinking whisky at the same time and you've got a level of gauche ignorance which is irritating. Sadly, combine this with an at times excruciating and ridiculously pat story and it's a one watch only disaster of a film. It's also lazy. Granted, one sacrificial second line good guy croaks, but otherwise it's tokenism and a lot of heroic Caucasian 'Murricans winning the day for the USA, and btw invading Mexico because the US of A is a bit parky now.

If you're going to have a disaster movie night I would suggest a double-bill with 2012, which had a bigger budget, fast and furious, over the top type effects and doesn't take itself to seriously.

On christmas his parents give him a Teddy bear that he calls Ted, due to his lonely and ankward nature this Teddy bear serves as his best friend; he also constantly wishes that his friend becomes real. One day his wish comes true and Ted comes alive, the two then become inseperable friends from then and out. 35 years later they live in the same apartment and are still on good terms with each other, but this time with a catch John now has a girlfriend; a office worker that goes by the name of Lori. Lori hates Ted because she thinks that it causes her boyfriend's life to be immature and stale, this prompts her to give him an ultimatum; that being he has to choose between her or his best friend. Pros: -Can sometimes be funny and enjoyable -Great performances from the main leads -Has the ability to shift the mood to it's favor Cons: -Family Guy humor consisting of shit, fart, racist, nudity, profanity, drug usage and homophobic jokes plus outdated pop culture references, oh and some jokes that just revolve around random stupidity as well -Stereotypical characters and execution -Plot is way too straightforward and predictable -Has moments where it legit makes you cringe and makes you pause the movie -Is not consistently funny enough -Weird soundtrack Overall Ted is a movie best watched when you and your friend are drunk over at your mom's house, or when you just want some quick laughs. It legitemelety feels like live action family guy, except Peter is now a talking Teddy bear. It is a movie about Immatury and scatological humor so your enjoyment of it will depend on if you like it or not, to top it all off it is also not consistently funny enough; sometimes cringe and stupid; in addition to that it has a predictable plus basic plot.

I love stupid humor and dirt comedy, basically absurdist comedy which Seth MacFarlane excels at. The cast is great, and I think it would have been a very different movie if they had used anyone else in any role. The concept alone is unique and refreshing, ""Did you see the movie about the teddy bwear that came to life?"", that's this movie. You almost owe it to yourself to see such a unique concept. And they they do some fantastically structure humor mixed with some rather contrastingly serious romantic drama. They even mix in a touch of horror, and I was even able to get into it, despite it being about a Teddy Bear that has express displeasure about not being constructed with a penis. I can't imagine ever watching this and not being entertained.",Ted,Ted - Movie Reviews

6874,Jayson B,"Sep 06, 2020","Me and my friend recently watched Ted the movie after he watched both movies earlier in the year. I was given good expectations for the film and while some of the jokes land pretty well and the concept is executed better than it could have been the story itself left me wanting something better and some of the choices the film made just didn't work for me. Specifically the psycho family that kidnaps Ted later in the film. Also while some jokes land pretty well this is a comedy and a lot of the story itself is played for laughs. Some of it is just painfully unfunny like the character of Teds girlfriend, the aforementioned family, and other small moments. The things that did work were sometimes over emphasized and the story while very contained just wasn't for me. While I can see this movie working for other people it just didn't for me. There is nothing wrong with the story but there are plenty of things wrong for me as a viewer. I think that this is the kinda movie that was made for certain audiences specifically those who grew up in the 80s. Still my friend enjoyed it for what it is and I did too it was funny at times. However I would not re watch this film and although I will probably end up watching it I am not exited for the sequel that was released. Also Teds voice sounds way to much like Peter Griffin as mentioned in the movie which I appreciate self awareness but the voice needed to be more distinct in order for the character to be any more than Peter Griffin in a teddy bears body hanging out with a immature Mark Wahlberg.",Ted,Ted - Movie Reviews

6887,Divyam S,"Apr 26, 2020","All things considered, a few motion pictures are with the end goal that they are adored by crowds of each age gathering. The film about which I am going to discuss today falls under that class, Ted and Ted 2. The film rotates around John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) who during his youth days, on the event of Christmas Eve wanted that his teddy springs up and it works out as expected. This film at that point manages the further existence of John as a grown-up, how Ted turns into a necessary piece of his life and how he influences his own life. This film, as I would see it, doesn't exhaust you and holds you till the end. It is pressed with amusement, sentiment, and some exciting activity as well. Although there are some scenes unsuitable for children, for example, when John and Ted smoke together or there might be some private minutes among Ted and his sweetheart, which gives this film an ""A"" rating yet at the same time I see this film as extremely engaging. The initial segment, Ted (2012), rotates around the life of John Bennett, his relationship with Lori Collins (Mila Kunis) and how Ted unfavourably influences their relationship. The subsequent part, Ted (2015), managed the life of Ted and his relationship with his better half Lynn (Jessica Barth). Right now, the film, Ted likewise faces a personality emergency as the American Government will not consider Ted as a typical individual. Seth MacFarlane has offered a voice to Ted and has likewise coordinated the establishment. His course is excellent remembering that it is his presentation directorial adventure. The screenplay and the story were additionally generally excellent. And if I say something about dialogues then they are very well written. Be it be dialogues of Ted too and the dialogue delivery is also really very entertaining and impressive. This was not the first occasion when I saw a film of Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis cooperating. Separately just as together this pair unquestionably functions admirably. I prior saw them in the film Max Payne (2008), where Mark assumes the title job and Mila assumes the job of Mona Sax. I truly regard these individuals as entertainers a great deal. Seeing a delicate toy come into life is a different encounter for me and I imagine that it would engage all of you as well. Although the film has become very old I think it has not lost its engaging variable. There are many things which we can learn from every movie and that is the case here too but I would state only one thing which I found out to be the most important. It is based on the priorities set by an individual in his or her life. Priorities are dynamic; they never remain fixed. John should have realized the same point. He should have felt that since he is in his 30s or 40s, Ted should not be his prime priority now. I know Ted is his best friend and they are so-called ‘thunder buddies' of each other but they can maintain it but now through a certain distance. He did not realize so which adversely affected his relationship with his girlfriend, Lori Collins and which (though temporarily) spoilt his relationship with Ted, but that's not always the case in real life. Relations in today's world are very tender and need to be taken care of and for that right steps and the right time needs to be taken place to maintain every relation and lead a balanced life. By and large, these two movies, as I would like to think, merit watching work.",Ted,Ted - Movie Reviews

Kyle eventually becomes the most famous sniper in American military history but still with a difficult decisions on his family life and mental health. Bradley Cooper plays a great and believable honest and patriotic soldier, with his performance coming across as believable and perhaps even relatable for some. Clint Eastwood's direction is an evident bonus to the movie and really helps the action sequences and cuts between Kyle's life. What is unfortunate about the movie however is how the trauma of war is almost dismissed in the movie. The health of Kyle is seen and briefly touched upon but fails to ever be truly diagnosed with the cause or a way to help.

6930,Alef M,"Sep 24, 2020","""American Sniper"" é um filme raso, presunçoso, que enaltece a imagem de um homem e, ao tentar desenvolvê-lo, acaba deixando claro quão unidimensional o patriota americano pode ser, aos olhos do roteirista alienado. Clint Eastwood tenta, de todas as formas possíveis, pintar nossa percepção de quem Chris Kyle era. Com um patriotismo exacerbado, um senso de heroísmo que só existe na cabeça de patriotas cegos, uma visão distante da ""lenda"" que ele foi, uma abordagem do ""bem e do mal"" - como se isso justificasse alguma coisa; o filme torna-se artificial, e ao tentar aprofundar os traumas que o protagonista passou, tudo se torna deveras contraditório, pois os temas não são abordados de maneira imparcial ou distante. Fica extremamente claro que a direção quer nois vender uma imagem do protagonista, e ao tentar desenvolver qualquer coisa além desses conceitos, ela falha, tornando-o unidimensional. Há demasiados diálogos expositivos, e eu sei que aqui o proposito era fazer um filme pra todos, mas a obra chegou a um ponto de chamar o publico de burro nos explicando tudo. O senso antagônico criado pelo Sniper adversário é cringe e não funciona, assim como a passagem de tempo existente no filme. Ele passou anos e anos no Iraque, mas a sensação é que ele tá lá há uma semana. O roteiro falha em tentar cobrir toda a vida do atirador de elite, pois nada tem seu tempo de tela desenvolvido, e as coisas acabam se tornando uma bagunça. Ao invés de trazer uma leitura de personagem rica, aqui os produtores decidem trazer uma visão própria de quem foi o Chris Kyle, forçando conceitos a todo momento, falhando em desenvolvê-lo de maneira funcional, alienando os espectadores e enaltecendo uma imagem que os EUA insiste em passar pro mundo.

Now, Tom Cruise is amazing as usual, the action is super well handled especially with the last 45 minutes with the amazing motorcycle chase, the acting is great and the visuals and score are well done and it feels different from the first movie but this movie has awful pacing. This movie should have been the same length as the first but the first hour drags on setting everything up with no action and a stupid love life we do not care about. The villains are also generic and boring with nothing compelling about them and what is up with all the slow-mo shots that occur every 30 seconds during the action and random scenes? It really distracts me out of the movie and not to mention the sound mixing. Why does the score play over the sound effects sometimes? How am I meant to feel tension? Overall, this is a disappointing sequel but fortunately, the 3rd movie is a lot better",Mission: Impossible II,Mission: Impossible 2 - Movie Reviews

There's a lot of fun action sequences during these 123 minutes—though, let's be honest, the movie probably would have only been 90 minutes if John Woo got rid of all the slow motion.

6960,Caleb C,"Aug 30, 2020","MI2 has so much action that happens off screen that it was necessary to use slow motion to make the movie more than an hour long. The misogyny and innuendo has aged horribly and was probably even cringe worthy back in 2000. The finale takes everything great about the MI1 finale and throws it out the window. A bad underground fight sequence is followed by a truly terrible car chase that so blatantly defies the laws of physics that a viewer could not be faulted for thinking it a parody. The final showdown between Hunt and Ambrose is poorly choreographed and relies on a multitude of idiotic decisions by both parties for it to have any semblance of tension let alone happen in the first place.

You can't even tell it's Oscar Isaac under all that makeup so that's the first of many wasted opportunities for this film. For a very large part of the movie Apocalypse just speaks in his own language, which only proves to be extremely annoying. If you want to sit this one out, at least watch the Quiksilver scene on youtube or something because it's probably the saving grace. If the wheels hadn't fallen off the reboot yet, they're completely off in Apocalypse. None of the characters seem to be staying true to their own values. Magneto would let Apocalypse boss him around, really? I highly doubt it. Even if it was about getting 'stronger powers' he would probably just cut and run once he's gotten what he wanted. Apocalypse is a turning point in that you should turn around 180 degrees and watch something else.",X-Men: Apocalypse,X-Men: Apocalypse - Movie Reviews

7014,Puroo R,"Apr 17, 2021","X-Men: Apocalypse is the kind of a movie that will make you remember all the good scenes, and you will forget why you hated it. But when you rewatch it you realise that nothing makes sense. But for me, however, I only came to watch the CGI stuff. I haven't read the source material. Neither do I have any idea about who Apocalypse is and what he wants. So I'm gonna judge this movie entirely based on what happens in it, how the CGI is and how all the characters are. And trust me, it fails in half the things. So first of all, I really liked the idea of an ancient mutant coming out of Egypt to learn about the current affairs and then deciding to take over the world. Though I wouldn't have given any points to this movie for this plot since it's a comic book adaptation, I will still give it extra points for showing it so nicely. Then there was the scene where Cyclops gets his powers. I don't know why, but I used to think this scene was from X-Men Origins: Wolverine. So after that there's a scene where Magneto is shown to have given up his previous life and started living as a family man, but the mutant hunters storm his house and kill his family. I really found that scene emotional. But after that the movie started feeling like it's crumbling down. The same Apocalypse who saves Storm by using sand to cut down everyone's head suddenly decides to never use this power. And also, what is a Storm with a mowahawk even doing in Egypt? It was never said that she's from there. There is a cage match between Warren Worthington III and Nightcrawler, and Mystique comes over there to get Nightcrawler out of there. But it doesn't make sense. How was Nightcrawler even captured in the first place? Couldn't he just teleport out of the cage? Also Mystique is someone completely different this time. I know she can change her look, but even her original look changes. And then there's of course the most iconic scene of this movie: Quicksilver saving all the kids from the explosion! But later on the whole point of that scene gets ruined when the army comes up and captures them anyway. They are transported into a secret lab, and guess what? Wolverine is also there. He was obviously brought in there for a scene that could be shown in the trailer, because then he's gone and lost forever. So anyway, Charles is captured by Apocalypse, the good guys fight the evil guys, something something happy ending and that's it. Most of the scenes in X-Men: Apocalypse were forgettable. The memorable scenes, well, I forgot they were from this movie. To write this review I had to watch Honest Trailers and Cinemasins just to remember what all happened in this movie. Like I said before, I used to think Scott getting his powers in the middle of the class was from X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I thought Quicksilver saving everyone was from Days of the Future Past. Same goes for the getting arrested scene, the Wolverine fight scene - I thought it was all from the prequel. Now I will have to edit my reviews for those movies too.",X-Men: Apocalypse,X-Men: Apocalypse - Movie Reviews

On one hand, the action sequences are really well handled especially the final battle and the Wolverine and Quicksilver scene. They are very creative and very fun and there's some great worldbuilding in this movie with the origins of Apocalypse and combine that with colorful visuals, it's very interesting to see, everyone gives their A-Game performance-wise, it was awesome seeing a young Jean, Storm and Cyclops and this is by far the best Magneto. He's written so well here. On the other hand, Apocalypse is really poorly handled. He's basically just Ultron but with no screen presence, the first half of the movie is just set up for the final battle and just drags on and on with too much going on and it can be frustrating on rewatches and what happened to the nuclear missiles that were luanched and the plot is kind of disappointing for an X-Men movie, still having the thematic elements you expect but leans more to generic teritory way more than any X-Men movie. Jennifer Lawrnece is also shockingly awful here. I liked her in the previous 2 movies but here she screams ‘I don't want to be here'.

However when watching the movie back to back with X-men: Days of Future Past (the best of the entire film series), this movie is actually pretty good and holds to the characters pretty well. Apocalypse is even done pretty well when you get past the lack of stature and his voice. Apocalypse was one of the first mutants and the fact that he can transfer his essence from one mutant body to another, gaining the new mutant ability while retaining his other abilities and extending his lifespan, makes him a very interesting character.

7057,Matthew D,"Sep 05, 2020","Darkly thrilling and pleasantly humorous for a Sherlock Holmes picture. Guy Ritchie's mystery action-comedy Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011) changes the private detective Sherlock Holmes into a crafty boxer, cunning planner, and creative improviser. Ritchie's direction is phenomenally his own with a riveting fast pace and striking use of slowing down the camera and rapid fire cuts from editor James Herbert to keep 129 brief in feel. Ritchie is a fun director with his own unique style as an English auteur, and Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is as funny and exciting as any of his very British pictures. Robert Downey Jr. is outstandingly entertaining as peerless private detective Sherlock Holmes himself. He is effortlessly cool and constantly funny with a calm demeanor displaying cunning intellect. He captures Holmes' meticulous nature with Downey's own freewheeling persona. His chemistry with Jude Law's Dr. John Watson borders on the homoerotic. They pair so well in this movie that I do hope they shoot a sequel together. Law is stoic and upset, yet tender and sincere as the stalwart Watson. Jude Law's man of action gunfire sequences are very cool like Downey's epic boxing duel with Professor James Moriarty, played by the ferocious Jared Harris. Harris' genuinely frightening villain Prof. Moriarty could have gotten him an Oscar as he's absolutely intimidating with his serious gravitas and deep voice. Each line of his is clever and thought out. I'm glad Guy Ritchie cast Jared Harris as the iconic Holmes nemesis. Noomi Rapace is lovely as Madam Simza Heron with her natural locks and formidable action prowess. She's cool and classy with an Earthy feel to her wonderful performance. Noomi Rapace is an actress I need to seek out more of her films for sure. Rachel McAdams makes a dreamy cameo for her devastating part that McAdams plays to perfection. I wish she were in this movie more, but alas, her character serves her purpose. Kelly Reilly is great as Watson's wife Mary Morstan. Her charming personality and clear frustration with getting shoved aside for Holmes is quite entertaining. Michele Mulroney and Kieran Mulroney's script is a tight crime narrative about international and underground dealings and explosive assassinations. Their writing is blissfully funny, truly charming, impressively intricately plotted, and thoughtfully complex as they leave you clues to all the happenings herein, so you never feel too lost. I appreciate their development in making Holmes emotional in losing Irene Adler and Watson destroyed in losing Holmes. Adding Stephen Fry's cheerful, pompous, elitist, and absurd Mycroft Holmes was a nice touch from skilled writers. Philippe Rousselot's cinematography is gorgeous and creative with stunning wide shots of England, France, Germany, and Switzerland alike. His close-ups are striking, but I'd say his medium shots during all the close quarters combat is the most impressive as he clearly details what will happen, then shows us how it all plays out cleanly. Rousselot's camerawork and fast tracking shots during the train shootout and forest bombardment are astonishing feats of filmmaking. It's honestly insane that Guy Ritchie attempted such ambitious action sequences, but they pull it off thanks to Chas Jarrett's special effects supervision, Rousselot's camera whip pans, and Ritchie's careful planning and sheer force of will direction. Sarah Greenwood's production design is very careful and neat in making each period room look accurate and ornate. This film is stylish and fashionable, so of course Jenny Beaven's costumes are sleek and refined as well. Nikita Rae's make-up is realistic and playful for Holmes' disguises. Hans Zimmer's score is blaringly loud and pounds the intensity of each situation into your brain. In all, Guy Ritchie directed a repeat success like a machine pistol firing off a second round in rapid succession.",Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows - Movie Reviews

7065,Preston P,"May 19, 2020","Critics say these movies are examples of ""Style over substance"", further proving the institution to be a joke and a farce. Presence of strong, captivating style does not damn a movie to have no substance, and it's the critics' fault for not being to withstand a strong, pronounced taste. This movie hosts some of the most brilliant action and spectacle of the last decade, while still not sacrificing anything that made Sherlock Holmes loveable in the first place. I'd go as far as to say that few directors and writers understood Holmes better. Many deductions Holmes makes in this movie are right out of the book, and any new ones were written with the same methods as the old ones. The only change these films really made was taking Holmes's loneliness, and his quiet dependence on Watson as a companion, and bringing those aspects to the forefront instead of hanging them in the background like the novels. Also, Watson's occasional bickering with Holmes is fleshed out in this movie. Along with an original plot, these aspects help the movie extend beyond a mere adaptation of the novels, becoming a fresh but familiar reinvention. If you were to read the books, you would see that many of the aspects Critics call un-Holmes like are, in fact, very Holmes like. Anyone of the film critics who said this movie doesn't understand Sherlock Holmes needs to watch less Rathbone, and read more Doyle.",Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows - Movie Reviews

7072,Sean S,"Feb 10, 2020","I always like the bastard child in a film series; A Game of Shadows is the more OCD, less consistent, more creative, brisker and also somehow more protracted, more exciting and bolder entry. It's more flawed but more rewatchable, it's more confusing but it's far less boring. It does bizzare things, like killing McAdams' character so early, and in such a way that is intentionally obfuscated, and it's a deeply messy movie with Ritchie's signature excess, to pave over the cracks in his ability. But RDJ is clearly loving his role and Jared Harris' Moriarty is a fun, if inept, part. The chess match ending sequence(s) rivals anything the British TV show thinks is clever, with a nice nod to the books, and the action has a charged wit and an energy. These films are well tooled machines and I have to say I'd be excited for the cheeky retro-modern escapades in a third entry.

7076,Puroo R,"Jul 27, 2021","I had watched Despicable Me only so that I could finally understand what the whole deal with the minions was. But I ended up liking the movie and all the characters in that. As a result I decided to watch the sequel as well, which I ended up liking even more than the first one. So I thought why not just go all out and watch every single movie? And so I watched this one, and I really I think it was not something really great, although it did manage to do what it was meant to do: give us the laughs and have a good time. Despicable Me 3 is about Gru finding out about his estranged brother Dru who is living a very rich life but does not have the evil nature of Gru and thus is not liked as much by his family. And so grew is forced to take his brother along with him to stop the evil villain Balthazar Bratt, a child actor from the 80s who has faded away with time. Although the minions in this movie are way less than the previous two I don't mind this at all. In fact I kind of found them annoying and I wanted more of the human characters than those yellow Facebook meme sources. Balthazar is my favourite villain from this franchise. All his acts are very funny. Whenever he is on the screen you know you are in for some good time. There are often callbacks to his show which is very campy and has barred CGI according to today's times, which is just like how we see shows from the 80s today. He always dances and plays songs whenever he is out on the heist. It is fun to watch Gru and Balthazar fight in the opening scene and also the way Baltasar dances as he defeats all the guards on the ship. The animation of this movie is way better than the previous two, especially when it comes to the action scenes and car chasing. What this movie lacks in however, is the amount of campiness and cliched moments of having an amateur person come out on a secret mission along with the professional friend/family member. In fact the whole idea of the protagonist having an estranged twin brother is a cliched idea which has been used many times in Bollywood films. Although this isn't a very memorable movie, it does exactly what all the other movies from this franchise do. It is able to create a fantasy world with fun and loving characters who do goofy things and we enjoy them while it lasts. And this is the reason why I don't think this franchise should have more movies. By the time one movie comes we have already forgotten what happened in the previous one. Although I wouldn't say that this is a bad movie, I would definitely say that you would not remember anything other than the good parts once the movie ends, and this is the reason why this movie is so much fun to remember since I don't exactly remember what I didn't like about it.",Despicable Me,Despicable Me 3 - Movie Reviews

The movie has only two major weaknesses that are easy to get past being that there is too many plots and that it relies on juvenile humor and toilet humor more than the last two. However, these are just small flaws and are easy to look past once you see the plots mesh together in a really satisfying way. This movie had some pretty good highlights, like when Gru said his mother told him that his father died of disappointment when he was born as well.

7150,Erin G,"Oct 09, 2021","Cinderella was full of interesting side characters, but if the main characters were a spice they'd be flour. This movie is widely claimed to be an inspiring 'girl power' flick, despite the prince continually sweeping Cinderella up and saving her from everything, the repeated lyric of 'love will save the day' and the prince continuing to pursue her after she turned him down. Cabello's Cinderella is just not the strong independent woman she is advertised as - she is a starry eyed dream girl who floats around waiting for other people to make her dreams come true. The music is comprised of pop songs everyone's already heard a thousand times and original lyrics that frankly make little to no sense. The ending feels sudden and unnatural, with the king's sudden changes of mind, and the story feels off. The dialogue is cringey and the representation is next to nought outside of the dancers and the occasional side character, like the Billy Porter fairy godmother - it feels like he's being used as comic relief or some sort of novel drag queen for the straights to laugh at.",Cinderella,Cinderella - Movie Reviews

However the story is poorly paced. Too many things happen every second before I can even breathe when watching this movie. Aside from the pacing, like critics have said there's not really a moral to it either. I guess it does have some kind of lesson on friendship mostly between Alex and Marty, but it's barely used. And I get the ending was like a follow up to the sequel, but here it doesn't make much sense seeing the animals ditch the zoo and stay in Africa for a while knowing the zookeepers would eventually question it.

I think this is the beat thing he has done that I've seen. Every emotion is in his face. When They say less is more there right his performance is so spot on without all the extra garbage some actors give. The story you can say is like all other zombie movies but that's works because what else would be the story if it was not trying to find out where it came from or how to fight it. The fact that the zombies are fast just gave me anxiety because how would you fight it, they are too fast Unlike typical zombie movies with a walk so slow. I've seen this now about 4 times and I caught something new each time. You have to give Pitt and the director a lot of credit for making such a good film.

7234,Dale R,"Nov 15, 2021","Pixar's first attempt at a princess story is about a Scottish princess named Merida who is at odds with her mother and inadvertently changes her mother into a bear in an attempt to change her fate. The Scottish landscape in the background is beautiful and adding to it some Scottish sounding music really sets the atmosphere of the film really well. The movie begins and ends with narration from Merida that felt to me like it was disconnected from the rest of the story, like they jammed the fate theme in at the last minute. The story is rooted in a lack of communication misunderstanding, and I'm not a big fan of that style of story. The backstory of Mor'du, the big bear, is fascinating and so well conceived they made a short about it. There is definitely enough good stuff in this film to recommend a viewing.",Brave,Brave - Movie Reviews

7240,Jerry S,"Jul 15, 2021","Brave wasn't that bad. The story is not Pixar's best, but it is certainly interesting. The main character Merida is a okay Disney Princess. She's not Belle or heck even Moana. But Merida is just okay. To me there's nothing that interesting about her, that makes her stand out from the rest. However that doesn't mean she doesn't get better towards the end of the movie though. When Merida is with her mother as a bear that's where she starts to get better and the movie starts to get interesting. Brave is at its best when Merida and her mother bear starts to communicate with each other. That's wear the heart and character development comes into play. It shows that the mother really did care for her child but the only reason why she was so strict with her is that she just simply want the best for her. The mother is actually the best character in this movie considering the fact that she does go through most of the development of like I said earlier actually showing that she cares for her daughter. Also I really love how the animation on the bear's facial expression she never talks while she's a bear witch makes it more interesting and engaging to watch. While Brave might not be Pixar's best it still is a charming and surprisingly intense movie. 7.8",Brave,Brave - Movie Reviews

7242,Jacob R,"Jun 27, 2021","This movie isn't as bad as I remember…but I don't think that makes this movie good. First, all the good things. The animation and voice acting, like the majority of the Pixar films, is great. The setting of medieval Scotland is actually a lot more interesting and imaginative that I remember. The monologues\speeches that Merida gives are a little cliche, but still pretty good. And the her shooting for her own hand is easily the best scene from this movie. Now: problems. None of the characters are really done that greatly, but Merida isn't really that good of a person. She keeps blaming a witch for all the problems she has done, and that gets really annoying after awhile. The king and queen are fine, the witch is fine, the little boys are fine, it's really Merida that I have a problem with, that and the villain. Mordu isn't bad in anyway, just kind of boring. The two biggest negative things for me is the story and the twist. The story isn't as cool as it was set up to be in the trailers. I'm sorry, I don't come to Pixar to watch a child and parent disagreement story. If I'm going anywhere to watch that, I'll just rewatch Mitchells vs the Machines again. Now, the twist. It seemed like a good idea on paper, and it comes close in some aspects, but it's not executed as well as it could be. And that's how I would describe the film as well. The good parts are there, but they are just too scattered to make this a good movie. I have to be kinder to it because it had a troubled production, but it's still one of the weaker Pixar movies and easily the worse Disney princess movie ever made, I can't deny that. If you want to say you watched all of them, I guess it's fine. But if you're hoping for a good movie, sadly, I would have to say skip.",Brave,Brave - Movie Reviews

Main character is forced to grow up, take responsibility, and put other's needs before her own. Shows how people can change and how sometimes the people we feel are villains really aren't evil - both mother and daughter are shown as complex humans warts and all. For a change, no one had to die or fall in love for the character arcs to evolve.",Brave,Brave - Movie Reviews
7256,Meydiana R,"Apr 02, 2021","Brave is a 2012 animated comedy-fantasy film directed by Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman.It is the 13th Pixar film,and certainly a great one as their previous. Brave follows Merida the daughter of Scottish King Fergus and Queen Elinor.She is a skilled archer who wants to make her own fate in life and pursue her own dreams.She is then forced to get married,as the tradition requires at a certain age but she is in her own mind and seeks help from a witch to change the fate and be her own person in life. This movie is amazing,from the glorious animation to the characters who are likable just as much as they are interesting.Merida is a strong female lead character who chooses her own path in life and makes her own decisions for herself.She has dreams and most importantly is ""brave"" enough to pursue them till the very end.She's also smart and Kelly Macdonald's voice work just helps the cause with her amazing Scottish Accent. The story is very interesting and intriguing while still being emotional that gives depth to the characters.But it also has funny moments throughout,even though the finale is very dark and also even sad which in my opinion is great. People has been complaining about the twist over and over again and how it is more of a kids film than for adults,which Pixar is used to making.But I disagree because while it is an absolute treat for kids,it is also dark at times,it has adult jokes here and there and what's very important,it has character development at its finest.The place where Merida and different characters in the movie are at the beginning and where they end up is just brilliant and life changing.The lessons they learn through their adventures,them being good or bad,and the way that this movie teaches people that we can make our own fate if we are brave enough to follow our hearts,that makes for an unforgettable experience",Brave,Brave - Movie Reviews

But unfortunately, her mother disagrees leading to quite an unfolding of interesting events that tell a tale of bravery.

7288,Hassan I,"Oct 22, 2021","Irvin Kershner's ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is an ambitious, heartfelt and soulful sci-fi classic that stands the test of time as crowning jewel of the Star Wars franchise. With the second Star Wars film, Kershner took the series in a dark direction by expanding on the timeless themes of the original. Using spellbinding cinematography, Kershner draws viewers into an apprentice's journey towards conquering his invasive enemy in a far-away galaxy. Kershner's decision to employ practical effects over CGI to recreate cartoonish characters pays off tremendously. It lends authenticity and realism to the movie's motion-capture characters missing from recent entries in the franchise. Kershner showcases extraordinary control over production design, action sequences and score, using these elements to create an unforgettable cinematic experience. Lawrence Kasdan's screenplay is also superb, and expertly utilizes cross-cutting storytelling to convey a Jedi's quest towards glory. It's hard to not admire phenomenal performances. Mark Hamill delivers one of his greatest career performances as Luke Skywalker. With spellbinding expressions, he conveys determination, heroism and parental regrets of a novice jedi that struggles to come to terms with his mysterious ancestry. Harrison Ford is equally fantastic in the role of a suave smuggler that relies on wits to outsmart enemies in the galaxy. Ford brings undeniably stylish swagger to one of his most iconic roles that turned him into a star. The final, most noteworthy standout in the cast is James Earl Jones. As the menacing Sith Lord Darth Vader, he brings shades of sympathy to one of the most reprehensible movie villains. Besides technical aspects, the final component of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" that contributes to its success is its message. Unlike other films in the franchise, the movie tackles emotional themes of destiny, legacy and parental regrets that make it the most meaningful Star Wars movie. Nearly 40 years after its release, it remains a sparkling lightsaber whose force inspires movie-goers to trek across galaxies in soaring millenium falcons even if shocking secrets about father figure enemies are written in their phantom of menace destinies.",Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,Star Wars: Episode V -- The Empire Strikes Back - Movie Reviews
7289,Jonathan K,"Oct 15, 2021","The pacing of the middle chunk of this movie is slow; it's deliberate but certainly a bit of a drag when rewatching this movie from time to time. And there -- I've just done the impossible: I just worked out the one genuine grievance I can give to this movie. Beyond that, The Empire Strikes Back is rightfully cemented in the categories of Best Action Movie Ever, Best Sci-Fi Movie Ever, and Best Sequel Ever, as this movie is, beyond my grievance above, about as close to Cinematic Perfection as we may ever see. It explores the hidden depths of A New Hope and actually builds upon it with material that is even more interesting and engaging than in the first movie, and throw in that this is the Second Act movie, where the heroes are at their lowest, this movie features some emotional gut-punches that the first movie simply does not have. While the first movie made Darth Vader a memorable and intimidating villain, this movie escalates him to being possibly the single greatest Movie Villain of all time, as he is not only immensely powerful, he is shown to be smarter and more unrelenting than we (the audience) previously thought. Along with that, the Empire is shown to be more effective than they appeared in the first movie, with the AT-ATs being one of the most memorable Sci-Fi Action creations ever, even if they are a bit impractical. The main thing is that this movie genuinely ramps up the tension of almost every situation because you truly believe, more than in the first movie, that the heroes are often times in genuine danger. This makes the final action sequence the most intense, despite the fact that it's actually the least complex in regards to execution. On that note, the two big setpieces: the Battle on Hoth and the Asteroid Chase, are both absolutely stellar, pun intended, making EXCELLENT use of this sequel's increased budget, alongside some excellent action design. And perhaps the biggest accomplishment of all is that this movie features genuinely impactful emotional beats at the end, with what is easily one of Cinema's greatest twists of all time, and ends on a note of genuine hope, despite an ever-increasing somber and dire tone. It's considered a masterpiece by many because it is a masterpiece, and for what it does, there are almost no other movies in existence that does it as good, let alone better.",Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,Star Wars: Episode V -- The Empire Strikes Back - Movie Reviews

7294,Stephy S,"Sep 14, 2021","One of the greatest sequels in cinema history and without a doubt the best Star Wars movie to date! Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back does everything its predecessor did and so much more. If we go by the criteria of what makes a good sequel, it passes with flying colours. It expands the universe of the original in new and meaningful ways by introducing fresh new planets like Hoth and Bespin and some of the best characters in the entire franchise: Lando, Yoda, Boba Fett and of course Palpatine. It continues the story of the original by taking the next logical step, having Luke face off with Darth Vader and making their dynamic and conflict even more interesting by revealing that they're related. It expands on the themes of the original by showing what the Light and Dark side truly represent and how they differ. And finally, it undoubtedly leaves a positive impact on the franchise by being a masterpiece and being at the center of everything that has yet to come. For how this movie stands on its own, it's magnificent, Luke, Leia and Han all go through excellent arcs and all learn from their mistakes in a way that is interesting and compelling to watch. Darth Vader still has the same presence he had in A New Hope and they set up his return to the light extremely well by having someone more evil than him, making his eventual turn more realistic. The action sequences were a delight to watch, from the battle of Hoth, to the final fight between Luke and Vader, you can't help but marvel at the splendor you're experiencing. The special effects they used were revolutionary, from the usage of paintings to create large, beautiful landscapes to the puppeteering done by Frank Oz, all of it has aged like fine wine. The acting has improved drastically from the original, Mark Hamill is much more likeable as Luke Skywalker and Harrison Ford is more sympathetic but still maintains that hint of contumacious. The chemistry our main trio shared in the original transfers over to the sequel flawlessly, it's even more fun to watch them bicker and argue this time around. Last but not least, this movie's highest of highs is its climax. The fight between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, while not the flashiest fight in the franchise, manages to deliver on a tense fight that holds an immense amount of dramatic weight. Han Solo freezing in carbonite was also something no other movie dared to do at the time, having the heroes lose the battle and have one of the heroes seemingly die was extraordinary and wasn't just there for shock factor as it weaves itself seamlessly into the grander picture.

With its predecessor Star Wars being instantly recognised as a watershed movie and an absolute classic, a follow up film was always going to have gigantic cinematic shoes to fill. Thankfully, new director Irvin Kershner does a marvellous job with Lucas' new story, and the talented team at ILM perform their magic once again to help bring the world of Star Wars back to life. All the cast are reunited in this film, which would not have been nearly as good if any of them had declined to return. The Empire Strikes Back is story evolution, not a repeat of old material or a re-telling of the same story, which is what you get in so many inferior movie sequels. The film's opening sequences firmly establish the two key story arcs in Star Wars - Luke's journey to becoming a Jedi, as well as his relationship to Darth Vader, and Leia's emerging relationship with Han Solo. What follows is high adventure, taking us to incredible new places and introducing fantastic new characters from the Star Wars universe, culminating in another epic fight scene with Darth Vader, but this time against the enthusiastic young Luke Skywalker. The sets, special effects, miniature model work, props and costumes are all faultless, and Frank Oz's puppetry work with Yoda is first rate. John William's masterpiece score shines through again, perfectly encapsulating the mood of each scene. Personally, I much prefer the original theatrical version compared to the modern Lucas cut with added CGI features. It is no surprise that Empire Strikes Back tops the list for many moviegoers, as either the best Star Wats film or even the best film ever.",Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,Star Wars: Episode V -- The Empire Strikes Back - Movie Reviews

No sabiendo equilibrar la balanza entre el público fiel y el público casual, haciendo una mezcla muy extraña. Que aunque en su gran parte, la película es muy entretenida, se siente vacía. No acabas de conectar con los entrañables personajes que todos ya conocemos. Los sentimos apartados de nuestro y su mundo, como si otra franquicia los hubiera pedido prestados. Y me parece que eso reluce cuando la familia sale de Springfield, y se enfocan exclusivamente en ellos, olvidando y quitándole participación a personajes secundarios que muchos hubiéramos querido ver con mas participación en una película de Los Simpson. Me parece que esta película es muy entretenida pero vacía, una película que muchas veces no sabe quienes son los personajes.",The Simpsons Movie,The Simpsons Movie - Movie Reviews

7317,Thomas R,"Aug 29, 2021","I've never really been a fan of ""The Simpsons"", not even during its glory days in the early 1990's, so I can review this movie on its own merits. In fact, I rented it to watch with my girlfriend who likes the show more than I do. She didn't seem to get too excited over it either. Basically, the story is about Homer adopting a pig and causing it to mutate, and he accidentally poisons Springfield's water supply with its excrement. He and his family are run out of town, but soon afterward the EPA learns of this and the Schwarzenegger-like US President is convinced to put a giant dome over Springfield to prevent the pollution from spreading. Homer and his wife and kids, already outside of Springfield, travel around and eventually decide to do something about the dome. Besides its length, the only difference between this movie and any regular Simpsons TV episode is that you get to see Bart's genitalia during the skateboarding scene toward the beginning. This movie has nothing in it for anyone other than Simpsons fans, if even them.",The Simpsons Movie,The Simpsons Movie - Movie Reviews

The Simpsons Movie, coming a few decades after the iconic show had started, is still a very fun film encompassing the main tenants of why the show is revered. Having the whole family and Springfield gang in the film, the citizens have to deal with an environmental disaster, with the Simpson family needing to help change the fate of the city to get things back to normal. Borrowing some themes and storylines from some of its more iconic episodes, The Simpsons Movie does a fairly great job of satisfying long time fans and also new viewers who have never seen the show. Its iconic comedic style of blending biting satire and also classic humour is on display throughout the film. The Simpsons is one of my favourite shows of all time, and it always does a great job of mixing great emotion with its humour. For a show that is so reliant on making episodes that are different from each other, and not following through a long story arc, the film does a good job of creating a story that won't affect any sort of continuity or story arc. Though I do wish it was a film that explored more of Springfield, its still a fun time and a great watch!",The Simpsons Movie,The Simpsons Movie - Movie Reviews

It was the first time I experimented the show's humor, and there are some things that I probably didn't get the first time. However, I must say I had a pretty good time. It has black humor, satire and awesome characters. Now, from another perspective, now that I've started watching the original show, I highly recommend that you watch the show first. Then the film might be more fun... I still don't know if it really captured the show's glory days, but still, pretty interesting and fun. I love the characters and the writing that made this possible.",The Simpsons Movie,The Simpsons Movie - Movie Reviews
7340,Cris K,"Jan 01, 2021","Forgive this forward, but I literally watched all 31 seasons because I was sick and have never understood what the fuss was about the Simpsons. I really have to conclude that the appeal of the Simpsons was a simple lack of options when it first came out, and then it just grew in power by simply existing for so long. For this movie: Uninspired watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend, unless you're already a Simpsons fan. It's really just a lot of the Simpsons being Simpsons, but that also means that the overall story writing is actually pretty good, even if the character writing is rather repetitive. I did enjoy the introduction of Ploppers, Spider-Pig, but it doesn't really even out everything else. The big adversity is an ""under the dome"" scenario, which is actually interesting enough to explore, but because it's the Simpsons, we know that nothing ultimately interesting is going to happen, and that everything is going to resolve like its TV counterpart. Now, that said, the TV show does drop unexpected, unexplainable shifts, like the death of characters. I don't think Fox was brave enough to put such a thing in the movie, which would have completely changed the gravity of the movie. It's fine, it's well produced, it's just not very interesting, and I don't think I'd ever watch it again unless I was binging the Simpsons again, and wanted to watch it in order.",The Simpsons Movie,The Simpsons Movie - Movie Reviews

I loved the philosophical ending. Even if there were inaccuracies and it was not completely Glass’ real life story, this movie was a brilliant “work of art” with strong emotional themes while also a vehicle for environmental and social justice. Although it’s labeled as a Western, there’s a strong sense of Eastern influence like a Samurai quest for honor.

Honestly, there's not too much to say beyond that: It's fun but more somber and serious than I would have liked, the technical accomplishments are quite solid and the cast, while not exactly engaging in highly demanding roles, are generally quite good.

7418,Will C,"Jun 06, 2021","Is this film good? No. But is this film enjoyable? Also no. Shark films have a bit of a notorious reputation for being bad. Just look at titles such as Sharknado, Sand Sharks and the Shark Attack series. With a film like Jaws shining as the example of how good these films can be, none have been able to reach anywhere near that level. While this film doesn't reach the same Marianas Trench depth level of bad as Shark Attack 3: Megalodon, it certainly isn't one of the better shark films (I'm not sure if it'd even make my top 5). There are some fun moments throughout and OTT action sequences. However, this doesn't really make up for the awful dialogue, cringey attempts at humour and overall absurdity of the whole thing. I suppose you can't really expect high art from a giant shark film starring Jason Statham but at least make it enjoyably bad or embrace a darker tone and go for that R rating.

The problem with The Meg is that it tries to tip-toe on the line between the two and fails miserably. Even if you can get past the dizzying camerawork, the frantic editing, and an abundance of dopey dialogue, good luck accepting the idiotic storyline. It's a tale filled with more logic-defying close calls than imaginable and a surprising number of marine biologists who can't seem to stop themselves from falling out of boats.

I could barely watch the final fight scene because I felt so strong second hand embarrassment. Part of what made the first movie so good were the great side characters, Felix and sergeant Calhoun, but they weren't relevant in the sequel. Which would be fine, if they had a good reason to do so and other things to make up for it, but they didn't. Besides, the movie relies too much on references to pop culture.

7452,Puroo R,"Jun 24, 2021","I really liked Wreck-It Ralph back when I saw it. Ever since then I had been waiting for a sequel. Somehow I had a hunch that one will be made. And here it was: Ralph Breaks the Internet. I was expecting it to be something about gaming again but since it was more inclined towards the internet instead of gaming and also seemed to be more targeted towards children than the OG fans, I decided to skip it. Then 2 years ago I suddenly decided to watch it and now I really like it. Of course it's not as good as the original, but that could be said about any Disney movie. Ralph Breaks the Internet is set after the events of Wreck-It Ralph, except that Felix is divorced and Ralph continues to hang around with everyone else outside the games, until the point where he pulls a complete Disney character and ends up breaking Sugar Rush arcade's steering wheel. Now Ralph and Vanellope are out to get the steering wheel from eBay to stop the arcade game from being thrown out. It's what The Emoji Movie could have been like if it wasn't bad. Disney movies always have good animations, those which can make anyone go nostalgic. And here there are several Disney characters shown on the internet in 3D like the Disney princesses (they gave my little one a rush; if you know what I mean XD), MCU characters, Star Wars etc. So in case you wanted to know what they'd look like as 3D animated characters, this is the best place you can see them. The sense of humour was also very good. Character development, however, is the bad part. It was only driven by ""Ralph didn't want to lose Vanellope"". The story isn't that good either; it's plagued with product placement. Plus there are many popular game characters like Sonic (yay!), Eggman, Bowser, Pac-Man ghosts etc. I'd have been happier if the sequel to Wreck-It Ralph was about gaming more instead of the internet, since that's the community among whom the prequel liked. It's a good movie, just not a good sequel. Let's hope the third movie gets back to the roots, since this looked more like a PSA for kids on how to use the internet.",Ralph Breaks the Internet,Ralph Breaks the Internet - Movie Reviews

7455,Anonymous A,"May 29, 2021","This film should've been way better than it was. There were many plot holes, the Disney princess scene was unnecessary feminist propaganda, and the B plot involving the Sugar Rush racers was essentially ignored. Felix and Calhoun were absent for most of the film, Vanellope goes turbo and breaks the rules of the first film, and the characters from the first film are out of character. Ralph suddenly thinks it's ok to unleash a virus in a video game when he fought one to save Sugar Rush in the previous movie upon knowing how dangerous viruses are. Vanellope becomes so selfish that she prioritizes Slaughter Race over saving her game and her people, and the movie doesn't call her out on her actions like it does with Ralph. Also, the Sugar Rush racers were reformed at the end of the first film and each racer had a distinct personality, so there was no need to reduce them to moody 5 year-olds for the sake of a forgotten B plot. Couldn't the directors have instead showcased their reformed personalities and their new relationship with Vanellope and Ralph in a storyline that actually worked for the franchise? As a fan of the first film, I feel as though the writers forgot everything that had happened in the first film. I was sorely disappointed with this unworthy follow-up and only consider the first film canon.

The only decent scene was the Disney princess scene and even then I'm pissed off that they white washed Tiana but I'll just say it's because of lighting and animation differences.

This one has Poseidon/Neptune (Gaffigan), the Kraken/Kaliyanaag (also the symbol for cryptocurrency fyi), and the caduceus/staff of Mercury/Kundalini. The moment with the Kaliyanaag-Kraken is straight out of Hindu mysticism, as the Krishna stand-in (Sandler's Dracula) dances on the head of the sea monster to stop it from eating everyone. This is about the sea people (Ericka/Poseidon-Neptune) versus the monsters running the dream sand hotel, and can't we just all get along? Apparently we can. The filmmakers just don't show the marriage between these camps, as the movie wraps with no sign of Ericka, and yet there is an engagement on the table...",Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation,Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation - Movie Reviews

I hope the 4th installment in the franchise won't disappoint me. also the relationship of denis and winnie was so cute in hotel transylvania 2, but guess what 3 does? ruin the relationship! instead of being the cutest relationship, denis begins to be uncomfortable. i would understand if they pointed out why denis was like that to winnie, it would be a pass, but this movie doesnt care and wants to be its own movie",Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation,Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation - Movie Reviews

The way the new characters looked was very enjoyable too. The music in this one didn't feel like it was just randomly thrown in, it was written to be in the movie. The music overall was very catchy, well known, and fun. It almost makes you feel like you want to get up and dance. Out of the three movies, this one had a proper plot and a villain that had a backstory. It felt like the characters had a purpose; defeating the villain. I also enjoyed the idea of giving each character something to do in this movie. Just like the other two, this film had some jokes that weren't quite laugh out loud, and others which older kids+ wouldn't be amused by.

7505,"Apr 15, 2020","Alright, I’m done with these movies. My wife likes them for some reason, but I am so sick of this nonsense. The first Hotel Transylvania was terrible, the second had some moderately redeeming qualities, but this third chapter is just irritating. I cannot take any more of that stupid voice Adam Sandler uses for Dracula. In small doses it can be kind of funny when he uses it in a live action film or when he’d use it back on SNL, but he pulls that obnoxious stuff for the entire runtime of these movies. The humor of monster things in place of their human versions is so overplayed at this point, and that’s really the only jokes they have for this film. I guess there are a few moments of physical comedy that work, simply because I like watching these characters’ hurting, but that’s about it. The plot is so predictable that I literally called it within less than 10 minutes, and my wife got mad that I was spoiling the movie. It doesn’t help that they have a completely irrelevant opening sequence that tips their hand so even a small child could probably guess who’s going to be the villain in the story. They attempt to include some subplots in Hotel Transylvania 3, yet they manage to make them so insignificant and pointless that I couldn’t understand why they were included. Like the little kids bringing a giant dog. Was there a point to this other than having the dog there to help out a little in the final scene? What about the stupid family of 5000 wolves? Nope, just an occasional aside to remind us that they have some time without their obnoxious furballs. Even the climax is moronic, as it drags on for way too long, and I kept begging for it to stop. Then it ends with a lame pop culture reference that is older than most of the kids who enjoy these awful movies. Writing this kind of bad film-making off as a mindless kids’ movie no longer flies with me. There have been too many great movies that appeal to young children, but also are solid enough to keep adults from ripping their hair out. This kind of bargain basement nonsense is barely good enough to qualify for a direct-to-video release. I would recommend everyone avoid Hotel Transylvania...all of them!",SHOW MORE,Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation,Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation - Movie Reviews

7517,John M,"Oct 29, 2021","I guess we are back. So Tim (James Marsden) is no longer a child threatened by his infant brother Ted (Alec Baldwin). Tim has a family of his own now: a wife (Eva Longoria) and two daughters (Ariana Greenblatt, Amy Sedaris). One of his daughters is a boss baby in her own right, and she makes Ted enter the picture again to stop a plot involving babies eliminating parents. Of course, there is no other way to counter this but to have the two brothers take a serum that will turn them back into children again to infiltrate a school headed by a nefarious principal (Jeff Goldblum), and yes, I am well aware of how insane this sounds. Now I was pretty neutral on the first Boss Baby. I thought it was passable, but I never for one minute thought it was something you could build a series upon. Hollywood is going to Hollywood, and when something overachieves with financial success, you're going to go back to the well until it runs dry. Rest assured, in case you couldn't already figure it out: that was a bad call. To me, this is a prime example of everything Dreamworks regularly catches flack for. It's too much emphasis on cheap visual gags, it is chaotic, and they don't spend more than the bare minimum amount of time needed to pen a script. I mean really, just go back and reread my attempt at a plot synopsis to identify that writing was never a point of emphasis. An assumption was made by the creators that their intended audience has ADHD, so they opted to make a story that perpetually crashes forward with reckless abandon like the boulder in Raiders of the Lost Ark. The animators are overexcited, and the kids in this will frequently move like the villain in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 for no reason at all, which was something that I frequently found to be grating. Even before I hit the halfway point of this, this movie had made me physically tired. I'm not even exaggerating when I say that it made me feel like I should have just gone to bed early to catch up on some sleep. The most frustrating thing I found about this is that when it calms down to let everyone breathe for a moment, there are some sweet moments to be had. There is a father-daughter bonding moment with music that I think worked quite well around the midpoint, and I could have used a lot more of that throughout. Granted, I can count these sweet moments on one hand, which is why I can't award more points than I would like to. I don't know how preteens will react, but I think that only the youngest of audiences will get anything out of this. I predict that everyone else will grow weary the longer this goes on, and I can't say that I blame them. This is a movie that should have been scrapped in preproduction if we are being completely honest, and the creative integrity featured is nothing more than a handful of scraps at the most. The Boss Baby: Family Business is a cash grab that is not worthy of your time.",The Boss Baby,The Boss Baby: Family Business - Movie Reviews

Upon first viewing, this movie can be needlessly confusing, which is nothing new for a Nolan film but where movies like Interstellar, Inception, or Memento can benefit from being a little confusing forcing the audience to figure it out themselves. But a war film like Dunkirk doesn't really benefit from this style of storytelling, it's a very suspenseful movie at times but loses all of that by not delivering on any consequences for the characters.",Dunkirk,Dunkirk - Movie Reviews

It's not the war fought by heroes, but that of ordinary people. It captures the fear and suspense any ordinary man has, as the characters panic and hold on for dear life.

Critics constantly hound Nolan for his weak dialogue, and Dunkirk largely foregoes dialogue in favour of atmosphere to the film's benefit. The cast sink into their roles with efficacy. Who would have expected Branagh to star alongside Harry Styles? Nolan maintains the suspense throughout the entire process by delivering varied angles of the titular event, but mentions must go to Zimmer's score and Van Hoytema's cinematography. The director's practical effects and other trademarks for visual flair mean that Dunkirk always remains interesting and often excels through splendid cast, pacing, and ambition.",Dunkirk,Dunkirk - Movie Reviews

7573,Kasidit T,"Jul 31, 2021","This film was utterly absorbing and brilliant. Eschewing many of the standard war-film creative devices, ""Dunkirk"" delivers an immersive and realistic recreation of the 1940 Dunkirk evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force during the fall of France to the Nazi Blitzkrieg onslaught. From the very beginning of the film, the audience is thrown right into the fray of three storylines revolving around the evacuation and never truly allowed a rest. From dodging German bullets in the streets, cowering from dive-bombers on the beaches, and having ships sink from under us, to sailing to Dunkirk as a civilian volunteer, to flying a Spitfire fighter trying to protect the operation from German aircraft, the legend of Dunkirk is explored superbly. The immersion is very much helped by the film being shot at Dunkirk itself in the ground storyline, on open water for the sea storyline, and in the air with genuine World War II warbirds in the air storyline. There are some elements that detracted from the film, however. Director Christopher Nolan's aversion to CGI makes the filmed experience impeccable but forces the film to include a Dunkirk far too intact and clean than it was in real life, anachronistic ships, and too few men to truly resemble the real Dunkirk. Nonetheless, the film captures the terrifying and intense atmosphere excellently.",Dunkirk,Dunkirk - Movie Reviews

7578,Jeff W,"Jul 17, 2021","I watch a film every day. I love films. It's been my thing since I was a kid. I remember when my mom bought me a DVD player for my bedroom when I was a teen, before most people had one in their living rooms. I say that because as a someone who loves film it's hard to explain to people the difference between films you like, films you love, and films you feel people have to see. I try not to waste people's time so I choose to mention the last category. Dunkirk is such a film. I need to carefully choose where to start. Why do I love this film? For starters there is how unusual it is. Upon watching this film you may not notice but this is one of the weirdest war movies ever made. Most war films have large battle sequences. Dunkirk is a character driven film set during a war. Think ""Saving Private Ryan"" (another film everyone must see,) but as a suspense thriller character piece where the war is outside the story. This film only wants you to care for the characters and not the action. It's weird, it's contradictory to studio thinking, and it's counter productive to any film maker looking to make money, but it is genius. The second thing I love is the time jumps. Upon first watching this film I didn't understand the time jumps and I didn't fully appreciate the film. It's actually three films. It's a film about a port which takes place during the course of a week. It's a film about a boat captain going to rescue troops which takes place during a day. Last, it's a film about a fighter pilot which takes place during an hour. This is Nolan. Every film Nolan manages to bend time and perplex his audience during at least a couple of sequences. This time he does it for the entire film. The last thing I love about this film is the characters and the themes. This isn't a war film that glorifies war. This isn't a film about heroes, even though there are a couple. This is a film that shows human beings in a situation where they will most likely die and it revels in the tension and passions that rise up from such a situation. This is one of the finest scripts ever filmed carried by some really great performances. Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh, even fucking Harry Styles is knocking it out of the park. This movie has some amazing acting in it and it's backed up by an amazing director with an amazing script. See this movie.",Dunkirk,Dunkirk - Movie Reviews
7579,JOHN U,"Jul 01, 2021","Dunkirk: Hope in the midst of loss. This week I'll be taking a look at the stunning war film Dunkirk. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, it features a large ensemble cast including Fionn Whitehead, Tom Glynn-Carney, Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh and Tom Hardy. The film recounts the historical events of the evacuation of the French town of Dunkirk after it had been surrounded by the German forces, trapping more than 400,000 British soldiers on the beaches. The narrative follows three different perspectives of the event; young soldiers trapped on the beach, one of the many civilian vessels that sailed toward Dunkirk on a rescue mission and two pilots trying to protect British ships from German Luftwaffe planes. The thing that struck me the most from the outset of this film is the incredible technical achievement that it is and especially in nonlinear visual storytelling. The editing especially is so precise, well paced and consistent that even though the three story lines are happening at different times and sometimes even overlap, the flow of the narrative is never confusing or very hard to follow. Using barely any computer generated effects, there was no cheating on the structure and flow of the film's visuals and it presented a unique challenge to the editing team. Incorporating a complex element of balancing a weeks worth of action for the land, a day for the sea and an hour for the air added to the list of unique challenges bringing the film together would pose. Overall I was struck by how great the post production was on this film and how necessary being great was for the film to actually work. Making a film that breaks so many narrative rules and structures into a powerful yet still entertaining blockbuster is a feat that only spot on editing could have accomplished. Large and sweeping in scope while maintaining a sense of dire urgency and dread, the film deftly balances it's numerous elements to create a truly engrossing and moving experience. With time running out and losses getting heavier, the film portrays the situation that the men of Dunkirk had to go through by telling the fictional stories of three different groups and stirringly portrays their struggle to keep their courage and hope alive in the face of death. Dunkirk creates it's tense and desperate setting by a relentless mix of pace, music and encompassing cinematography. Hans Zimmer provides a score that is jarring in many respects. As he did in Interstellar, Zimmer departs from the tropes common to the scores of the genre and definitely does not create a score that invokes the period. He instead provides a musical wall of low foreboding synthesized textures that conveys the feelings of desperation and fear in the soldiers with raw upfrontness. Also like Interstellar, the sheer weight and power of the score and the way Nolan often pushes it to the forefront might be a cause for a headache or simply feeling overwhelmed but this is definitely not because the music or score itself is bad but because it is doing precisely what it is meant to do. The job of the score is not always a pleasant one and while it is true that blending the music seamlessly with the background is usually the best way to convey the subliminal message music sends, sometimes to convey the intensity and overwhelming nature of the film one is watching, a score equally as intense and in your face is required. The gorgeous cinematography in the film also conveys the spirit of intensity while maintaining impressive visual quality. Filmed almost entirely on Imax cameras and without a single frame composed entirely digitally, the film team had their work cut out for them on this film but under the masterful leadership (and often camera handling) of cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, a sense of epic scale is achieved alongside the tensity of the action. The camera never cheats in this film because it never has anything to hide. So much was built practically and shot in camera that the action could be displayed as it is without having to cover things up with visual tricks. The feel of the camerawork places the audience in the story in a very immersive way while still maintaining a tight sense of dread. Shot in natural lighting and sometimes in very tight and constricting spaces, the cinematography is sometimes breathtaking, always wide in scope and captures tension in a unique and bold way. Another element that sets Dunkirk apart from a common war film is it's lack of dialogue and short runtime. Nolan expressed that from the very beginning of the film he wanted it to have a third act feel. To place the audience in the situation with the characters with no lead up or back story other than a few words of text on the screen and a leaflet falling from the sky. Dunkirk succeeds in it's gutsy attempt to create a film that is ""all third act"" with it's carefully crafted narrative acting as a strong skeleton for the rush of non-stop terror, action, movement and emotion that it pours out. With innovative tactics of yesteryear blended with distinctly original and modern storytelling and style, Dunkirk creates a visceral experience of a historic event that is to be revered and remembered as its subject matter should be. The miracle of Dunkirk is an example of the human spirit to not lose hope in the face of death. Dunkirk was ultimately a defeat and yet at the same time a victory. This paradox is what makes the event so fascinating and makes the film so worthy of scrutiny. There is more to the hope in the soldiers and civilians of Dunkirk then just a belief that they will survive; there is also a more realistic hope, a more courageous hope that even if they face danger or death that they will be able to do some good with the situation. The people of England never thought to give up in the face of their defeat but put all of their efforts into an seemingly impossible task of enlisting hundreds of civilian ships to evacuate 300,000 men. Because of their stubborn hope they won a victory in the midst of their defeat. One may look at the situation as a whole and say that England simply eluded being annihilated and that no military advantage was gained in the event, for the people and the spirit of England, having their boys home safe was good enough and the film definitely portrays that side of the story. It doesn't pretend like Dunkirk was not a devastating loss, one of the final shots is of the pilot Farrier being taken prisoner by the Germans, but it does recognize and convey the spirit of Dunkirk and convey that spirit of unquenchable hope that was so important to the people of the time and is important for us who remember. However, the question in war is rarely ""what can I do?"" but ""how can I do it?"". In other words, the opportunity to do good and to be brave abounds but day to day choices become much more difficult. Risks still exist and every choice may cost you, another, or both of you your lives. In the film, in all three storylines, the main characters take every situation and try to do the most honorable thing they can. It doesn't always work out for the better for them, but others are affected and no deed goes without an outcome. In times of war, sticking to a true north may be the only way to keep one's head level and make the right choices, in the film, the characters stick to a code of honor that keeps them grounded while the horror of war swells around them. Another weighty topic the film addresses that the context of the story suggests is the value of lives over the strategic blow of a defeat. To clarify, I realize that escape was the only option at Dunkirk and that defeat was inevitable but at the end there is not a sense of defeat even though many British vehicles, supplies and lives were lost. The simple fact is that the leaders in England understood the real thing that needed saving and put all of its effort into making the best of a bad situation and in so doing made a bad situation good. The events of Dunkirk, and the film especially pose a dangerous battle between hope and desperation. Only by keeping hope alive was that good achieved. Near the beginning of the film the main character Tommy sits on the beach and observes a soldier that has given into despair and walks into the sea, drowning himself. The battle between hope and despair is so dire in wartime and especially in the situation of Dunkirk because despair is self destructive and speeds you on your way to death, while hope is a driving force to keep going through that fear into life. There can be no middle ground. Even with minimal character development, dialogue or time to reflect, Dunkirk still delivers much to be thought about afterwards and a lot of deep meaning to be unpacked. One of the more brilliant aspects of this film is the way it deals with character. With barely time to remember their faces and not enough dialogue to remember their names, some may find it hard to empathise with their stories. However, this approach is entirely intentional and is not a product of lazy or poor writing. By giving the audience no background and minimal introduction to the numerous characters in the three storylines, I believe Nolan is doing two things, by not devoting any time to the introduction of his characters he is trying to make the possibility of their deaths much more believable. It is an almost universal understanding that if the main character dies he or she will die at the end. Anything before that doesn't hold any weight or stakes because the film is about them and usually has devoted so much time to their introduction and characterization. In Dunkirk, each man is simply another soldier among the thousands who may get lucky once, but might not get lucky again. The other thing that points to the intentionality of the overall ""facelessness"" of the main characters is that the reality is that Dunkirk is the story of thousands and thousands of individuals and to limit the narrative to focusing intently on a few would be to narrow the subject. Nolan portrays each place where Dunkirk was lived out, on the sea, in the air and on the beaches but by keeping his characters fictional and vague he is evoking the universality of the event and almost making it allegorical. Each character is almost meant to represent the entirety of their group and the experiences and feelings that each group had. Using this tactic, Nolan is attempting to not water down the events, but put them into an even more poignant spearhead. In this allegorical way each main character gives an example of the spirit of the film. George, Peter and Mr. Dawson all push faithfully on toward Dunkirk, saving two soldiers on the way and press on even when it seems pointless to do so. Tommy defends the life of the French Gibson when he is threatened to leave the rapidly sinking boat that hides them from the enemy. Even though he lied about his identity and even though Tommy knows that someone must leave the boat or they will all die, Tommy insists, risking his own life in the conflict. Farrier chooses to turn around and defend a ship full of fugitives even when his fuel is critically low and he ultimately gets captured on the beach but saves many lives because of his decision. Even Colonel Bolton makes a sacrifice of courage when he opts to stay on the beach and risks his life to oversee evacuating the French troops after the bulk of British forces had been evacuated. Each character represents the courage and spirit of the men at Dunkirk in a way that we might not remember their character specifically, but we will remember what they have done. Dunkirk is a riveting and relentless experience that is not only a testament to good filmmaking, but also a testament to a historic event that should never be forgotten. Nolans standards for filming as much as possible for real and his technically challenging script pushed the filmmakers to their limits in editing, sound design, production design, music, the whole works. The film puts thought provoking messages and themes into its narrative while still maintaining a fast pace and all the stylings of a thriller. Choosing more archetypal characters rather than his usual flawed central characters, Nolan quite intentionally disconnects the narrative from any specific person to create a more comprehensive account of the massive event that was Dunkirk. The film captures the spirit of what Dunkirk was with surprising clarity. The final scene speaks especially poignantly as Tommy reads Winston Churchill's address to the English people after their troops had been returned safely home. Churchill's famous speech where he promises ""we will fight them on the beaches"" holds an all new meaning as a message of hope and resolve plays over the aftermath of each storyline. In the midst of pain and tragedy, fear and terror, loss and pain, Dunkirk emerged as a beacon of hope for the war to come. As this film reminds us of that, it also stands as a beacon of great filmmaking, the innovation, massive amount of organization in its making mirror its subject matter and deliver a moving and awe inspiring experience.",Dunkirk,Dunkirk - Movie Reviews
7580,Matthew L,"Jun 29, 2021","MINOR SPOILER ALERT Dunkirk is an exceptional film that deserves all the praise that it's received! It may be one of my favorite war films that I've seen, but to be frank, I haven't seen that many war movies, and I know that in this film is especially tame in terms of gore, but I kind of liked that because it forced you to focus more on everything that was happening and being felt by the soldiers, scared of death and full of suspense and awkward silence. The film really excelled in many different areas. I'll first comment on the acting, which was probably the most underrated element of this film. One must remember that these actors were given very little to work with, but they were able to communicate so much through body language and facial expressions. The jealousy of being unable to get on the boat, the need to remain calm under extreme pressure, the feelings of traumatic stress, etc., were all expressed very convincingly and only through a few lines of dialogue and everchanging faces. While it's definitely not the best acting ever, I do think it's worth mentioning because of how little the actors were given in the first place. Cinematography and editing were just beautiful, definitely the best parts of the film. I was surprised to find out that it did not win Best Cinematography at the Academy Awards, but I haven't seen Blade Runner 2049 so, what do I know? All I can say is that the scenes shot in the air and on the water were some of the most beautiful scenes I've seen yet (though I am saying this as someone relatively new to cinema). One scene in particular, where the one fighter's plane just glides along the beach of Dunkirk, and we see Dunkirk's landscape as the plane gently falls, seemed so realistic and breathtaking I thought I was in the plane myself! Needless to say, I was extremely impressed. In terms of direction and screenplay, I thought that Nolan did a great job. I liked his unique take with the film, and I thought that the absence of dialogue had Nolan's intended affect, which was to ultimately incite the same sense of fear and silent hope that the soldiers had experienced in the viewers. Nolan's direction is unconventional in that this is supposed to be an action-war type film, but what makes it work is the fact that it does have a decent amount of action and suspenseful scenes, yet everything has much more solemnity so the film is more grounded and realistic. There were very few things that I disliked about this film; the theme of nationalism sort of annoyed me because that's kind of why they were in the war in the first place, and at times the film could be a tad bit boring, though not as much as I expected it to be. Ultimately the reason why I decided not to give this film the full five stars is because it honestly didn't completely amaze me and it's definitely not something I'd casually watch again, but still, I'd recommend it to friends.",Dunkirk,Dunkirk - Movie Reviews

7582,Mauricio D,"Jun 24, 2021","Dunkirk is a combination of three narratives going on that end up merging together. The nonlinear storyline helped to add to the anxiety & uncertainty. I found it genuinely stressful from the opening to the closing sequence and there's so much that your senses are never even given a break. More like an experience of true horrors of war showing that war is not about some brave personalities with weapons. It's about nameless and faceless soldiers facing an existential crisis, the possibility of randomized death, and how they can either respond with despair or hope. Hans Zimmer's terrific use of sound also puts you right there in the middle of the war and some of the sound effects were so real that you couldn't help but feel as if you were right there which provides you an intense experience of death. Christopher Nolan shows again why he's an important phenomenon in films today. His work is experiential, his screenplay is more action than words. The class this man brought to movies is unmatched by any other filmmaker in recent times.",Dunkirk,Dunkirk - Movie Reviews

The three individual plots are great enough, but how they meet up is just great. Another thing that is great is the action, which is probably accurate to what was happening at the time, which is nice. Speaking of facts, to my knowledge, the movie is pretty accurate. Also the cast is just great. Like dude, you were able to put Harry Styles into the movie and make it work. That's not suppose to happen!!! Also the big name stars do their job well as well. But there's one problem to this near flawless film, which is the characters. The actors playing these people are great, but the characters really aren't. Like they're not bad per se, just….forgettable. I literally watched this movie a hour ago and I don't remember any of the characters names, except for Georges, the only reason being that he dies in a weird way. Sure, you can have a great story, but none of it is going to matter if you don't have memorable characters, which Dunkirk doesn't have. Besides that, it was nominated for best picture for a reason. If you can deal with a movie with very little in the character department (like myself), then this has to be on the top of your list.",Dunkirk,Dunkirk - Movie Reviews

7591,Yassine B,"May 27, 2021","Dunkirk is an war action movie directed by Christopher Nolan and released in July 2017. The mains characters are Tommy(played by Fionn Whitehead) Peter(Tom Glynn-Carney) and Colonel Winnant(James D'Arcy). The movie takes place in Dunkirk during the Second World War. It tells the story of the evacuation of British and French troops under enemy's fire. This evacuation was a success with the help of civilians boats. The plot is a little bit difficult to understand because their is no explanations during the movie. Why have to guess were the movie take place, when. But this make the movie very unpredictable. After that, I would say that the movie is very absorbing. It's easy when you watch the movie to identified yourself to the characters because there is a lot of different personalities. The visual effects are very outstanding and make the movie even more realistic. This movie cost 150 M $ so it's an high budget movie. Photography is impressive. There is a lot of different filming technics used in the movie. The acting was very natural and realistic. Actors are really thinking like real terrified soldier doing everything do save there lives. The script is very realistic with a little part of inexplicable. It is also moving and spectacular. It's a real blockbuster. To conclude, I found this movie very realistic and absorbing.

7593,Jonathan K,"Apr 19, 2021","I will certainly give points for creativity in regards to this movie (or..episode?), and I will acknowledge that the opening several minutes is actually legitimately quite chilling, watching Godzilla destroying the world with literally nothing able to stop him. However, the movie dips in quality fast and hard shortly after, and never really rebounds at all. In fact, when this first movie was over, I legitimately wanted to know if the writers were intentionally trying to make me angry by writing a movie that's as frustrating to watch as possible. For starts, let's go with the fact that the humans return to Earth and everything is literally so deadly, that even if Godzilla was taken out of the mix, ""Hell on Earth"" would barely begin to describe it. There's literally 10,000 mini-kaiju for every human, and the plants cannot be eaten as they are literally as hard as steel, so as a viewer, you really start to wonder: ""What are you even trying for?!"" Even if the heroes completely win every objective they strive for, they still lose in every conceivable way regardless, so when they fail to achieve pretty much every objective anyway, it feels less like a compelling drama and more like the kaiju-cinema equivalent to watching a long video of a dog stuck wedged between two rocks. This is made worse by the fact that the main characters are universally either completely flat or outright unlikable, with the central protagonist being the biggest offender. He's nihilistic and embittered (to put it lightly) but he's also somewhat self-righteous, and honestly I wouldn't follow him if I were one of the nameless, faceless people in the movie, even if the situation was significantly less bleak. And lastly, the movie gives us some entertaining sci-fi action against Godzilla at the end, which would be fun if not for it being a massive tonal shift from the rest of the movie, as well as the realization that every human unit is irreplaceable -- Like, normally, watching Godzilla take on a group of tanks and jets is a lot of fun, but when the entire world's military is just 10 jets and 20 tanks, you can't just casually watch him take these units out; the gravitas does not allow for it. And honestly, all of these just culminate in a movie that just made me drained by the end, as there were too many frustrating elements that I legitimately stopped caring altogether well before the climax. It's sad because the story starts from a really solid premise, and while not exactly excellent, the animation is of solid quality, with one of the more interesting concepts of Godzilla seen to date (like...he looks like he's made of tree-bark or something), but due to a fair number of central miscalculations in the story's development, it ended up becoming what I would easily call the least enjoyable Godzilla (Proper Godzilla at least) movie ever made.",Godzilla,Godzilla: Monster Planet - Movie Reviews

The new creatures the Servum are really interesting new monsters in the franchise, including Godzilla Filius basically serving as the spawns of Godzilla Earth and I love the new design and history on Godzilla. Rather than basing it on reptiles just like previous incarnations of the character, they made him into a plant and I can see where the Anime filmmakers were going which I'm glad they went for that. The only main issue is with the main character Hauro Sakaki who resembles two characters, Eren Yeager, and Anakin Skywalker which it sounds like they're taking the original attitude from someone's characters.

I miss his stable of charismatic monstrous friends and foes, sending crowds fleeing in terror from their thunderous confrontations. Something got lost over the years, and it seemed to peak at the turn of the new millennium. The 1998 Roland Emmerich American version may not have done the radioactive beast any favours in corrupting his appearance and behaviour, pushing fans to call him Gino (Godzilla In Name Only), but one could say that Godzilla ultimately was killed for good by the puerile mess that was Ryuhei Kitamura's GODZILLA FINAL WARS in 2004. It took 12 years for the massive creature to reappear on Japan's shores, of course after Gareth Edward brought the beast back in 2014 in another American iteration of Japan's favorite Kaiju, in a film that promised a lot but offered little to be excited about. SHIN GODZILLA was a mixed bag to be certain. While it served a rather clever sociopolitical satire of Japan's stifling bureaucracy (something Shusuke Kaneko had already explored beautifully in his 1998 remake of GAMERA) and an eerie comment on the recent Fukushima disaster, Godzilla himself was a mere shadow of himself. Ponderously plodding across the Japanese countryside, stiff and monolithic, he was now a mere symbol for man's folly and destruction, harking back to the 1954 film that started it all. A noble intention, but lacking the sense of menace the original Ishiro Honda directed classic conferred to the Big G. Arguably, I would say that Shusuke Kaneko (him again) managed to create a more intensely savage and terrorizing beast in the 2001 monster mash GODZILLA, MOTHRA AND KING GHIDORAH: GIANT MONSTERS ALL-OUT ATTACK. Nevertheless, the film's social commentary helped the film achieve critical and box-office success in Japan, triumphantly bringing back the creature to his home turf. Which brings us to GODZILLA: MONSTER PLANET, (Hiroyuki Seshita, Kobun Shizuno) which is the first feature length animated film featuring Godzilla (we will not mention the embarrassing 1978 Hanna-Barbera cartoon series, or the 1998 animated Spin-off of the Emmerich film). The film has a very intriguing premise: Earth has been devastated by Godzilla and his monstrous ilk, forcing humanity to escape to space, in search of a more habitable planet. Their quest bearing no fruit, and their life support running low, they decide to come back to their home planet, hoping that the 10,000 years that has passed on Earth since their departure will have left behind a less hostile world waiting for them. I think the title of the film points out this hope is crushed under a gigantic radioactive foot. Sporting a gorgeous animated style, mixing adeptly a more classical style of animé with computer animation, the film is lovely to look at without a doubt. The music by Takayuki Hattori (who had previously scored GODZILLA VS SPACE GODZILLA and GODZILLA 2000) is appropriately bombastic, evoking Akira Ifukube's work on the original series.So the film SOUNDS good too. The film exploits poorly its promising classic science-fiction premise, though, preferring to focus on the tired cliche of Captain Ahab obsessed by his own white whale. The main character Haruo Sakaki elicits little sympathy with his constantly breathless snarling performance, and his ill-fated quest for revenge endangers many hundreds of his compatriots. He is surprisingly delivered command of a mission to destroy Godzilla based on a plan that is reminiscent of the rebel's scheme to blow up the Death Star in STAR WARS. Tensions between the characters is kept at a strict minimum, to help propel the fragile script by Gen Urobuchi along at a pace that is still quite a bit deliberate. Even then, little time is spent on how life could be sprung forth anew on this future Earth where only fossils of its once great structures remain and where monsters dwell. This being the first in a proposed trilogy, one can only hope this aspect will be explored further in the following chapters. Will I feel compelled to watch them is the question. As for the true star of the film, he is sadly no different in characterization from SHIN GODZILLA's lumbering lifeless husk, heavily wrecking havoc with little signs of conscience of his surroundings. More plant than animal, he most likely is meant to represent literally a force of nature (something not new in the 64-year-old series) which rips away any chance of being more than a growling allegory. By doing so, there is a somewhat pretentious attempt to make Godzilla relevant again, like SHIN GODZILLA did a year prior. But should it come at the expense of his identity that he developed over the last 60 plus years? I'm not asking for him to dance a victory jig like in INVASION OF THE ASTRO-MONSTER, or entertain conversations with his fellow monsters with the help of word balloons as he did in GODZILLA VS GIGAN. But surely there is a way to portray him as a living being with emotions and even motivations and still keep a sense of that precious symbolism alive. There is no need to make him into this grandiose empty vessel, only meant to carry the weight of his crushing metaphors. Sigh… I miss Godzilla.",Godzilla,Godzilla: Monster Planet - Movie Reviews
7600,Dean T,"Jun 01, 2020","You would think that Godzilla & Anime would go together like chocolate and peanut butter...but this isn't a very good one in all honesty. I will admit that there are a lot of really great ideas, the world building is solid, the animation is good, & the score is decent...but literally everything else falls flat on its face. The movie actually starts out great where the situation with the kaiju is DARK, like ""end of the world"" dark...but it has way too much technobabble and very little action. I will admit that when you finally see Godzilla at the end of the movie and it is AMAZING; he really feels like a God this time, annihilating the humans and aliens with so little effort.

So depressing, pointless and nothing anyone wants to see for entertainment.",FLAG THIS REVIEW,Godzilla,Godzilla: Monster Planet - Movie Reviews
7602,Chris M,"Jan 02, 2020","I preface this by saying I'm a big fan of two particular Japanese exports: anime and Godzilla. They each have their problems but they both have a range of pros that keep me coming back to watch more, whether its the creativity and artistic freedom a popular animated medium like anime allows or the basic nature of a guy in a giant monster suit crushing little model buildings and fighting other guys in other suits. When it comes to Godzilla Monster Planet (or as Netflix is showing, Planet of the Monsters. I'll hearby refer to it as Godzilla Earth as that's what I've known it as until now) it seems to have just brought all of the negative points from one aspect of its foundation. Firstly, the positives. The creature design is fairly good actually, by far the best part of this production. It's more akin to the Legendary Godzilla design of the more recent Western movies than the 'guy in suit' aesthetic that Japan have stuck with even as recently as Shin Godzilla. He has weight, presence and the horrific aspect a lot of Godzilla movies don't tend to give much focus. He has a few unique abilities specific to this version of Godzilla, but nothing particularly stand out. The premise isn't particularly bad either. The general premise of the first part (as to avoid any spoilers) is that the inhabitants of Earth were forced to flee into space after monsters started to rise and destroy the planet, the most fearsome of the monsters being Godzilla. Years later, they try to destroy Godzilla and take the planet back. It's set in the future so there's some sci-fi technology in there which does help set this take on the King of Monsters apart from others which are largely based on existing technology of the era (exceptions to things like the oxygen destroyer). Now after that brief praise, some negatives. The anime foundation really shows its ugly face here bringing nigh every trope I'm long past being able to stomach. Why they chose this 3D anime style is beyond me. 3D animation in anime rarely looks good and is something studio's are still clearly a long way away from mastering. As with most examples, it's probably to cut costs and nothing more, not used to actually do something 2D animation would be unresonable to do. There's nothing on screen where 2D animation wouldn't look just as good or even better, nowhere that 3D animation is used to actually improve the visual experience. It all feels very cheap and amature with the choice of animation style there to lower costs rather than improve the product. When video games such as Guilty Gear, Dragonball Fighterz or Fire Emblem are emulating a 2D style of Japanese animation better than actual TV series or Movies, probably just don't bother with it. Like most parts of a production, 3D animation is used properly when you don't even realise or forget that it's even there. The characters themselves are very bland, the typical cast of stereotypes you'll find in the vast amount of forgettable anime with little to nothing that makes them stand out in terms of both visual characteristics and personality. ""I just want to become more powerful so I'm not useless!"", *gasp* ""I-it can't be!"", ""I'll hold them back, just go!"" and running towards things to attack whilst screaming, pretty much every trope is here with zero self awareness. Godzilla is ultimately about the human characters with the monsters typically having very little actual screen time. This cast of characters are difficult to sit with and Godzilla really doesn't suit the overly dramatic ""this isn't how people actually behave"" style that the anime genre often delivers. Alongside that, we have the futuristic technology and concepts this sci-fi rendition brings. This itself isn't a problem, on the surface it is all visually and conceptually appealing and as stated, something unique for this rendition of Godzilla...But again, anime tropes. We have characters over explaining even the most basic of ideas treating the audience as total morons. It's too much. A lot of this the audience could work out for themselves, ""show, don't tell"" as the saying goes, though the writers for this obviously don't know when to shut up. The soundtrack hits a fine balance between forgettable and awful. Typically anything with a guitar in it sounds utterly terrible but other than that, the OST as a whole is just bad enough to be noticable but nothing I didn't forget about literally a scene later. Instrument choices are questionable at best, pieces are often tone deaf, its not rare to have a track totally out of place for what's actually going on in the scene...Oh, and the tracks in the credits are the typical female fronted pop song you'll find in the vast majority of anime, again, a trope that just has no place in a franchise like Godzilla. It's a shame that I had such a bad time with this. It's the end of Christmas/New Year, I had one day to myself between my other half going back to work and myself starting back, new Netflix subscription, I looked forward to sitting down and binging this series for some tasty Godzilla goodness I've not had the chance to experience yet...And it feels like I shouldn't have bothered. Would have legitimately prefered to sit through Godzilla '98.",Godzilla,Godzilla: Monster Planet - Movie Reviews

7604,Jonathon M,"Jul 18, 2019","Beginning my first concentrated foray into the anime genre, I thought it would be best to start with a cultural icon I was familiar with: Godzilla. This thinking has since been proven misguided. Godzilla: Monster Planet is an accomplishment in cinema; it is impressive that a movie featuring the King of the Monsters can be so boring. A non-speaking giant lizard is remarkably the least one-dimensional character in the production. I never knew how little I cared about the ""science"" explaining why Godzilla is so formidable an opponent, but luckily I had this force fed to me for conservatively half the movie. The one redeeming quality is Godzilla does seem to be truly a creation of God like longevity and proportions in this take. Will likely not invest time in sequels, as even an hour after watching it I still cannot remember a single character's name other than ""we get it, your macho"" alien, ""constantly seeking revenge and relevance"" protagonist, and ""what are you doing, fighting?"" young girl.",Godzilla,Godzilla: Monster Planet - Movie Reviews

Godzilla is suppose to be the main antagonist of the series, but as you dig deeper and depper you soon realize that he is a misunderstood being that we cannot understand with our current knowledge. Godzilla on the surface level is just the ""King of Monster"", but he represent a higher being that is meant to be the savior of main kind. You don't truly understand Godzilla mindset in this movie, but I hope they make a mini series to show the life and struggle of Godzilla. I do not see how this movie could further to be shown without it winning a noble piece prize. I had to go back to this movie multiple time and analyze each individual frame to discover the true master piece of a film this really is.

What Are The Elements Of A Good Story? Now for the ripping. Here are some to consider that will hopefully summarize this film. Plot - ""Kill the monster"". Almost as good as Dwayne Johnson in Skyscraper; a story about a building. I'm sure some movie executive spent many brain cells coming up with a movie about a building. Maybe, 1 brain cell. So in this case, 2 brain cells. Characters - There are a lot of them and I never really cared for any of them. Good or bad. Setting - The animation is gorgeous! Style Tone - The animation is gorgeous! Overall, I gave this movie 3 stars just because of the animation? or should i say ART is absolutely gorgeous. The minute details, shimmering of light, expressions, shadows and glows. It is kind of like looking at a gorgeous model. You cannot take you eyes off of. Yes, that is called staring. I am sure she/he has a great mind, personality, giving, talented. But who cares its shiny. There it is... This movie is ""Shiny"".... Watch and you will see what I mean and most likely will say, ""yes, its good"". In my case, three stars because the ART really blows my mind.

To be fair, the world it builds is interesting as hell, I give the movie a lot of credit for its world building. The idea that our earth has basically been taken over by Godzilla, and when we return to it the environment has adapted to him as the dominant species is a damn intriguing idea that I have certainly never seen taken on before. I also like seeing Godzilla put in the spot of the straight up villain after years of skewing him into the sort of anti-hero role. Also with the futuristic place of the movie, all the sci-fi gadgetry and alien culture we have now is interesting to see played around with. All of this stuff in the movie, I was really enjoying. My problem with movie however is a big one...literally. It's Godzilla. He's just not in much of the movie, and when he does show up, he barely even moves. There's just no excuse for this. The guy in the restrictive rubber suit moved more, so now we have an anime where his potential for movement is endless, and he basically stays in one spot? There is simply no excuse for this, and it kind of pissed me off. It's Godzilla in anime form, this is your opportunity to really have fun with this character. But instead he just stands in some trees and moves his head around a little. And yes, without getting too much into spoilers, let's just say he doesn't really do that much even. Some of the action scenes with the other creatures of this planet of monsters are cool, and I did like the exploration of this world, but when you call your movie Godzilla you give your movie a certain responsibility. I loved the movies world building, I even enjoyed some of the characters, and the animation is pretty good and there are a couple quotable lines throughout. The world building is really what gives this movie the ranking it does, I was actually pretty engaged in this universe because of that. But the problem is, it can't help but feel like the first chapter that it is. All I can say is, chapter two better be god damn amazing.",Godzilla,Godzilla: Monster Planet - Movie Reviews

7630,Brandon S,"Jan 27, 2018","Since it was recently released on Netflix as Godzilla, Part I: Planet of the Monsters, I'd been more than curious about the first full-length anime feature film to feature the king of monsters. In addition to tall, dark and gruesome, the film also features a number of other cameos, if you know how to recognize them: Dogora, Kamacuras, and Dahagra, to name a few... (yes, I saw Mecha too, but that's just a bit too obvious). Anyway, you'd think that for any Godzilla fan, the whole thing sounds like a dream come true. Unfortunately, the stiff, emotionless, low quality, chuggy animation (I'd swear I can see at least half the movie frame by individual frame); tedious, mind-numbing, sickeningly repetitive dialogue; sloppy, non-sensicle story; and conspicuous absence of ambience and music for a vast majority of the film make me wonder what kind of cheap attempt at a cash-in prompted this little excursion into Dullsville. The only thing that kept me watching was the simple fact that the boring, uninspired story promised that little bit of action which, finally accompanied by some ear-catching background music, tried to help this helplessly floundering fish back into the water. On the other hand, since among the gallery of expressionless faces the likes of which we haven't seen since Advent Children, only Haruo's seems to display any sort of emotion, and even then, I can't tell if he's angry or just struggling to drop a load in his trousers over the constant flip-flop of opinion and strategy the movie seems to play around with, there's honestly nothing which can elevate this movie above the rank of--and this is surely fitting--pure cannon fodder.

Music is generic. Plot wise it's riddled with BIG plot holes that made the characters' plan nonsensical.

It's a shame that it couldn't have been in a more interesting movie. The movie is being distributed in America and several other countries via Netflix. It may initially look like a series, because it will ask to play ""Part 1, Episode 1"", but it is just one ninety minute movie that was released theatrically in Japan. It is expected to become a trilogy, which may be the reason it is shown like this, with Parts 2 and 3 to be added afterward. This movie has a different feel from previous Godzilla movies. It starts after the monsters have rampaged the cities. Humanity has fled the Earth with help from an alien species, after giant monsters have taken over the world. Now, they have returned to kill the worst monster there was, Godzilla. The movie feels more like a space anime, even when Godzilla shows up near the end. The animated format suits the monster, keeping him from looking as fake as he does in certain live-action outings. The scenes also show him in an effectively menacing light. He is a very powerful force, and the animation style emphasizes that. But the rest of the movie is not as good. Before the final Godzilla fight scene, there is over an hour of things that are not as interesting. The concept is kind of intriguing, but the characters feel flat. This is not helped by the fact that there is very little action, and a lot of space jargon. That is not to say that it was completely boring. It still has some great science fiction visuals, and a unique take on the Godzilla story. It just doesn't have the pull that it should. But the climax is really good, and the ending, while it is obvious sequel bait, did make me interested in seeing what happens next. Hopefully, the sequels would have more interesting characters. jaythemovieguy.blogspot.com",Godzilla,Godzilla: Monster Planet - Movie Reviews

7655,Italian G,"Mar 14, 2021","This review contains spoilers. How to Train Your Dragon 3 was a huge disappointment. I will be unpopular, but let me explain in detail why I didn't like it. The first 2 films are absolute masterpieces. The characters, the story, the animations ... Everything was just perfect. For the third, therefore, I had enormous expectations. Then, at the end of the film, I was pretty angry about how they developed this story arc. I mean, in short, the ending is wonderful, for sure. it is also very moving. But the beauty ends here. Everything else is just one stretch after another to get to the good ending. it's as if they already knew how the trilogy was going to end, but didn't have the slightest idea how to get there consistently. The villain, Grimmel, is one-dimensional and left me nothing. The animations, of course, are spectacular and are very colorful. But this is not just a movie. It's not just a nice ending. I know I shouldn't make comparisons, but for example Toy Story 3 (which after there is 4 is another matter) not only has a beautiful ending that will have moved everyone, even non-fans, but also a good villain, a articulated and well-structured story, a great evolution of the characters but above all great emotions. Here all this is only in the beautiful ending, but not in the rest of the film, too flat and made to stretch the broth. How to train your dragon 3 had great potential, but unfortunately it did not succeed in its intent.",How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World - Movie Reviews

7657,Anna M,"Mar 06, 2021","its good but very sexist undertones, whether its the light fury not being regarded as the queen of all dragons (despite the same abilities as a night fury) to the end showing Hiccup and his son on a boat, showing him the world and then handing him off to his wife. Also theres a daughter who doesnt even so much as get her hand held at the end- it is mainly regarding his son. I feel like this movie could have been improved by not making the 4 main females either a side kick (ruffnut, light fury of toothless, astrid) or as merely the mother with no significant role. The mother was the best representation of women empowerment, showing just that women can do shit too lmfao. Also, this is a world of vikings yes. But it is also fictional with dragons. Women were considered empowered in the land of vikings- they were tough. They're tough too yes but only in their relation to how they can serve a man. Just kind of made the movie leave me with a bad taste in my mouth. But, women were considered property until the 1920's and not permitted to open bank accounts until the 1970s so I guess i'm asking too much. Decent plot overall, not a lot of character development. Toothless was the most 3d character with many layers because they had femininely represented him in the earlier movies and now had to make him the guy in his relationship with the light fury (who isnt even given a nickname)- they couldve done a lot more considering they're dragons and their only point of reference is how to write for humans ig. Good show either way but kind of disappointed me. At least hold your daughters hand at the end and show her the world like you're showing your son. Did you just have her to replace Astrid? Idk, just kind of backwards when you consider the main demographic is incredibly impressionable young boys and girls haha. 3 1/2 stars pretty good",How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World - Movie Reviews

7662,blake n,"Feb 11, 2021","The 2019 film: How to Train your Dragon Hidden World was astonishingly heartwarming and felt like a true masterpiece, However The general story line felt similar to the previous movie: How to train your dragon 2 that was released in June of 2014. The Film is about the Viking leader, Hiccup and his rare Night Fury dragon, Toothless on a Quest to find another Night Fury dragon, and to explore the world to discover new dragons. They discover another Dragon like Toothless however in their search they attract the attention of the powerful and fearsome enemy Grimmel the Grisly. A ruthless dragon hunter who wants to wipe out all dragons. Hiccup and toothless must find the hidden world of Caldera to hide their dragons and keep them safe from Grimmel's wrath. The relationships between the characters in the movie were strong and full of emotion. And the acting was fantastic, you could really feel the bond between all the characters. The movie had plenty of funny and dramatic moments over the course of the story. I personally enjoy the animations and the atmospheric environments in the film. And the music in the film was very well composed and added to the mood of film perfectly Many Scenes in the movie brought me Joy or sadness. It was full of great moments that made me laugh or smile, as well as some parts that brought a tear to the eye. Although the plot felt kind of similar to the previous movie with them dealing with an enemy who wanted to destroy/control all dragons it was still unique. The ending was both sad and happy which can be a difficult effect to produce in films. I highly recommend you watch How to Train you Dragon Hidden World because it was a wonderful experience, and I could watch It repeatedly. It is well worth your time and money.

Perfect cast and the family differences are everything you worry about when your parents are introduced for the first time. Some of the scenes are brutal and make you feel embarrassed to the point of discomfort, which exactly what you'd expect when your parents are trying to put you on blast in front of your fiance.

I think jokes where the punchline is ""that was awkward!"" are annoying and that is the bulk of the comedy in this movie, but I made it through by reminding myself that De Niro produced the movie, so he must've thought the jokes were funny even though they were at his character's expense most of the time. The type of situation the movie is about where Ben has to rely on others to be as reserved and courteous as he's been toward his wife's family and them failing to do so makes me shudder as I can see it happening to me.

7699,"Oct 16, 2019","I began my acquaintance with this trilogy precisely from the second part. I watched it once in my childhood, not even knowing that it was a continuation, because the title doesn't have the usual numbering. Therefore, for me, this film is completely independent and separate, although in conjunction with the first part it looks organically. This is a great example of a sequel: in it, the story continues, not repeats. After watching Meet the Parents, the logical question remains: what about the Fockers? So getting to know them is a natural continuation, revealing the story on the other hand and deepening the main character, the case when the second part cannot be missing. Without it, the first film is inferior. The disadvantage is, perhaps, a significant difference in the time intervals between films in life and in the plot. It is noticeable that several years have passed from the first part, while in history the action takes place hardly in a year. In a good way, both parts should be one film divided into two. But otherwise the comedy is excellent, sometimes surpassing the first in humor. But it is for my taste. I understand people for whom some jokes here may be over the edge. However, for lovers of this style it's just sweetie. And the actors are still the best that is in these films. Nowhere else can you see in one frame such Hollywood legends as Robert De Niro and Dustin Hoffman.

7752,Anmol R,"Aug 18, 2011",Horror? Are you kidding me. There's no such element of horror. The first few minutes were good and the opening especially but soon I found the plot swinging around some bad direction. Misha is not well in her act but yeah for fans there is a topless shot. It can be suggested that the plot got strangled with a low budget and poor direction. I came to know later that it is derived of a book so it makes things pretty clear. Its common that directors are not able to present a book properly in short running time of a feature film. The same could have happened to it as well. There are many loose ends in the movie. Its average as a thriller but not appropriate for horror genre. No big surprises as well after you know the name of the movie.

It is arguably the most ambitious film in the series and a lot emotions thrown into the mix. And the humor is great. Although only the animation of pandas isn't that much finished but if you have only this flaw in the movie then you are successful in entertaining an audience. Also, the climax is one of the best.

7760,DJ K,"Aug 28, 2021","My issues with this movie comes down to one key issue: its relation to the first two movies in the trilogy. This shows through in a number of ways: largely the story and the drastic change in tone. The story of the first two movies has Po out of his depth, coming to terms with a facet of himself through great effort and struggle. In the first, he must come to terms with the responsibility he always dreamed of having, and the consequences should he fail to live up to that responsibility. He goes through a crucible, realizing that every single one of his heroes despises him, and what he represents, then realizing he is expected to defend the valley from the greatest threat it has ever faced. In the second movie, Po must face the man who killed his parents and led a genocide of his people, orphaning him and making him the last of his species. Lord Shen is certain that he killed every single panda. Po must come to terms with his past, and in doing so saves all of China from a despot. The third movie starts by completely subverting the plot of the second. The pandas survived! The reason the second movie exists, and Po's struggle therein, is now far less meaningful. And Po's struggle in the third movie is less interesting and less meaningful than those previous. He's told he's now a teacher, and worries that he isn't able to do his job well. The stakes are far lower, and the emotional impact is similarly reduced. If he can't teach well, then his friends training will suffer until he figures it out. Then, upon arriving in the Panda village, Po just... figures out how to teach. He didn't go through anything in an attempt to figure out how to teach, he just magically got better. The other side of the story, in which Po finds his family while dealing with Kai, is similarly bland. His father, who we've never met and have no reason to care about beyond a single line in the second movie and the expectation that 'if he's Po's father, then we have to care about him', is introduced and immediately we're struck with the expectation that the character deserves the audience's attention and emotional connection. The writers didn't let Ping feel replaced, they didn't let Po wonder why he'd lived without his people for his entire life, and they expected an emotional connection to exist in a vacuum. As far as antagonists go, Tai Lung was amazing and Lord Shen impeccable. Kai threatens far less than his predecessors: Tai Lung threatened the entire Valley, and beyond. Shen threatened all of China. Kai threatened a few dozen characters, less than 10 of which we actually know. Kai doesn't connect to Po's inner struggle at all in the same way that Tai Lung and Shen did. And Kai's attitude throughout is far less distinctive than his predecessors. The humor and campiness of this third installment were also grating, especially after the wonderful physical humor and genuinely intense mood that the first two movies attained at critical points. Meanwhile, the final fights here are interspersed with random panda villagers doing one move, then celebrating, or Po just grandstanding, instead of genuinely reaching out to his enemies as he did in the first two movies. That said, these are far more apparent than the issues above, which took me a while to put to words. I'm far happier just watching the first two movies and considering that the end of the series.",Kung Fu Panda 3,Kung Fu Panda 3 - Movie Reviews

7781,Charlie A,"Nov 08, 2020","I had to think really hard about my thoughts for this movie. I hold the Kung Fu Panda franchise very close to my heart. I have invested a lot of my time in not just the movies, but as well as the side series. Overall, I think this is a great movie, it just left me feeling very underwhelmed. It still has all of the great elements from the first two films. The animation, the action, and the deep themes are all present in the third installment of this franchise. The new style of Kung Fu that is introduced, chi, was a pretty good addition. Also, I liked how they were able to reintroduce Oogway into the storyline. And of course...you have Po, who is still the lovable and funny lead protagonist we all love. All of these aspects are the reason why I love this franchise so much. However, I still feel that there was a lot of missed potential here and somethings that simply weren't going to work for me. Kai as the villain was fine for me, but he felt much more generic compared to the villains from the previous films. I didn't like how Shifu and the Furious Five were off in the distance for this film (though their minimal amount of screen time is pretty awesome). But my biggest issue with the film is the other pandas (more specifically Li (Po's father) and Mei Mei). The other pandas make the film feel a lot more childish, and I didn't find any of their interactions with Po to be that funny. This was something I expected though, so I wasn't as bothered at that. After, the primary audience for most of the DreamWorks films is younger children. But there were two new characters that I believe were the epitome of wasted potential. First of all their is Po's biological father Li. Considering how the two of them reuniting was the main plot of the story, it seemed like a great continuation of the storyline. But most of their interactions with each other are meant to be for jokes, and when the creators tried to make some emotional moments with them, it felt sort of disingenuine. And then you've got Mei Mei. This flirtatious Panda was the most disappointing part of this film for me because I had such high hopes for her. Giving Po a girlfriend would have been a genius move on their part as it could really help shape his arc as the Dragon Warrior. Her one good interaction with Po is their first one, where she's flirting with Po, but making it seem like he flirting with her. And that's it. That is literally all that she does. She learns how to use nunchucks...and...um...she...uh...yeah that's about it. It might seem like I am being hard on this movie and I am. But it is simply because I know the potential that these movies have. That with another sequel in the works, DreamWorks could give us a franchise that could surpass How to Train Your Dragon. They didn't utilize certain plot points that would have made this movie so much better. If this were the last movie, I definitely would have disliked it much more, but maybe they can make amends in future installments. As nitpicky as I am, I think that this still a great family film that I recommend. Just make sure you watch the first two movies first.",Kung Fu Panda 3,Kung Fu Panda 3 - Movie Reviews

7806,Adhyan d,"Oct 22, 2021",Terminator 2 is one of the sequels that in a lot of ways surpass the original. The action is significantly larger and better. CGI is improved by a landslide. The movie isn't populated with humor but some witty dialogues are added as a nice addition. The emotions of this movie are prime especially the ending which I wouldn't spoil for you but it hits vey hard and is very very effective. Of course the performance by Arnold is fantastic. And the villain is not trying to overpower his image from the 1st movie. So its absolutely an entertaining and thrilling experience.

7809,"Sep 04, 2021","Come with me if you want to know how one of the greatest action movies of all time holds up thirty years later. For a movie of its length, it's very engaging, but a few points do kind of feel sluggish here and there. I also took issue with not remembering if the T-1000's cop uniform was part of the shapeshifting, or if he stole it off the cop who found him. Those issues aside, they're small enough, but they kind of bothered me. Nitpicks aside, the plot made sense if you ignore the time paradoxes, and the characters were amazing. John Connor, despite being only ten years old, is a great lead character, and Edward Furlong's acting is brilliant, by both child acting standards, and acting standards in general. Linda Hamilton also demonstrates an amazing transformation from the first movie, and Arnold Schwarzenegger goes from stoic killing machine to a self-aware machine that learns what it means to be human. The visual effects hold up great, with one or two nitpicks I won't emphasize. It all enhances the story where it's used, only adding to the T-1000's threat. The pulse pounding soundtrack, and great dynamic between John and the T-800 add to the spectacular action set pieces, all of which are the primary elements that hold it up to this day, as well as its theme of the future being yours to write.",SHOW MORE,Terminator 2: Judgment Day,Terminator 2: Judgment Day - Movie Reviews

It's one of the best sequels and action movies ever. The visual effects still hold up and I'm still astonished that they managed to create these mindblowing effects in 1991 and this makes for some truly creative stuff with the T-1000, an excellent villain that makes you dread for the main characters. I genuinely did not know how the main characters would survive. The action is exciting and suspenseful with that motorcycle chase being the standout and that twist with Arnold's character being our Kyle Reese in this movie is brilliant! Speaking of brilliant, this movie somehow got me emotionally invested into a cyborg whether it was T-800's beautiful relationship with John as well as his sacrifice in the end, showing that while he's a cyborg, he has a ton of emotion in his heart. Sarah becomes a badass in this movie and I love the mother-son bond with John. Just about every character in this movie is so well-written and memorable including Dyton. and the story is tense, exciting and has massive stakes.

Even though I'm sure everyone has seen it, it's a good chance to reassure yourselves that the Terminator films were once groundbreaking cinema, as well as being great films. Although Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines (2003) is nowhere near as bad as people seem to remember it being, that is when the series should have shut down. Terminator: Genisys (2015) is bizarrely named, and it's bizarre that it exists, but at least there was an idea somewhere there, lost amongst the rubble. Terminator: Dark Fate (2019) I can't explain at all. I went in thinking this is the moment I might see another half decent Terminator, but sadly not. Terminator 2 however, is the high bar that every sci-fi film should aim for. The effects still look astounding today, you believe in all the characters, and the switch of Schwarzenegger's Terminator from bad to good for the second film is the stroke of genius that makes it work.

7842,Pedro G,4d ago,"Buena película, injustamente criticada, creo que es un clásico navideño que hay que ver obligatoriamente. Si hay que decir que tiene una gran cantidad de errores que me di cuenta reviendo esta película. Dejando de lado la gran dirección de arte/vestuario y el maquillaje elaborado, estoy de acuerdo con muchos defectos de la película dichos por la critica. Para empezar esta es una película basada en un cortometraje animado, y se la convirtió en un largometraje de poco mas de una hora y media, estirando la historia con un ritmo lento, con una fotografía algo aburrida y con unos efectos especiales no tan buenos. Por otro lado, la película es sumamente mejorada por la brillante actuación de Jim Carrey como el propio Grinch. Creo que con el gran manejo corporal y los diálogos improvisados de Carrey lo vuelven un personaje icónico y que funciona para mí. Se mantiene fiel al carácter travieso del cortometraje original mientras lo lleva a otro nivel. También, creo que Taylor Momsen fue elegida perfectamente para interpretar a Cindy Lou-Who y su ternura es prácticamente icónica y perfecta. El resto del elenco hace un buen trabajo con el material que se les da y el compositor James Horner realiza un gran trabajo. Por ultimo, el mensaje familiar de la película sobre el espíritu navideño puede no ser tan simple y puro como en el cortometraje clásico, pero sigue siendo muy claro. En conclusión, un clásico navideño muy icónico, con algunos fallos, pero que es una vista obligada durante la navidad.",The Grinch,How the Grinch Stole Christmas - Movie Reviews

7845,Eric P,"Nov 07, 2021","How the Grinch Stole Christmas is a pretty bad movie. Jim Carrey as the Grinch would be considered pretty scary for some kids while I think Carrey is overacting. Speaking of scary, why do Rick Baker and Gail Rowell-Ryan think it's a good idea to give the characters of Whoville pretty horrifying make-up? Think the reviews on the make-up design is pretty overrated. Also, why do Brian Grazer and Ron Howard think it's a good idea to make a Dr. Seuss movie (family friendly) that contains dark themes and somewhat scary moments when their more audience is for children? To this day, I'll never understand what they're thinking. Overall, this movie is pretty bad. I've seen worse movies but I know for sure this is one of the worst Christmas movies I have ever seen.

It relies on pop culture references, unfunny humor (for the most part), Jim Carrey's over-the-top performance, scenes that are too inappropriate for children (such as the moment where the Grinch landed on Martha's breasts, fuck that scene!), kiss-your-ass jokes, and the creepy design of the Whos.

7855,Christopher D,"Jan 17, 2021","This is the version of the Grinch that I've grown up and it continues to give me the nostalgic kick I want during the holidays! This was a divisive adaptation during its release apparently while the criticisms remain fairly valid, the overall view on director Ron Howard's movie has softened over the years and become a surprise fan-favorite. Looking at this movie from a technical standpoint, it is largely unexceptional. Apart from the nicely whimsical art direction/costumes and elaborate makeup, I am willing to agree about the movie's many flaws; there is the padded narrative to turn a cartoon short into a feature-length film, the sluggish pacing, the somewhat dull cinematography not lending itself well to the wonderous cheery aroura that they hoped to capture, some iffy CGI/bluescreen and the rather wonky tones at play. Despite all that, I still find it to be consistently entertaining today as I did in the theater in 2000. The movie is substantially lifted by Jim Carrey's brilliantly hilarious and inspired turn as The Grinch himself. Much of the criticism towards the movie was mainly aimed at how Ron Howard let Carrey go so wild for the role with no restraint, leading to numerous scenes that go arguably a bit too long. But I believe with Carrey's impeccable physicality and improvisational quips, it just flat-out iconic and works for me. He remains true to the mischievous character of the original short while taking it delightfully over the top to another level; not to mention nearly all his lines are so damn quotable. There are other redeeming qualities along the way. Taylor Momsen was perfectly cast as Cindy Lou-Who and her natural cuteness is practically iconic, though its a tad shame her acting career didn't go to far after this. It is actually quite poignant how her character was more mature and had more sense than any of the adults in Whoville! Bill Irwin, who's like a low-key physical comedian himself, is very good as Cindy's father; bringing this warmth and bubbling demeanor to the proceedings as he is the first adult character to understand Cindy's thoughts about the true meaning of Christmas. The rest of the cast does a good job with the material they are given, composer James Horner puts out a lovely music score and I always enjoy the Faith Hill song in the end credits. The movie's familiar message about the Christmas Spirt might not be as simply put and pure as it was in the classic short but remains very clear and essential regardless. - 6.5/10 (B-)",The Grinch,How the Grinch Stole Christmas - Movie Reviews

Ideologically, Howard's big budget eyesore is perfectly postmodern, another crass commodification not just of the holiday, but a commercialization of commonplace (and meaningless) gripes about the commercialization of Christmas itself, bemoaning the loss of some original real meaning behind Christmas and yet devoid of any spirituality or religious feeling whatsoever.

The Grinch was bullied and harassed SO MUCH to the point that he moved to the top of a MOUNTAIN just to escape. Not only that, but for 53 years, every Christmas, they make SO MUCH noise that the Grinch can STILL hear them from the top of a MOUNTAIN. With that said, the Grinch had a point. Jokes aside, the Grinch terrified me as a kid. Especially when he jumps from the ceiling like a furry green Spider-Man and scares Cindy Lou. ""You're the, the, the… THE GRINCH!"" This will forever be a Christmas favourite of mine since it's full of nostalgia. But if I take my nostalgia goggles off, this still holds up as a fun, ridiculous, live-action adaptation. This time around, I was able to appreciate just how much work went into the costumes, makeup, practical effects, and the set design. It felt like the animated short come to life (weird noses and all). Jim Carey is a f*cking legend. (Well, duh.) He brings SO much energy, charisma, humour, and heart to the grouchy Grinch. I don't even know how I was ever scared of him as a kid. (Probably because I was a little wimp.) Also, Cindy Lou is still adorable and her ""Where Are You Christmas"" song is still a banger. I'm indifferent on how this movie stretches the 26-minute animated classic into being 4x longer. They actually add some fun bits like the Grinch's origin, but it also feels like pointless filler even if was still fun. I also can't forgive this movie for being so stupid sometimes. For example, Cindy Lou catches the Grinch stealing her tree (and everything else in her house) but is too tired to recognize the ONLY green person in Whoville. It's a family movie after all, so I'll try not to think too hard. Ultimately, I still love this movie even if it isn't perfect.

Jim Carrey is at his all time best, acting as the Dr. Suess's Grinch. This movie should be rated at least at a 85%. If you are going to watch this movie by yourself with a serious point of view, then the film may come across you differently than those who watch with their family (as a family movie should be). All kids i know absolutely love this film. The acting is wonderfully done. The actors really did their part on making sure the whole family would enjoy the film. Jim Carrey had to do some serious training just to endure the suit he wore for the Grinch, which he needs some serious praise for. This man really deserves an award for his proformance. The story is very close to original that we all love, but with a bit of our modern day civilization thrown in it. With great story telling by the narrator Anthony Hopkins, this emotionally capturing film will make families hearts grow three times bigger and laugh three times harder than they usually would (like the ugly laughs you always try to hold back on). The characters are quite unique and well thought out. Each one making their own type of impact on you, which what a great is exactly supposed to do!

I liked how they really touched upon anger, bullying, sympathy, humiliation, the urge of getting revenge, realization, and forgiveness. I liked how they gave The Grinch a realistic backstory to why he hates Christmas and the town of Whoville so much. I also loved the characteristics that they gave Cindy Lou Who. She was a really likable and smart character and I really sympathized with her when get would receive ridicule from the mayor for wanting everyone even The Grinch to be together for Christmas. I also loved Martha (Mr. Grinches love interest). She is hot, and she is really funny at times. I also loved Cindy Lou Who's parents because of their wacky, and clumsy antics. I absolutely loved the ending! This movie is a fun, entertaining, hilarious movie that has a good message and a good storyline and it is loyal to the book and the 1966 animation. I recommend it!",The Grinch,How the Grinch Stole Christmas - Movie Reviews
7877,Dan E,"Dec 25, 2020","What so many critics get wrong with this movie is the value of Howard's strivings with visual style of the film.

Jim Carrey plays the Grinch really well and even today still makes me laugh. One thing I will say, I did not like the child Grinch scenes as much as I remember. The child actor did not do it for me, then again the acting overall in this movie is over the top and outlandish. Jim Carrey is easily the best part of this movie.

Mena massoud and Naomi Scott were perfect for the roles of Aladdin and jasmine will smith is great as the genie of course no one can top robin Williams but smith provided his own unique take on the character really the only downside is that Jafar wasn't as menacing or threatening as he should have been and was pretty badly miscast also its so unfortunate that they didn't get Gilbert Gotfried back to voice Iago if you like the original but want to see A slightly new take on this Arabian fairy tale then give it a watch,Aladdin,Aladdin - Movie Reviews

Will Smith not only did the Genie role justice but he knocked the performance out of the park. Naomi Scott and Mena Messoud played both of their characters very well. All of the musical numbers were done to perfection, as well as the new songs included in the film. The animation looked great, even making a big blue Genie look like he belongs in our world. The only major gripe I have with this movie is the actor who played Jafar was nowhere near as harsh and menacing as the character was in the original. All in all, even if you do not like live action remakes and are worried they will ruin your favorite film, you do not need to worry with this version of the film.

The opening feels rushed and they changed a lot about the movie to be P/C (the opening song being just 1 example). They also tried WAY too hard to be empowering to women... to the extent they got rid of anything that seemed over-objectifying and gave Jasmine a new song and other quirks that come off as offensive to people in the middle east who have gender roles as a cultural norm. It was a bit tragic given my wife lost interest in the first 25-35 minutes and things finally picked up a bit only to flop around a bit.

A few of the characters from the first film are shoehorned in too, especially Nigel (Jemaine Clement). Jesse Eisenberg (Blu) and Anne Hathaway (Jewel) reprise their roles, Eisenberg is the better of the two.

Also .....the species are--blu and Jewel are really critically extinct species in real life. The importance of the series is most inspiring... And people need to know when it's time to finally do something about hunting and bird trading. There's a time and place to have fantasy movies... but Rio tells us that the world can't always be your imagination and you have to care about other species. The spix's macaws are in the problems because our kind only care about the huge lump sum of money that spix's macaws are worth... when we should just leave them alone. You can literally buy a high end race car on the spix's macaws worth.. that is pretty sick and upsetting But the movie tells the story that it's time to pay attention That's what Rio is All about and will remain in my heart forever. If you could please make more it can do good for this world. For the purpose of the series Rio 1 and 2. I give it 5 Stars for being content that is the least reviewed, because most people just don't like bird's just because they are bird's... and only love them because of talking... Yes talking Bird... Very cool 😎 But honestly how would you feel about that amazing bird once you found out that it doesn't talk 🤔.... Or a crow poop's on you outside.... How do you feel about birds now? Rio 2 may have a very much lower performance score but I really love it and hopefully we can get Rio 3 2021 ((Absolutely fresh must see)) Also spix's macaws are to be reintroduce 2020 this coming year after Christmas from a newest Post from a wildlife conservation program.

7973,Jacob B,"Jul 23, 2019","Rio 2 has gorgeous animation that's a step up from the first film, great voice acting and catchy songs as well as decent comedy but that won't save it from its case of sequelitis thanks to the iffy messages that are essentially double standards, a villain that's reduced to a joke (thankfully, he's not the main antagonist again. IIRC, the villain and heroes don't even meet each other face-to-face until the third act) and a more formulaic story compared to the original's charm with more heavy handed eco-friendly messages than you can shake a stick at. Rio 2 is not that bad and it does have more effort put into it than Ice Age 5 but coming off the heels of the first film, Rio 2's a bit of a disappointment. I genuinely feel sorry for Blue Sky because they're so notorious for milking out Ice Age sequels that the other movies are overlooked even though they're actually relatively decent and underrated films. Oh well, maybe one day they'll get their own personal Into the Spider-Verse. ME FROM THE FUTURE: Well, now that Disney's shut down the company, I guess that next worthy competitor to Pixar won't be coming from this studio anytime soon. Yes, I consider The Peanuts Movie to be their best film but I still loved Inside Out more and it's hard to admire just how much of a turning point the first Ice Age film was for animation studios (that an animated film that was made by neither Pixar nor DreamWorks could be a success, especially since the other two CGI movies that came out in 2001 consisted of a flop and a Best Animated Feature nominee that offended animation fans for achieving that honour...but it offered some innovation by being the earliest CGI movie done with off-the-shelf software instead of dedicated so there's that) when it became Fox's own personal Shrek. So that last quote has aged about as well as The Birth of a Nation. Sad that now Blue Sky will never get a chance to earn legitimate acclaim the same way Sony Pictures Animation is garnering nowadays. I'll miss you guys :'(",Rio 2,Rio 2 - Movie Reviews

8001,Sevian B,"Mar 22, 2021","Troy was a beautifully choreographed, though inaccurate and messy movie at best- and a half-baked historical disaster at worst. I've never seen an adaption dilapidate its source as badly as this movie; each character and event was practically unrecognisable as based on the Iliad. And somehow the material things were lucky; the true appeal of the Iliad is its emotional depth, literary parallels, its focus on mortality, etc. We see none of that in the movie Troy. Replacing depth with romance, gore and battles doesn't work. (Two out of three of which are really the only salvageable part of this film, and I'm not talking about the romance: everyone seems to love the Achilles-Briseis arc, which, in the Iliad, was an abusive, nonconsensual bloodbath, and it is almost universally agreed upon that the man didn't give a damn about this girl. (Especially considering Achilles' sexual ambiguity) Which is nothing to celebrate in the slightest, and the writing isn't even that good; I wouldn't have really rooted for them if I hadn't know the real story anyways.) It feels like the writers purposely deviated from the source material just to annoy the viewer; not a single death, other than Hector's, was handled in a way that even slightly resembled the book. Not a single character arc either, and the list continues. The Iliad isn't a tale of forbidden romance, (not of Achilles and Briseis and definitely not of Helen and Paris; three out of four people mentioned are now considered to not want to pursue a romantic relationship with the other) or glory, and ESPECIALLY NOT THE FALL OF TROY. They were okay with Oddyseus though. Anyways, this movie ruined my week, and every time I think of it I cringe. Save yourself, and watch a better film. Honestly, I can feel Achilles rolling over in his and Patroclus' grave.",Troy,Troy - Movie Reviews

8004,Justin R,"Feb 04, 2021","There is much to like in this flawed historical epic. Troy is a visual triumph with stunning costumes and sets and plenty of giant, brutal CGI battles. The purists and Greek scholars may take issue with the historical liberties taken - but as an epic inspired movie there is much to like including a standout scene where Eric Bana's Hector fights Brad Pitt's Achilles. Troy is a good movie but not a great one. What's missing is depth - much of the characters reasoning, emotion and story is half baked and lacks depth. It's perplexing with such a talented ensemble cast and a 3 hour 16 minute runtime. However, Troy was released in the early 2000s following the likes of Gladiator and Lord of the Rings and obviously looked to cash in more on action rather than story and emotion which is where it falls short. Nonetheless its an entertaining, historical epic.",Troy,Troy - Movie Reviews

8009,Elena R,"Dec 19, 2020","Cinematically a good movie and Brad Pitt was excellent as Achilles. It's just unfortunate that a Hollywood blockbuster in 2004 couldn't handle telling the real story of Achilles and Patroclus. Instead of telling one of the most epic and tragic love stories of all time, they chose to make Patroclus a minor character--a friend and cousin. It was nearly incomprehensible why Achilles reacted as he did in that context. I had a lot of trouble finishing the movie because of that. Patroclus impersonated Achilles because he couldn't bear to see any more Greeks die when Achilles refused to fight. Achilles went berserk when Hector killed Patroclus and he knew, according to prophecy, Hector's death would mean his own as well. He told the Greeks that when he died, he wanted his ashes mixed with Patroclus' and buried together so they could be together forever in the afterlife. You don't do that for your bro' cousin. You do that for the man you love more than life itself. I wish the movie had had the courage to tell that story.",Troy,Troy - Movie Reviews
8010,Juggler J,"Nov 28, 2020","I feel this movie is under-rated by the professional critics, because they look at the technical and feel it's a sloppy movie. I love the way the story is told, and the action is very well done in my opinion. So many movies do fight scenes that bore me, and I believe it's because they don't feel real or natural. In the movie, everyone speaks of Achilles being a natural fighter blessed by the gods, but his own language and more importantly to me, his moves during the battles show of a well practiced fighter. He uses the same moves over and over, which are impressive the first time one sees them, but the fact he uses them again and again, and they don't always work for him, but he then moves onto another one, shows he's practiced and trained these moves. It shows he's got a library of moves to choose from, and he uses them over and over. And they surprise his opponents who haven't seen him use them before, and that's why the often work for him, but to him it's the same-old-same-old. The fighting Choreography is top-notch for that alone, in my opinion... but, it's well done in so many ways.",Troy,Troy - Movie Reviews
8011,Ryan S,"Nov 26, 2020","A long watch, but just about a worthwhile one. I enjoyed 'Troy', in short. A film, interestingly given his recent exploits, written by a certain David Benioff. It definitely has more than a few pacing issues, but they only affect the enjoyment factor minorly - at least to me. The score is a little lacklustre, mind. The casting is outstanding, even if I don't think all the performances are anything to truly shout about. I found Brad Pitt and Eric Bana, although entertaining, a bit wooden in parts. Elsewhere, Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean are arguably underused from an acting viewpoint - though their characters play huge parts, of course. You also have a load of other familiar faces, from Peter O'Toole to Brendan Gleeson to Rose Byrne to Diane Kruger. The definition of an ensemble. The action helps keep things moving, the battle sequences are very nicely done. The film takes an age to reach the event that everyone knows about, but when it finally does it's excellent. The cast and the action are my big takeaways from this. I couldn't comment on its accuracy on the original work. As a film, for me, it's very good.",Troy,Troy - Movie Reviews

Achilles is transformed into a generic modern action/war movie protagonist, the Greek gods, who were the most interesting part of the original poem, are completely absent, and interesting characters are transformed into one-dimensional caricatures. I may also add that the relationship between Achilles and Briseis is rather creepy due to the power differential.

The choreography of the single combat scenes is masterful and really this movie hits the top of my list solely because of the beach invasion scene. as implausible and dumb witted it may be, the film makers presented us a way it is theoretically possible with someone like achilles at the helm.

8024,Helena S,"Aug 11, 2020","I really liked this film even if it wasn't accurate. I like the idea of Patroclus being the cousin instead of a lover because it shows different kinds of love that people fight for. It also makes the lose more personal and hurtful since he was his family and guardian and he failed to protect him. I think the aspect in the beginning that Sparta and Troy just became allies and are enemies again makes the fight more important because both sides want to put an end to the fighting. The fighting is amazing, I like how at the end they do not shy away from showing the atrocities that the Greeks did to the Trojans. The visuals are very nice to watch. The only negative thing for me was that I wish they made it longer or made the whole event take longer, all the events seemed rushed. But besides that a great great movie.",Troy,Troy - Movie Reviews

E gente... o desenvolvimento do mesmo me dá vergonha alheia. Primeiro temos a forçação de barra quanto a ele. Todo mundo ""pagando pau"", o exaltando - até mesmo o próprio Rei, sendo que o personagem já cuspiu na cara dele em diversos momentos. Toda questão do seu proposito, no dialogo com sua mão, são contraditórios ao ponto de vista que ele tem ao ser questionado sobre a guerra. A sua relação com a Briseis é perigosa e abre mais uma vez a porta para síndrome de Estocolmo. O figurino do personagem não me agradou. É como se o Brad Pitt não pertencesse aquele universo, muito menos intimidasse seus inimigos. O fato de que o Rei não o matou não me desce de jeito nenhum. O seu ""amor"" pela briseis muito menos. Os combates são legais, assim como as batalhas em longa escala. O duelo entre Aquiles e Heitor foi muito bem coreografado. A OST cumpre seu proposito e a fotografia também - se atentando ao gênero.

8031,Matchell C,"Nov 14, 2021","'Toy Story 2' is one of the greatest 3D animated movies ever made, that is also a sequel. This movie is a huge step up to its original, in every single way. The plot of the movie has Woody hyped up about going to camp with his owner Andy. But unfortunately, Woody's arm gets ripped, leaving him to be shelved, and Andy had to leave Woody behind. Then during a rescue mission, involving Woody and a penguin, Woody gets kidnapped by the fat guy from 'Jurassic Park', in order for him to be sold to a museum, along with these new cow boy dolls that are also being shipped. A main conflict is then developed throughout the movie, that being, should Woody stay in a museum, were he can live forever, but never played with or loved again? or should he continue his life with Andy as a toy, despite the possibilities and risks that come with it? Both Woody and the viewer are given all valid points and reasons. It's a strong conflict, that works excellently with the main plot. The characters are true to the first film, yet they're different at the same time. What I mean by that, is that Woody, Buzz, Potato head, have carried over their personalities, but what they had learnt from the last movie, accurately reflects on how they would act now. Woody is really charming, and not a total meany. Though he had one selfish moment towards the end, that was crucial to his character. Buzz is now serious and wise, while not as funny now, he still has some nice little subtle jokes, leading to my next point. The jokes hear feel a lot more subtle and casually delivered, which is so much better. The animation is also a big step up, maybe even a little too good for 1999. My only complaint here is with Jessie, as she is mildly annoying first, then an even huger dodo bag then Woody. But she does have a back story that links back to the main argument of the film. From then on, she's a charming, quirky character, along with Bullseye and Stinky Pete (the other toys that were being shipped to the museum). 'Toy Story 2' is awesome, even looking at it as its own movie, not doing any comparisons. I will highly recommend this movie to everyone, for infinity, and beyond!",Toy Story 2,Toy Story 2 - Movie Reviews

8048,Jacob R,"Jun 21, 2021","I now present to you the first truly great Pixar movie. From what I said in the first two reviews, the biggest problem I had with both Toy Story and A Bugs Life is that the stories are a little too simple and there are no real emotional moments. This movie is where those moments finally come into play. I am of course talking about Jessie's backstory, which made a majority of kids cry, including me when I was younger. Speaking of Jessie, the new characters that are introduced in this movie are great, the highlight being of course Jessie and Bullseye. If I truly had to nic pic one problem, it's that the Prospector (Stinky Pete) feels like a really lousy excuse for a twist villain. It just felt like the people at Pixar and Disney (I think they bought Pixar at this point but I could be wrong) said ""so there's a villain in this story right?"" Basically, it felt last second. However, this doesn't hurt the quality of the film at all. I remember Stinky Pete as not being too annoying, which I can't say for future villains by this company (cough, Incredibles 2, cough). Anyway, I love this movie, and chances are, you do too. Is this possibly the best animated sequel ever? Go to Disney+ and see for yourself!",Toy Story 2,Toy Story 2 - Movie Reviews

The animation is an improvement from the first movie and the story is actually better than the first film. I just find this one a tad bit more engaging. This time Woody is apparently a rare collectors item. He had a Tv Show called Woody's Round Up Rodeo. And was a really hot toy at the time. He finds this out after trying to save an old penguin toy named Wheezy from a garage sale. When he saves him though he gets taken by a guy name Al. When he finds out about his show, two new characters Jessie, and Bullseye tell their story of why Woody should stay with them. But of course he wants to get back home to Andy so there's tension between all of the characters. Toy Story 2 is to me the best out of the four. As much as I enjoy the first one I just thought that this one had more character growth and a whole lot of depth.

8091,Italian G,"Mar 14, 2021","This review contains spoilers. How to Train Your Dragon 3 was a huge disappointment. I will be unpopular, but let me explain in detail why I didn't like it. The first 2 films are absolute masterpieces. The characters, the story, the animations ... Everything was just perfect. For the third, therefore, I had enormous expectations. Then, at the end of the film, I was pretty angry about how they developed this story arc. I mean, in short, the ending is wonderful, for sure. it is also very moving. But the beauty ends here. Everything else is just one stretch after another to get to the good ending. it's as if they already knew how the trilogy was going to end, but didn't have the slightest idea how to get there consistently. The villain, Grimmel, is one-dimensional and left me nothing. The animations, of course, are spectacular and are very colorful. But this is not just a movie. It's not just a nice ending. I know I shouldn't make comparisons, but for example Toy Story 3 (which after there is 4 is another matter) not only has a beautiful ending that will have moved everyone, even non-fans, but also a good villain, a articulated and well-structured story, a great evolution of the characters but above all great emotions. Here all this is only in the beautiful ending, but not in the rest of the film, too flat and made to stretch the broth. How to train your dragon 3 had great potential, but unfortunately it did not succeed in its intent.",How to Train Your Dragon,How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World - Movie Reviews

8093,Anna M,"Mar 06, 2021","its good but very sexist undertones, whether its the light fury not being regarded as the queen of all dragons (despite the same abilities as a night fury) to the end showing Hiccup and his son on a boat, showing him the world and then handing him off to his wife. Also theres a daughter who doesnt even so much as get her hand held at the end- it is mainly regarding his son. I feel like this movie could have been improved by not making the 4 main females either a side kick (ruffnut, light fury of toothless, astrid) or as merely the mother with no significant role. The mother was the best representation of women empowerment, showing just that women can do shit too lmfao. Also, this is a world of vikings yes. But it is also fictional with dragons. Women were considered empowered in the land of vikings- they were tough. They're tough too yes but only in their relation to how they can serve a man. Just kind of made the movie leave me with a bad taste in my mouth. But, women were considered property until the 1920's and not permitted to open bank accounts until the 1970s so I guess i'm asking too much. Decent plot overall, not a lot of character development. Toothless was the most 3d character with many layers because they had femininely represented him in the earlier movies and now had to make him the guy in his relationship with the light fury (who isnt even given a nickname)- they couldve done a lot more considering they're dragons and their only point of reference is how to write for humans ig. Good show either way but kind of disappointed me. At least hold your daughters hand at the end and show her the world like you're showing your son. Did you just have her to replace Astrid? Idk, just kind of backwards when you consider the main demographic is incredibly impressionable young boys and girls haha. 3 1/2 stars pretty good",How to Train Your Dragon,How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World - Movie Reviews

8098,blake n,"Feb 11, 2021","The 2019 film: How to Train your Dragon Hidden World was astonishingly heartwarming and felt like a true masterpiece, However The general story line felt similar to the previous movie: How to train your dragon 2 that was released in June of 2014. The Film is about the Viking leader, Hiccup and his rare Night Fury dragon, Toothless on a Quest to find another Night Fury dragon, and to explore the world to discover new dragons. They discover another Dragon like Toothless however in their search they attract the attention of the powerful and fearsome enemy Grimmel the Grisly. A ruthless dragon hunter who wants to wipe out all dragons. Hiccup and toothless must find the hidden world of Caldera to hide their dragons and keep them safe from Grimmel's wrath. The relationships between the characters in the movie were strong and full of emotion. And the acting was fantastic, you could really feel the bond between all the characters. The movie had plenty of funny and dramatic moments over the course of the story. I personally enjoy the animations and the atmospheric environments in the film. And the music in the film was very well composed and added to the mood of film perfectly Many Scenes in the movie brought me Joy or sadness. It was full of great moments that made me laugh or smile, as well as some parts that brought a tear to the eye. Although the plot felt kind of similar to the previous movie with them dealing with an enemy who wanted to destroy/control all dragons it was still unique. The ending was both sad and happy which can be a difficult effect to produce in films. I highly recommend you watch How to Train you Dragon Hidden World because it was a wonderful experience, and I could watch It repeatedly. It is well worth your time and money. Just be sure to watch the two previous Movies first so you do not spoil anything.",How to Train Your Dragon,How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World - Movie Reviews

However, they may not have been asking for the corniest possible melodramatic relationship story between it. And that makes this a rare contender for 'it's so bad, it's good.' The twisters are sheer entertainment, and usually come in at just the right point to break up the horribly acted melodrama, which would otherwise be unforgivable. Right from the get go, the jerk is trying to get a divorce and the sweetheart doesn't want it. And that dynamic lasts the entire film, until she eventually wins his heart back.

Throughout the movie, there is NO and I mean NO sexual chemistry between Bill and Jo, and it is clearly not reciprocated by Jo who is a hardworking, intelligent woman. Bill consistently destroys and derails Jo's research, telling her to leave her LIFES work behind in the storm, destroys Jo's car, and puts them in unnecessary danger. There's NO logical reason why Jo would want to be back with someone who disregards her safety, her boundaries, and lusts after her nonconsenually while having a girlfriend.",Twister,Twister - Movie Reviews

Yes, the movie cannot match the level of the original but it has it's good moments. The performances by actors and direction was good. The visuals were stunning and there were some surprises which shocked me. I had few problems with this movie. First, the story seemed too dark. The original was also dark story but it was presented in light manner and in other words, proper balance was there. Second, the last act seemed little bit stretched. Movie could have been 20-25 minutes short easily but overall it will not effect your experience. Overall, it was a good prequel for a 82 years old cult classic movie and I hope they make more adaptations using Oz books.",Oz the Great and Powerful,Oz the Great and Powerful - Movie Reviews

8154,Ethan T,"Aug 26, 2021","Oz the Great and Powerful. Such a strange film. A mix of dull narrative clichés and unpredictable magic. More than half of the film passes through well with the help of awe-inspiring CGI and a clear vision. As Oz, James Franco performed solidly without wowing. I found Mila Kunis's journey as Theodora perplexing and ultimately predictable. The central romance, similarly, is neglected but paraded around as important. Michelle Williams and Rachel Weisz round out the main cast with more solidity without stealing scenes for themselves. Some of the visuals seemed over-saturated and bombastic in the opening scenes in Oz, but this becomes balanced by a few breathtaking sequences later on. This might not be vintage Sam Raimi, but as a film Oz's positives just outweigh its scattered narrative and occasionally distracting CGI to deliver satisfying popcorn entertainment. In the end, the sense of wonder that the film clearly desires for you to feel lands.",Oz the Great and Powerful,Oz the Great and Powerful - Movie Reviews

8183,"Jun 18, 2018","It is only fitting that attempting a movie like this only be done when technology can take on the task. Visually, Oz is gorgeous, fit for the best Blu-Ray/HD home experience for years to come. For even the most casual of Wizard of Oz fans, the story of how the Great and Powerful Oz came to be the Wizard is very interesting and, especially by midway through the film, is exciting to watch. The story, though very slow-starting and buried by the horrendous acting from James Franco and miscast Mila Kunis, eventually becomes all about the larger Wizard of Oz story and, thus, entertains. The viewer has to wait, though. Clearly this version is for kids. The dialogue is ridiculously simple, choppy and hard to sit through, at times. Honestly, it may not have been as bad had James Franco not been playing the main character. His performance is painful. Mila, though more adorable than I've ever seen her, has too high of a voice to pull of the ""evil"" persona of Theodora, once a good witch, turned wicked by her sister as a result of Oz hurting her. She just didn't fit. Michelle Williams and Rachel Weisz, on the other hand were the best of good and evil. Rachel is perfect as a conniving witch. Michelle is pure and beautiful as Glenda the good with of the south. How the story begins in Kansas was very well done, especially as you watch the screen turn from old black and white, center-screen film to stunning colorful, widescreen high definition. It was gorgeous. Having his own companions ala Dorothy with Zach Braff as his monkey companion and China Doll brought back the charm of the original film. Eventually the story unfolds and merges perfectly into the Wizard we know. It was an enjoyable film, but Sam Raimi could have done better at directing through the poor script. He may have done his best with what he had, but in any case, the dialogue could have been written by me. The kids in the theater seemed to love it, though. And that may have been the point all along. If you enjoyed the Wizard of Oz, you have to give a theater version of Oz a chance.",SHOW MORE,Oz the Great and Powerful,Oz the Great and Powerful - Movie Reviews

Critics would be fair to say the acting, could have been better. Critics would be less fair to say the CGI was a failure do to it's overshadowing by Avatar from 2009. What they'd fail to tell you is that film's budget was so much more and was given much more vision by its director. So although it wasn't perfect, it was good for what it was. I personally believe if you're looking for a quick, thrilling adventure of the ancient Greeks, or just want to hear an awe inspiring Score written by the same composer as Game of Thrones(It was great but I prefer this as it's much better and much more unique!)

The 1981 original will always be my favorite ""sentimental"" version;hard to beat Stop-motion animation from Harryhausen. That being said....once I reconciled this in my brain I really started to enjoy this remake. This isn't nearly as bad as it's reputation. Quite the contrary. The film has a lot going for it. The picture quality is very good. 3D aspect is fair. Many of the landscape sections have plenty of that gimmicky depth that so many people seem to like. There are some strange distortions here and there, like scenes where there are crowds of people having a weird embossed look. I watched the film twice Fist in 3D than in 2D format . It's still good enough for me that it's a distinct improvement over the 2D for the 3D enthusiast like my self. I enjoy just about any Greek mythology flick about the gods. The story is very loosely based on the Greek myth of Perseus. Sam Worthington played a good brooding Perseus. How does't like Liam Neeson as Zeus, the man just delivers in every role he takes on . Mads Mikkelsen brought his usual charisma . Gemma Arterton as love interest for Perseus was a standout. The beauty of Andromeda has brought to life from the stunningly beautiful Alexa Davalos .

I always ignore these paid critics and go straight to the audience score, which was in this case a good rating.

This movie showed more of Maleficent's powers and the usage of her wings. Not to mention Angelina Jolie looked so badass in her final battle form and that heartbreaking moment when Maleficent took the hit from the arrow fired by Queen Ingrith to protect Princess Aurora( which was definitely one of the best and most touching scenes Disney had to offer). The different communities of Dark Fey that include the Tundra, Forest, Jungle and dessert Fey was very creative and that each type of Fey had their own beautiful wings).

This movie is a masterpiece of subtlety that rewatching brings fulfillment and joy to the heart. You are taken once again on tale of solitary moments cherished in time from proposal, trepidation, and Maleficent's undying love for Aurora. You feel her torment but realize with her the importance of understanding. One person's fear and prejudice forced two Kingdoms into a war neither one wanted. And you once again realize the sheer power Maleficent has at her command, even among her own kind, not just with respect to man. She is one not to be crossed and she made that clear. This movie is a wonderfully balanced journey of fear and bravery, pain and joy, and seeing peace rise from war. There is nothing Maleficent would not do for Aurora and that includes ...

8260,Ryan S,"Nov 12, 2020","More sluggish than entertaining, for me anyway. I enjoyed the first film, but 'Maleficent: Mistress of Evil' is one I never really got into. The whole premise surrounding Angelina Jolie's character is uninteresting, not helped by a lack of serious rationale for why characters, other than Maleficent, are acting the way they are; namely Michelle Pfeiffer's Queen Ingrith. At best, it's lame motivation. Jolie remains the star, while Elle Fanning is solid enough. Pfeiffer isn't as enjoyable as she should be, mainly due to the aforementioned, but still produces a good display. Chiwetel Ejiofor is a terrific addition to the cast, but I can't honestly say I'll remember his performance here - which is a shame. Warwick Davis is, slightly, underused too. Also, how strange to see former professional footballer John Carew on the cast; albeit in a minor role. The effects are, pleasingly, an upgrade at least; they all look great. I hold no ill feelings towards this, I just wish it was greater.",Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,Maleficent: Mistress of Evil - Movie Reviews

Review menu icon Profile image Kirstanuci Kirstanuci 11 months ago What do you get when you mash up Wicked Avatar Black Panther and Sleeping Beauty... ""Guess who's coming to dinner, literally?"" A film that Disney does right by the Disney Brand. There is enough emotional friction narrative from family, duty, community, society with a heavy emphasis on love and forgiveness and letting go via having the nature of a resurrecting phoenix. The Director Rønning with a super cgi production crew, cinematography, costumes, scenery no stone was left unturned in presenting breathtaking delicately embroidered beauty. Disney really delivers a visual masterpiece to savor. Night forests (delirious/fairied) juxtaposed Versailles formal gardens (topiaried/soldiered) , a marriage of nature made and man made. Lush pixie dusted cul-de-sacs, concrete spired churches, separated by a mysterious dark grey river. Smokey mountain clouds. Pearl armed gowns, gold leafed jackets, quail feathers, assymetrical war paint. It's an endless procession of spectacle. You have to see it so you can just be blown away by the shots, camera work and angles. Off the chart artistry and technicals! All of this backdrop sets the stage of the understory of co-existence. Bridging the Gap. Can we relook and forgive to forge a new alliance? How did we end up at opposite ends? What's the cost? How many mistakes? How many betrayals. Who? Why? So many missteps by the characters bc of the narrowness of their personal desires and aspirations are contrary to everyone else they end up in conflict. Elliptical mirrors out of focus. Nothing can move forward without some one at some point ""forgiving"" And a Mother's Love, whether Human, Fairy, or Mother Nature's can be the most unconditional forgiving in existence. This is the discussionary journey each character unknowningly is on and unknowingly having with theirselves. How can I react to this with all I know and don't know, and what will I lose or gain. Heady stuff for Disney, but it's there. Endearing without being syrupy sentimentality. No kookiness. No reliance on a cute card. Just aces. Angela Jolie and Michelle Pfieffer, both bring to life the necessary passion and compassion for their sharp deeply focussed portrayals. Never clunky, garish, overplayed ~ on target with finesse, panache, and crackling charisma. They could have been shticky, not here. They carry their anchored characters effortlessly. This is a Disney film and is successful at that Disney exuberance. And a happy healthy ending. Ta-daa! Sometimes Disney Films get censored down that they loose the turbulence life presents ... but here they get the balance just so right. They don't beat you over the head with the situations each character is struggling with. Simple self-preservation. Will you lie, cheat, steal, betray or be truthful, compete fairly, be loyal in that self preservationistic plight? This is life's dharma: our behavior. To be fair, it's the contrapuntal acting duo of Jolie and Pfeiffer that elevate the story experience. The supporting cast does fine, we feel them but without the feisty spirited duo, it would have been just a nice film. Alot of development went into each theme, and each facet could be its own film. The editing is exemplary in folding each theme on each other, causing the many revolving relationships to shine as a whole. You can feel there is a lot of story, scenes and film left out on the editing floor that will end up in a sequel. All ages will cherry pick the takeaways from film, there is something for everyone. It is a G film with an all around ""A"". Hats off to Disney for the sensitive evocative story of healing by forgiveness, acceptance and allowing loved ones and ourselves to make mistakes and fail. And revise ourselves to rise up again.",Maleficent: Mistress of Evil,Maleficent: Mistress of Evil - Movie Reviews

8268,Cris K,"Sep 20, 2020","Great watch, would watch again, and can recommend. This was a very impressive sequel to the original. I'm sure it had something to do with low expectations, ""What are they going to do to follow THAT....ohhhh"". It's probably the first time I've registered a large scale battle like this movie has since....I guess ""Infinity War"", but ""Lord of the Rings"" seems more apt as it is a fantasy movie as well. What's really odd is that this movie has too many story lines, but still manages to balance them acceptably. It also goes the extra mile to explore the angle of ""it doesn't matter how different we are, but what we do with our potential"" sort of thing. There are race traitors, and true examples of evil disregard for life. Michelle Pfieffer really owns her role as an evil queen, and sure they go into backstory to give a modicum of justification, but she gets into death in a very psychotic fashion, not to mention the page. While the most charming part of the movie is the most boring, unity and peace, it is amazing at the great lengths people will go to prevent such a thing, and that's really the movie that you're watching here: someone going to every length to be a hero, and just being a jerk instead.

8274,JOHN U,"Aug 25, 2021","Climactic ending? Sure. Good movie? Eh, it was alright. A few things diminished my enjoyment of this movie to less than the first two. Firstly, the fact that the colonel didn't just kill Caesar right off the bat really bugged me. It wouldn't have been that much of a problem but his capture, though integral to his character arc, took way too much of the runtime and got less and less believable as time went on. Also the escape was too easy and didn't have any sort of tension or anything. Second, I was expecting something a little more tangibly climactic with the plot of this film. Yes, it was good to end on Caesar finally leading his people to a home of safety and it was pointed to realize that that was his purpose all along but aside from a line of dialogue here and there, I didn't pick up on the journey of the apes to a new home as one of much importance until the very end. That was my problem with this movie in general. More than it's predecessors, things just happen and they'll have a reason down the road but they don't have a logical reason to have occurred. I was expecting more than just a sequence of events plot. Even if the plot takes a step down, I think that the overall narrative remains true, even if the thematic elements aren't as clearly fleshed out. There were interesting new ideas (Novas, donkeys, and other signs of the worlds shifting) incredible new set pieces, the performances, visuals and digital effects were just as good as always and better but overall, the narrative punch was scattershot to me and had a weaker impact than the last two. Caesar stands out once again as the focal point but he can't hold this movie entirely together, it's become too big for him and maybe that's how it always had to be. The series outgrew it's main character on purpose and ended at the parting of ways. For me personally, it weakened the experience but I suppose, made for a better outcome. Caesar's journey is the natural last step in his arc but I was frustrated by the portrayal. It wasn't bad by any means I just didn't feel connected like I had before. The old familiar characters were there but it just didn't have the weight to me. I still loved Maurice. He was even more kind, more loyal and even more awesome and he didn't die in the end. This was truly an awe inspiring ending and overall a satisfying one but I suppose I wanted something a little more dynamic. I guess what we learned is leave humans alone and they'll kill each other. Run into the hills and be free. Ok then. I'll give this movie credit, it was quite an achievement. I just didn't totally buy it.",War for the Planet of the Apes,War for the Planet of the Apes - Movie Reviews

Where we knew what Revenge Of The Sith had to go in order to set up A New Hope, we all knew where this one had to go to match up with Charlton Hestons (or Mark Wahlbergs) Planet Of The Apes movie. The maij difference between the 2 is that War didn't feel like it was shoehorned in to match up where ROTS did. Woody Harrelson gives us a style of him we haven't seen since Natural Born Killers (absolutely ruthless and dark). This may be the only trilogy ever made where a single one can't be knocked as bad or decent, the consistency of greatness these films have is something big franchises should look to for years to come.

8312,Matchell C,"Oct 24, 2021","'Shrek' is such a classic movie, you basically haven't experienced life without seeing it at least ounce. On the outside, 'Shrek' is a pretty funny movie that mocks Disney. But it also has elements of a very intelligent love story, with a moral that is portrayed in such a brilliant way. The story follows an ogre named Shrek, who lives alone in a swamp, and he was happy that way. Until one day his swamp has been overrun by fairy tale creatures, that were banished there by the maniacal lord Farquaad. So Shrek has to get his land back by going on a quest with a donkey (named Donkey) to rescue a princess. Though a simple plot, it makes up for this with its lovable characters, and comedy. The main character, Shrek, is really funny, and his growth throughout the movie is beautiful. Shrek takes a-lot of punches through out the movie, as he gets his heart torn apart, and judged by everyone. But Shrek kept going, and by the end of the movie, Shrek finds what true love really is. Donkey, while not as funny, still got a few chuckles out of me. Fiona is a crucial part of the plot, as she first comes across to Shrek and the audience as this generic princess, but when she hears Shrek talking to Donkey about his feelings, Fiona softens up towards Shrek, and she starts showing her personality. Shrek then starts liking Fiona for who she is. I also really liked the main villain, lord Farquaad. Literally everything he says is memorable, thanks to how the voice actor delivered his lines. He is also a pretty big threat towards Shrek and Fiona's relationship. All of the main characters play their parts effectively, and none of them feel like they're sitting on the side lines, if you know what I mean. 'Shrek' also has an excellent soundtrack, that is too quite memorable. The reason why I couldn't give this movie a perfect score was due to the pacing at the start feeling a little off, and the animation can be a-bit jarring at times. But other then that, this movie is a masterpiece, I highly recommend it.",Shrek,Shrek - Movie Reviews
8313,Sean M,"Oct 23, 2021","Like many say, Shrek is indeed one of the greatest animated films of all time. Everything about the film is done perfectly in its own unique way. Shrek is a great relatable character for literally the majority of the world, the story is really funny and even emotional, the other characters like Donkey, and Fiona have amazing character. The animation looks pretty good for its time, the voice acting by Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy fit their roles for Shrek and Donkey so flawlessly, and the soundtrack is beautiful. The message is also probably one of the deepest of all time in cinema history. Shrek is an important film and one of my top animated films out there. It deserves the attention it gets.",Shrek,Shrek - Movie Reviews
8314,Pedro G,"Oct 21, 2021","Excelente película, una obra maestra de la animación. Desde chico me encanta esta película y al volverla a ver es igual que como la recordaba. Salida en una época donde su competencia estaba ya en lo alto, DreamWorks hizo esta obra maestra que todos recuerdan. En cuanto al ritmo, va de una forma normal y tranquila, pero eso no evita que haya momentos de verdadera acción cuando se debe. La fotografía es muy buena, tiene unas tomas geniales con el ángulo perfecto, lo cual nos sumerge en la historia. La música es excelente y muy única. El villano no es para tanto pero bueno, cumple. Por otro lado, me gustó como ejecutaron el drama en los momentos que se usa. Luego esta lo mejor, el doblaje latino, que la mejora muchísimo la película y hace chistes únicos. El guion es muy original, además nos lleva a ver una historia genial, cómica y muy emotiva. También su historia se encarga de romper con clichés, hacer un chistes para adultos y darnos frases memorables. Tiene un gran mensaje, y tiene muchas cosas por analizar. La animación no es la cosa más fluida del mundo pero eso ayuda a que tenga su propio estilo y muchas partes están súper simpáticas. En conclusión, Shrek es una obra maestra, con bromas infantiles para unos y bromas adultas para otros, con una historia muy entretenida, y un mensaje muy lindo.

8334,Puroo R,"Jul 11, 2021","As a kid I hated Shrek. He looked ugly, the animation wasn't exactly what I'd call 'gorgeous', and the little me couldn't tolerate seeing a princess beat up soldiers (I know, it happens in Shrek 2 and Shrek the Third but I couldn't tell the difference). So I finally watched it when I had nothing better to watch, just to see what all happens in it and why exactly does everyone meme it so much. Turns out the little me was dumb. This is a perfect animated movie for anyone who appreciates a good sense of humour. Shrek is a story about the eponymous ogre who lives in a swamp, always wanting to be left alone. It's a parody of a fairy tale, so just like them the villagers often try to attack him, only to be scared away. Shrek is the opposite of what we see in our fairy tale hero - he's ugly, he's disgusting, he's an outcast, he belongs to the species whom the fairy tale hero kills. But Shrek does not care about what people think about him, or he did until he and Donkey went to slay the dragon and rescue Princess Fiona so that Lord Farquaad would return him his swamp. The message the movie gives us is that looks can be deceiving. Shrek is afraid no one will like him because he is just an ugly ogre, Donkey believes everyone thinks he's stupid because he's a donkey, Princess Fiona does not want anyone to see him at night because she turns into an ogre herself. Even in the end when the spell breaks and she sees herself in the ogre form, she is confused since she thought she will finally get rid of her curse, but it turned out the opposite is true. The dragon also seemed to be ferocious until Donkey asked her out. Shrek makes a perfect use of parody imagery throughout the movie. There is the Mama Bear from Goldilocks who has been killed and turned into a rug, there's Ginger Bread Man whose feet have been broken, the Magic Mirror describes Snow White in a double meaning manner, there are magical animals who are traded by the soldiers etc. That combined with the magical world and the moral that it gives, all of these elements combine to make a very fable-like story. It actually feels like this could be a bedtime story that would have been told in the medieval era if they were as progressive as us. I liked Shrek so much that I already watched it twice: Once while watching it on my own and once to show it to my sister. I really wish they make more of these. Shrek alone is better than all the other animated films made nowadays combined. I could have given it even more stars if it were possible. It makes me nostalgic and it makes me laugh.

Shrek tells the story of an ogre called Shrek who engages in the traditional fairy tale story of saving a princess with a sidekick. This film famously subverts fairy tale tropes and is a satire exploring the deep themes of beauty and appearance, love, and friendship as well as not judging a book by its cover. Feauring the stellar voices of comedians Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, and John Litgow who bring these characters to life. But is the voice of Eddie Murphy as Donkey who blows it out of the park with Murphy's signature humor some of it which would fly over with kids. The film has great heart and is incredibly fun as it makes fun of the fantasy genre and is quite edgy at times not being afraid to do that in a family movie.

8374,Matthew D,"Jun 14, 2020","A day in the life of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's marriage. Doug Liman's action romantic comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) is a crazy meta comedy about Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's marriage. Simon Kinberg's script is pretty funny with all these real life references to Pitt and Jolie's legendary relationship and celebrity. However his cheesy one liners and average romance writing is only possible because of Pitt and Jolie's real chemistry and excellent delivery. William Fichtner is funny as the marriage counselor too by the way. ""Brangelina"" were so famous that Mr. & Mrs. Smith was going to be a hit no matter what, but it's still a fairly decent movie. Plenty of exciting gunfire and a few memorable fights. The overall assassination plot is dumb, but you're watching for Brad and Angelina's charismatic lead performances. Liman's interesting direction makes all the espionage and action entertaining. I do wonder if Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie will ever get back together as they seemed like a nice couple. But, you never know what a marriage is really like unless you're in it. Micheal Tronick's editing is all over the place with erratic action cuts in the middle of romantic scenes and dramatic cuts in the middle of action sequences. He makes Mr. & Mrs. Smith's 120 minute run-time feels a lot longer. Bojan Bazelli's cinematography is very pretty. Everything looks like a clothing ad thanks to Michael Kaplan, Linda Matthews, and Toby Bronson's costumes and Deborah La Mia Denaver and Lisa Buono's make-up choices. What else can be said about Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie? They are both gorgeous, funny, stylish, and exciting as lead actors. They completely steal the show in Mr. & Mrs. Smith.

I didn't particularly love ""The Da Vinci Code"" movie, but I was able to have more fun with that movie. This movie feels longer than it is due to inconsistent pacing and I felt like it really dragged.

8414,Jacob B,"Sep 29, 2019","With higher stakes, better pacing, more action and being different from its source material yet still faithful to the main story of the book, Angels & Demons is an improvement on the previous Dan Brown adaptation (though considering that A&D was the first book in the Robert Langdon series, maybe this movie being better was a given, even if their were a decent amount of changes, most notably, Ron Howard deciding not to make this movie a prequel to The Da Vinci Code) though the story is rather implausible with a hilariously absurd climax that, even with the changes, lent itself better to the page than it did to the big screen. Plus, the movie's more faithful aspects also extend to Dan Brown's inaccurate research and dialogue that sounds more like a Wikipedia article rather than plot-important exposition for the audience's sake.

Although unfortunately has bad score in the criticism and was not widely accepted by various circumstances, it is still important to recognize that this film not only attracts a conspiratorial public, also a scientific or agnostic public could enjoy this exciting film of mistery and conspiracy theories. Here you can also find important values, such as the importance of studies and preservation, since these are the keys used by these characters to solve the whole problem that involved the destruction of the Vatican and the murder of those who involved the Papacy, besides, they demonstrate as a great power that the human being has at his disposition, which serves to solve the most difficult problems that exist in life. However, the internal conflict that these characters face is ignorance, since they have to solve an ancestral mystery, which only the Illuminati knew in their hidden society. Also in the Climax you will find great answers to your doubts, and you will learn in detail about the Papacy and the Catholic Church in the past , and you will be able to learn about important theories implanted within the church about the feared and powerful sect of the Illuminatis .",SHOW MORE,Angels & Demons,Angels & Demons - Movie Reviews

The final act does a good job bringing it all together and giving you the warm-fuzzies by the end. Jim Carrey does a great job in the title role with his over reactions putting us in his shoes really well. I believe I will forever see Morgan Freeman whenever I picture God from now on.

8510,Cris K,"Jun 28, 2020","This is a good example of putting together a great cast of celebrities, who aren't even that bad of voice actors and the experience feels awkward. I don't know if the voice direction was poor or if the voices just didn't fit the characters, like a bad dub of anime. The worst part of this is just that it's about birds. Most of the bird characters feel cheap, except the main 3, and it's hard to get invested in them on any serious level. That might be the key though, taking this movie serious on any level might be the mistake. The writing is actually pretty good, complete with pivotal moments, a complex villain, a heap of mad circumstance, and beautifully constructed relationships between characters. It really is like a great writer got saddled with a premise and just angrily crafted something passable out some exec's daughter's fascination with birds. It's a good movie, and I will likely throw it on again in the future, but it'll probably be with an, ""Oh yeah, the BIRD movie..."". Can recommend.",Rio,Rio - Movie Reviews

The music is catchy, the animation is bright and full of colour, the voice acting is good and there is also a fair bit of comedy for all ages. Oh and, uh, there's some fanservice of sorts. I know it says rated G and there was even that instance where after they got a PG rating, executives were having none of it and edited some footage to be rerated G on appeal but if your children are wondering what's that thing expanding in their...uh...you get the idea. I feel sorry for Blue Sky because they have such a poor reputation as ""the company that milks out Ice Age sequels"" that the original movies sandwiched in between get overlooked.

I'm talking, of course, about the Omaha beach landings, not the cold opening of a veteran visiting a grave (I don't want to give anything away there). It remains one of the most astonishing pieces of film making ever put to screen, and what is impressive about the film is that the key battle scenes throughout, shot in the mud and filth of desecrated rural France are every bit as focused. There is a very loose connection between the plot and a real life tale, and if there is a criticism of Saving Private Ryan it is perhaps its opening and closing. It adds an emotional heft that doesn't really need to be there in my opinion. But it's a small quibble, and Saving Private Ryan remains an incredible piece of film making, one that Spielberg backed up in the genre by going on to produce Band Of Brothers (2001) and The Pacific (2010).",Saving Private Ryan,Saving Private Ryan - Movie Reviews

8577,JOHN U,"Aug 25, 2021","I think this film benefits greatly from the low expectations the idea of another reboot to a talking ape franchise creates. I know I personally had no clue what this movie was going to do and even littler clue of how it was going to do it. Add in my preexisting knowledge of the trilogy dynamic and coming in I was rolling the dice on my enjoyment of this film. Though the shock may come from the low expectations, I can safely say that it was shockingly incredible. Let's just get the regular stuff this movie nailed out of the way. The cinematography, special effects, music and even performances were all surprisingly great. The way the film palpably speeds up little by little until it comes to a conclusion that is roaring full throttle is an excellent use of a tight 90-minute runtime. I think what makes this film so amazingly special is not just it's inclusion of intelligent apes but the way the plot focuses almost entirely on them and in particular, Caesar. Caesar is the anchor around which the whole film comes together. Without him, this wouldn't have been half the experience. Every time I looked at Caesar, I was dumbfounded at the intelligence so apparent on his face. What Caesar is to the film, so his face is to his character and here comes the incomparable Andy Serkis, making history again as he and a visual effects team on the cutting edge bring another unlikely character to life. It is that life, that look in Caesar's eyes, the way he twirls a twig between his fingers, his focus and his piercing stare create a riveting new protagonist for a unique and incredible story. And that was all that needed to be done. From the get-go I was completely invested in Caesar's story and wonder of wonders, I found myself much more invested and much more interested in his scenes that contain no dialogue then the scenes with the human characters. Caesar's journey is riveting to watch as he uses his wits to gain more and more control of himself, his fellow apes and the humans around them. I was blown away, my jaw dropped when Caesar says his first word and I was struck in his final scene with James Franco to see that he was standing just as straight and tall as his former caregiver. To expound on that scene (and the gripping third act rampage) another great achievement of this film is bringing Caesar to his ultimate destiny as head of the new tribe of intelligent Apes. It's a great Sci-fi achievement to make such a foreboding event as apes striking back as one that is made as a strike for justice. I can't wait to see how this is all fleshed out more in the next two films. And yet this movie walks the line, Caesar must leave behind that bad but also the good things humans have done for him and at least at this point, he is by no means perfectly commendable in all his actions (though the human touch does lend him compassion, an essential step on the path to humanity as it were). All in all, this is excellent science fiction that uses it's unique angle to tell an engaging and enthralling story rather than explore philosophical themes to deeply and that is completely fine by me. Man, I didn't see that coming. What a ride",Rise of the Planet of the Apes,Rise of the Planet of the Apes - Movie Reviews

Mixed: This is not a film for everyone as some people (who are sensitive to Animals in cages) might be scared with Animals in cages and abused (as the some of the humans dont care id the Animals die), this is a mature emotional thematic film which might be too much for sensitive viewers Overall: This is a magnificent film that any one who likes sci-fi drama should check this out Grade: A Entertainment scale: 9.7",Rise of the Planet of the Apes,Rise of the Planet of the Apes - Movie Reviews

They did an impeccable job eliciting emotional responses to the characters and the general sense of direction the movie had felt adroitly handled. Everything down to the casting was top-notch: Lithgow made a fantastic Alzheimer's dad, for example. Having watched the previous 6 apes movies I was relieved that they didn't rely on guys in monkey costumes and instead showed the apes as they are in real life for the most part. The catalysts to Caesar's mistreatment did start to come off like an idiot plot as the misunderstandings would be difficult to make in real life, but that's the only criticism I have.

I felt the movie was paced a bit too quickly. CGI is great. Cesar's facial expressions tell it all! You feel his rage, his fear, and his child like innocence through his wonderfully animated eyes. There were a bit too many plot jumps in the last 30 minutes, but all in all, it was directed very, very well.

Ao tratar assuntos como racismo, preconceito e até mesmo evolucionismo - no que se diz respeito a superioridade intelectual, o personagem e sua premissa se tornam muito propensas a empatia. E como eu não poderia deixar de mencionar, a melhor cena do filme, onde o Cesar fala ""NÃO"" é magnificamente bem construída. Com um suspense, fotografia e tensão extremamente bem alinhados. Lembro de me arrepiar todo. Como um todo, a fotografia é muito boa, apresentando uma geografia muito boa do local no qual os primatas escapam. A ost é igualmente bem aplicada.

Home Alone 1 and Home Alone 2 were good and I enjoyed them both, but when Home Alone 3 and 4 came out I think that's when the Home Alone franchise was just killed. I don't think anyone could replace Macaulay Culkin as the main kid who is Home Alone. So because Home Alone 3 and Home Alone 4 were bad I didn't expect this film to be much better and unfortunately I was correct it, this film was no better than the previous 2 films. Pete Hewitt directed this film and he also directed Garfield and that really worried me. I didn't dislike Garfield but I wasn't impressed either.

Just when you thought Drac's predictable character development has finally passed by and you can stop disliking him for his selfish needs, this out of nowhere villain appears to give the movie a climax, and it all ends with a lame-ass fight scene with overexaggerated animation that makes the action more stilted than engaging.",Hotel Transylvania 2,Hotel Transylvania 2 - Movie Reviews

It was cleared up but I don't like how far the creepy flying goblin thing went. We should be encouraging children to embrace feelings and the child's character loved that ""monster"" on TV and it should be encouraged. I also felt there should have been a stronger response to the characters that mocked him for liking that ""monster"". We also need to show kids that it's wrong to bully or to think they're cool for not liking stuff that seems kind and fun.

The final fight is very emotional and intense, and the action is done much better in this film. The worldbuilding continues to be superb, and the CGI continues to be great for its time, though it does fail to hold up to today's standards. However, where I think this film is worse than its predecessors is in its story and plot with the second Death Star, which feels unoriginal and familiar. There are also many more plot holes throughout the film when compared to the previous installments and the film have a few more clichés in it.

8700,Jonathan K,"Oct 15, 2021","While this movie isn't as perfect as the first two, it is genuinely excellent, contrary to what many would say (for reasons I'm not entirely sure). The characters are every bit as well-written and likeable as in the preceding films, the story is still engaging (if just a bit thin, as it's ultimately an extended Third Act of the over-arching story), the villains are still immensely intimidating, the music is still wonderful and the action sequences are still awesome. Heck, from an action standpoint, this might be the best of the three, as the Climax is very long, featuring both a Ground Battle and a Space Battle, alongside a third based on Story Resolution, and despite the >30 minute duration, this climax NEVER loses momentum. While this movie doesn't have the depth of the first two, it does escalate everything that worked before, and because of this, the emotional catharsis from the climax of this movie is sublime -- I honestly can't think of any other Action series that ends with such a perfect emotional satisfaction. It's well-written, well-directed and has both adrenaline and sincerity, and apart from an overlong first act, I cannot think of a better way this borderline-perfect Trilogy could have ended.",Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,Star Wars: Episode VI -- Return of the Jedi - Movie Reviews

8707,James M,"Aug 25, 2021","Twice, maybe, but is it possible to create the Star Wars magic a third time? Lucas said yes and, gratefully, we agree. Star Wars Return of the Jedi is the conclusion to the trilogy we all hoped for. More of what we loved, without resorting to more of the same. Lucas dreamt up even more exotic new places to show us, such as the forest moon of Endor, exciting new creatures for us to behold, such as Jabba the Hutt and the Ewoks, and plenty of thrilling new action sequences, including the rescue of Han Solo from Jabba's Palace, the speeder bike chase on Endor and the battle against the new Death Star. The plot is simple but effective, resolving many of the questions we were left with after Return of the Jedi and ending with the penultimate battle between good and evil in the re-match between Luke and Vader (spoiler alert: good always wins). We get to see more of the Emperor and to understand more of Vader's life as a Sith Lord, and to appreciate the internal conflict he felt towards his son. The special effects and sound effects were once again great - nothing particularly new, but we didn't need them to be new, just reliably great. All of the cast return, and you can tell that they have grown comfortable with their respective roles in the intervening years. There are no boring bits, it's just another exhilarating adventure that we almost feel part of as we join the ragtag band of rebels as they race across the Star Wars galaxy.",Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,Star Wars: Episode VI -- Return of the Jedi - Movie Reviews

8728,Puroo R,"Jun 30, 2021","Now before you rush ahead and quickly mark my review unhelpful, hear me out alright? Return of the Jedi is the only movie of the trilogy I had no hopes from. I had heard of people saying that it's the worst in the series. But considering I got bored from A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back I thought this one is going to be even worse (why I got bored of them, that's written on their reviews. But still if you're too lazy to check it's because I always somehow get bored watching old movies). So I had absolutely no expectations from it. Turns out it has the most story of all the Star Wars movies. The movie began with answering the question as to what happened to Han Solo. He gets rescued by Luke and Leia. We even get to see the iconic Boba Fett in that scene. Later on we get to see Lando. Even though I haven't heard about him and I actually had to look up his name while writing this review, he looks pretty iconic. I don't know if this was a popular look or this movie made the look popular, but I guess the latter is true. There were many other NPC characters throughout the movie, but for me the selling point were the Ewoks. And I don't care what all the ""die-hard Star Wars fanboys"" say. The Ewoks are so adorable! I wanted to pull their cheeks. Their scenes were so cute and funny. The way they fought the Stormtroopers or treated C3PO like a messiah was really wholesome. I really wanted to see that kind of stuff in Star Wars movies. Just because it's set in space doesn't mean it always has to blast out laser guns or have huge flying ships. After all, it's set long long ago in a galaxy far far away. There could be many tribes living over there as well. And seeing them hold up makes me believe they still exist somewhere in today's time, having evolved into becoming teddy bears as advanced as humans. And finally Darth Vader's final fight scene in this movie, in my opinion, was way better than The Empire Strikes Back. We actually get to see what Darth Vader looks like, and he hasn't cut Luke's arm for this. This is the correct way of drawing out emotions. The one who is making the audience emotional should be in pain, and not the one being made emotional. Darth Sidious was really intimidating, and I really wanted more of him rather than the trash that Palpatine was. Star Wars: Episode VI is even today my favourite Star Wars movie. It doesn't matter what others say about it, it's gonna be the most OP in my opinon. In just 2.5 hours it managed to tell more story than the entire sequel trilogy combined. And the best part - the spoilers from this movie aren't even as popular as Episode IV or V, so I could watch it without already knowing what I'm about to watch. I'd absolutely watch it again.",Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,Star Wars: Episode VI -- Return of the Jedi - Movie Reviews

Recientemente vi la película de 1971 y honestamente creo que es muy inferior a esta en muchos aspectos, de verdad no disfruto mucho de la versión de Gene Wilder. Creo que Tim Burton hizo un mejor trabajo al capturar la historia con su estilo y comedia. Creo que Johnny Depp fue el mejor actor que pudieron elegir para el papel de Willy Wonka sin lugar a dudas. La película fue divertida, todas las locaciones están muy bien hechas y realmente se nota todo el trabajo que hay detrás. También se disfrutan las diferentes canciones que cantaron los Oompa Loompas.

8737,Smiley V,"Sep 08, 2021","Awful on so many levels. There's no contrast between Charlie's ""normal"" world and the Chocolate Factory. Everything is dark, twisted and creepy. Speaking of creepy, Johnny Depp's characterization as Willy Wonka is at best off-putting. Unlike Gene Wilder who was eccentric but at his core human, Depp comes across as a psychopath with no relatable human characteristics. He looks at the children with at best, disdain. The songs are GOD AWFUL, being chaotic, clamorous, melody-less over done set pieces with awful CGI. Everything is always dark of course. Speaking of CGI there's way too much of it and the color tone for the movie is grayish blue for the most part. It's dismal, dreary and more suited for a horror movie than a child's fantasy. Grandpa Joe is there and has no personality or purpose in this film unlike the wonderful Jack Albertson performance from the original. But the worst is Charlie Bucket. I could not give a damn about this character, he's not interesting, he's not sympathetic, he's just there. The fault lies squarely on the shoulders of Director Tim Burton. He relied much too much on visual effects for entertainment and forgot to give us characters we care about. As the original Willy Wonka, Gene Wilder said, this movie is an insult. Charmless and a burden to sit through.",Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory - Movie Reviews

The plot is exciting and infinitely-variable. The film had the perfect cast. The film stars Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka and Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket, alongside David Kelly, Helena Bonham Carter, Noah Taylor, Missi Pyle, James Fox, Deep Roy, and Christopher Lee.

This cinematic remake that is supposed to closely follow that of the original Roald Dahl story, will leave you speechless…or covered in trash. It is every child's dream to tour a candy factory where everything is edible. Then there being a special prize at the end for a child who makes it. Let your inner child run free as well as your imagination during this film. Imagine drinking from a chocolate river or tasting a full course meal in a single piece of gum. This bright, sugar-coated, twisted movie hides teaching moments behind a candy land. It shows the right and wrong way to act, and ultimately how parents have failed. The music in the movie is upbeat but the words have an ominous undertone. The camera work certainly captures all the angles which draws you in. The scenes make the child inside of you want to be in the movie yourself. The overview shot of the factory is a child's dream come true. The catchy songs will get stuck in your head, but the words are thought provoking. ""Augustus Gloop, Augustus Gloop, a great big greedy nincompoop"" this line personally shows why he meet this fate. He was greedy and possibly not smart enough to think of the consequences of his actions. I personally love this movie because of the way the children's manners relate to their ending. The way the child who chews gum competitively chews her last piece and turns into a blueberry. Another being a glutton and almost drowning in chocolate because he can't stop his urge. Suddenly the children all start meeting their demise, but in ways almost expected my Willy Wonka himself. How did he know that only four goggles would be needed in the tv room? How can he not know which key unlocks a gate in his own factory? The plot along with the movie all bring together the twisted story of Charlie Bucket. Enjoy watching Jonny Depp be a chocolatier and Deep Roy be Oompa Loompas and realize the twisted intentions with every scene.

8773,Aidan B,"Nov 18, 2021","A fun way to conclude this trilogy, ""The Last Crusade"" introduces Connery into the blend of amazing actors, and he ends up carrying this movie. The comedy is done extremely well, and the action is still pleasing to watch. The story is fun and goofy, yet it never gets too goofy in its tone. About the only real issue I can even make is that it still doesn't feel that original, but that is easily overshadowed by the stellar performances and the delightful banter between both Jones.

8775,Jonathan K,"Nov 02, 2021","While this isn't as perfectly cathartic as Raiders or as intense and daring as Temple of Doom, Last Crusade is probably the most thoroughly plotted and well-plotted of the trilogy, ending this near-perfect trilogy on a worthy note. It looks and sounds just as great as the first two movies, has the same blend of action, worldbuilding and humor, and in some ways it surpasses the other two in these respects. Additionally, the introduction of Sean Connery as Indiana Jones' father was a brilliant move, and the fact that he's a well-realized and immensely flawed character, yet likable nonetheless, only serves to add to the movie's strengths. Throw in a more versatile change of landscapes from Act to Act, some fantastic adrenaline rush moments and a surprisingly thoughtful and emotional climax, and you've got a movie that is a genuinely excellent work of cinema on its own merits, even without taking the first two into account. It works as both a popcorn-munching Blockbuster level, and it works as more of a ""thinking man's"" movie as well, and it works brilliantly as both.",Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade - Movie Reviews

8779,Thomas R,"Sep 26, 2021","Basically this is a remake of ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"": Indiana Jones must beat the Nazis to obtaining the holy relic. The main differences are a lack of strong villains, and the inclusion of Indy's father in the story. Unfortunately Sean Connery and Harrison Ford are not convincing as father and son. The original film was an exciting roller-coaster ride, a remake of 1930's- style exotic adventures. This is the same without the excitement, or any good characters. Even the sword fight which takes place here to make up for the lack of one in the original (because rumor has it that Harrison Ford was too ill at the time to perform it) is tired and unexciting, as is the rest of the movie.

This film was nominated for 3 Oscars in 1990 and they won one Oscar for the best sound mixing. The film is set in Venice, Egypt and probably Greece. It was shot on location. The location with its mountains and forests is really unforgettable. The story describes the search for Holy Grail which archaeologist Indiana Jones and the Nazis both found.

It's really wholesome and well-developed. The actiom sequences are remarkable (especially the ending) and out of the 3 80s movies, this easily has the most interesting and fun concept for a story and it mostly executes it well and I love the European setting for this movie. As a fan of the fast pace and dark tone of Temple of Doom, I was partly disappointed with the lighter and slower pace of the movie (Damn you critics!) and I think the central conflict gets lost with the stuff with Indy and his dad but it's still an excellent movie",Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade - Movie Reviews

But the real reason this film works so amazingly well is the chemistry between Sean Connery and Harrison Ford - a perfect combination of wit and heartwarmth. Some moments don't work quite as well, but the Third Act is top action movie stuff, and the Holy Grail makes for the best maguffin in any of the Indy films.

8836,James J,"Oct 11, 2021","Another problematic end, just like Chapter 1 (book and movie). The Horror - 5 stars: ""It"" can take the form of everyone's greatest fear so the horror here is about as horrific as can be. The Hook/Pace - ZERO stars: I found the opening scene (gay-bashing) just ugly as it had nothing to do with anything, was never resolved, and I almost turned this one off. And the run time is almost three hours. There is a reason the best comedies and best horror films run under two hours: that's usually the limit of genre premises. The Jumps/Scares - 3 stars: Very effective jump-out-of your seat blindsides for the first half, maybe a dozen good to great ones. But after a while they become numbing and repetitive. The Film - 2: Some very nice humanity/friendships here but the movie is much too long and some plot lines are unresolved. Final special effects laughable. The End - Zero Stars: All through this movie there is a running joke about bad endings (""Chapter 1"" end laughably absurd). But we get the same stupid ending!!!... only magnified and bloodier. Summary - 2.2. I can only hope Chapter 3 finally ends as it should. I know what it should be, I know Stephen King knows, so I think it's coming.

8848,Pedro G,"Sep 03, 2021","Me parece una muy buena película, salvo por algunos fallos pero siento que la criticaron bastante sin merecerlo. Si bien lo que hace que esta secuela funcione es el compromiso que estos actores hacen para transmitir la sensación de que son los mismos niños que vimos en la película anterior, pero aún necesitan terminar con el mal de una vez por todas. Por mucho, el mejor fue Bill Hader, le dio la vida a la película que necesitaba cuando se volvía lenta. Por otro lado, James Ransone es, literalmente, Eddie en persona dentro de veinte años; ambos juntos elevan la película a nuevas alturas. En esta secuela, Pennywise es más un matón, pero fue visualmente interesante ver con qué jugó Bill Skarsgård esta vez. Es un gran actor y ver algunos trucos nuevos fue divertido.

8858,Joo G,"Jul 16, 2021","After watching this movie, it made me realize how good the first movie is. I mean, this second part is not bad, but it fails in some parts and even repeats mistakes from the first film, such as using the same fright formula, where it ends up being predictable when the film intends to scare us. However he still manages sometimes. Another problem is that the character development, which was done so well in chapter 1, is not equally good in this one, as the film invests in the characters revisiting the past, and the problem is that we've already been introduced to their younger versions. .. I saw a review video (channel ""super 8"") and in it the guy says that ""It chapter two"" looks like an extended version of ""It chapter one"", and I agree, the movie might fall into a feeling that it has to match height of what was the success of the first and is lost a little. But, I'm not just critical of the movie. He, like the first one, is a solid film and manages to employ a good atmosphere, especially when investing in a psychological horror. The cast is also really good, making it really feel like we're really watching an older version of those youngsters from the first movie. It is worth mentioning the performance of James McAvoy, who indulges in the role, and the duo Bill Hader and James Ransone, who serve very well as a comedic relief (something that is well done in the film). In short, despite some bad choices of direction, I liked the movie and it was good entertainment, offering enough for anyone who liked the first one or looking for a horror movie to watch.",It Chapter Two,It: Chapter Two - Movie Reviews

8866,Pro G,"Nov 09, 2021","Jaws Movie Review Did you know sharks kill an average of 10 people a year, worldwide? Now, imagine eight shark kills in a single week! Yesterday, I watched a Steven Spielberg classic, Jaws. Jaws is about a killer Great White Shark that is attacking swimmers off the coast of a fictional island called Amity, which is off the coast of New England. The acting is great, with many award winning actors, including Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss, and Robert Shaw. Roy Sheider plays Martin Brody, the star of the movie, and the local sheriff of Amity. Martin is from New York, but moves to Amity with his family because he feels that in a small town, he has more of an impact on preventing crime. ""'I'm tellin' ya, the crime rate in New York will kill ya. There's so many problems, you never feel like you're accomplishing anything. Violence, rip-offs, muggings. The kids can't leave the house. You gotta walk 'em to school. But in Amity, one man can make a difference. In twenty-five years, there's never been a shooting or a murder in this town."" Quote from Martin Brody. An ironic detail about Martin Brody is that he is afraid of the water, even though he is the one (spoiler alert!) who kills the shark in the end. Richard Dreyfuss plays a leading role as an oceanographer named Matt Hooper, who specializes in sharks, and helps track down the shark. Robert Shaw plays Quint, a professional shark hunter, who is strange but entertaining. He has a leading role in helping to kill the shark. The special effects in Jaws were not entirely accurate, but are still exceptionally impressive for a 1975 movie, and can even hold up to today's standards, as well as the rest of the movie. The suspense in Jaws is incredible, and the ominous, trademark, Jaws soundtrack plays every time the shark goes in for the kill. In my opinion, Jaws is an absolute masterpiece, because of it's great suspense, colorful characters, and awesomely gory kills. It has an excellent plot, nail biting suspense, and most importantly, never has a dull moment. Jaws is surprisingly scary for such an old movie, and ages like fine wine. Why should you trust me? I have been watching movies since I was 3, starting with Disney, all the way up to movies like Scream and The Bourne Identity. I have always loved raving, complaining, and watching movies. My family and I have had a Friday night movie night, and I have watched upwards of 350 movies.",Jaws,Jaws - Movie Reviews

The acting by Scheider, Dreyfuss, and Shaw is fantastic. This movie is decades old and still packs a cinematic punch despite (or arguably because of) the lack of modern-day special effects. This is the film that made me simultaneously terrified to swim in the ocean and completely fascinated by sharks.

John Williams's score is fantastic and the use of the Jaws theme to alert the presnece of the shark was really effective and the shark attacks are absolutely frightening and really well filmed and edited. Just hearing the hopelessness of the people is a great idea. Then the next 50 minutes comes along and it's not bad. The actors have good chemistry, seeing Quint go mad and Quint and Hooper exchanging stories and scars was cool and the way the shark was defeated was really satisfying. But it's just not interesting. There just isn't much going on and did this movie forget about an aftermath. Where is everyone's reaction to the shark getting killed and Quint is so unlikeable. I get it's the point but having to sit through him being a jerk for 50 minutes is painful. Still a great movie overall but it's kind of overrated.",Jaws,Jaws - Movie Reviews

Ralph, the 'bad guy' in the game 'Fix-it Felix Jr', is treated as such even when the arcade shuts down for the day, and the characters inside the arcade are brought to life in their own environment. It's a clever spin on the original Toy Story idea of toys coming to life, but choosing to shift the location to the inner world of a video arcade leads to some glorious cameos from characters you will recognise, and some you will be thrilled to meet for the first time. Although the initial thrill of exploring the world and its characters in the first half of the film does fade as the adventure fully gets going, Wreck-It Ralph is certainly one of Pixar's better films, and considering they've made very few that aren't excellent, that's high praise indeed.",Wreck-It Ralph,Wreck-It Ralph - Movie Reviews

And I know this is supposed to be for the children who are unable to raise their intelligence but that doesn't mean that the concept actually makes sense. In fact, no one's ever questioned the logic of why the arcade games plugged into the server are basically complete and different universes with everything being interactive for no reason at all, why code can directly infect another game after parting from its own, and why the game characters are separate code. And the message isn't conveyed logically because of that, since they're GAME CHARACTERS, they're programmed to play a role and shouldn't deviate from it because they can't, they were made for what they do. The basic ""Be yourself"" moral could not be conveyed in a worse way than this film. And never mind that, the soundtrack is faux-retro than actual retro. It's basically pop-retro over and over with the occasional Disney orchestral that has little weight because THE PREMISE IS ARCADE GAME CHARACTERS! If they're experiencing a misfortune, recall that they don't actually exist as people, were written for a string of events, and can't even leave the universe of technology itself because they would die trying to. Wreck-It Ralph is just gamer fan service for Disney and they know it, but they audience sure doesn't, and it's the only thing it actually succeeds in. Of course, because it is gamer fan service, that's where it has its entertainment value that actually can remain, unlike everything else that makes so little logical sense in hindsight that the audience won't even bother with it.",Wreck-It Ralph,Wreck-It Ralph - Movie Reviews
8910,Puroo R,"Jun 19, 2021","As a teenager I had once seen the trailer of this movie when I was at the hospital. Afterwards I never got to see this trailer ever again. I didn't know the name of the movie and we didn't have an internet back then, so I could neither ask anyone nor look it up. The trailer showing Bowser and Eggman were just enough to have me sold. Then when the movie released I saw its name in the newspaper, but within the next week it was taken off (probably it didn't earn much here). So ever since then I wanted to watch it. I finally watched it in 2018 and I'm really glad I could. Wreck-It Ralph is the story of a videogame villain who wants to be a hero, but he can't do it because of how much he's used to being the bad guy. After he meets Vanellope, they both embark on an adventure to help Ralph get a medal which Vanellope had otherwise given away as a prize in her own game Sugar Rush. There are many fun characters like Fix-It Felix, Calhoun and King Candy. There is even a cameo appearance of Sonic, which is like a dream come true for a huge Sonic fan like me. The story is great for children, the visuals are phenomenal like all Disney animated movies, the voice actors are decent, the comic timing is hilarious and unexpected (the Oreo march, Felix fixing the prison bars while trying to hammer them, Ralph running around in Calhoun's game etc). I'm pretty sure if I was a kid and I had watched it, I'd have been completely blown away by it and it would have become my favourite movie. I watched it when I was 19, and yet I really enjoyed it (the rating is from that time so I have written this review from that perspective). For the veteran gamers there are a lot of hidden jokes, easter eggs and references scattered around everywhere. I really want this franchise to expand even more. Ralph has come as a playable character in Sonic and SEGA All Star Racing Transformed. I mean, this is a movie about a game character. It would really be injustice if we don't get Sugar Rush in real life, or Fix-It Felix for mobile phones. The movie was pretty good, since it established all the ideas not even the sequel could ruin.

Maybe the little game characters who have their tower destroyed over and over again by Ralph don't like him, but, their game can't continue if he's not there to play the bad guy. I can't help but think of this film when people talk about bots on social media. Listen, just because you've had a 10+ year affair with a computer app under the same avatar doesn't make you able to navigate information better, it means you're having an emotional affair with your phone, and now you're blaming the bots for tampering with something you thought was real and it is all fiction. You are yelling into a bot about bots yelling into you, and it is all very funny to me when people choose these virtual interactions. So, invite Ralph to your Disney parties, but don't censor Ralph or any destroyer, it will only be Game Over. From what I can see, everyone wants Fix it Felix to come, but, they aren't giving any attention to lonely hero sitting in the junk yard who keeps their fun wheel spinning, and I like that this film points at him and goes; He's a hero too, y'know...",Wreck-It Ralph,Wreck-It Ralph - Movie Reviews

8955,Zdravko H,"Jan 30, 2021",The movie was not funy. It had nothing to do with the previous 2 where even though the storyline was very much the same the spirit of it was kept well. This movie is not even about a hangover. One of the most intersting characters Chang used to be this goofy weird criminal which i loved aboout him. This movie portrays him way too seriously and theres nothing funny about that. Its not even about a hangover which makes no sense since the movie is called Hangover.. I didnt even finish watching it because it was simply boring. I actually had a better idea as i was watching. What if the boys couldnt find Chang and he didnt trust them enough to meet so they thought theyd repeat the same they did the last 2 movies. Which was an actual hangover just so they can reconnect with him. And then they would forget what happend. And the plot goes on.

8964,Divyam S,"Apr 26, 2020","Today I am going to review The Hangover Trilogy. I am reviewing all the three films together because the series has now become quite old and I think no one would read full page reviews of each movie. But, if you request I would write a detailed review for each movie too. The series revolves around 4 friends, Philip(Bradley Cooper), Stu(Ed Helms), Alan ( Zach Galifianakis) and Doug ( Justin Bartha) and one more interesting, a recurring character, Chow (Ken Jeong), who is an international criminal but besides that, he is very funky. The third and final part of the trilogy revolves around Alan, who after the untimely demise of his father decides to change his ways and start living with some new standards to renovate his life. But all things don't go as planned and the four again land into trouble when Chow's enemies abduct Doug. This film too is very entertaining but what I found is that it lost its very own essence of the hangover. In the film, you see only Chow enjoying the hangover, while the four are always in trouble. The film is very humourous and good comedy too but still I would highly recommend the previous parts over this especially the first one. But still, I would give this film a positive rating.",The Hangover,The Hangover Part III - Movie Reviews

This movie has some of the laziest writing I have ever seen in film history. All of the gags fall flat and the story is stupid. Not to mention a severely horrible misuse of the song ""Hurt"". The movie begins with some drunken bastard recklessly driving a car with a giraffe in the back and accidentally causes the giraffe to get decapitated by a highway sign. Oh, and the giraffe's blood from its head splattered on a family's car with two young children inside the car which made them freak out. Did the writers and director seriously think that was funny? I did not even laugh one bit during this stupid, horrible, unfunny, lazily written movie. The acting in this movie is so horrible that it's not even one bit amusing. This movie was so painful to watch. Easily one of the worst comedies of all time. This movie isn't even remotely entertaining.

The movie starts without a proper build-up, and the story is a jumbled mess of siblings randomly forcing their own story progression. Not until the movie has nearly ended does it come together and did I feel somewhat entertained. The jokes aren't clever enough to keep your attention, except for maybe 2, and the songs feel unnecessary. The one that claims it'll get stuck in your head was ironically not that catchy, while those performed by the villain were the most fun. The previous movie's ""Everything is Awesome"" is painfully overused in the form of renditions and quotes. I think the sad version should've been the only reference, and the record album Emmet was gifted an Easter egg. The twist was a lazy attempt at making the villains misunderstood, it didn't add up, but the worst offender was the Rex character. I must've missed some dialogue, because I have no idea why he's so Hell-bent on making Emmet become like him and thus ensuring his own suffering.

All of the favorite characters from the first are great in this as well. The first one had that song we all know now, but it was not that annoying to me. This one, however, was very annoying. Way overdone which you could argue that they were purposely trying to do that. Still, it came off in a bad way to me. Still, a good watch and the visuals alone are enough to keep you intrigued.

That being said, it ends on a strong note and the characters, animation, musical numbers (I've still got one of the songs stuck in my head, I'm sure you'll know which one once you've seen it) and voice-acting are still top-notch.

The same innocence from the 2007 film was brought back which was missing from the previous installments that were convoluted mess.

9026,Thompson R,"Nov 04, 2021",Horribly directed movie that didn't coincide with the original storyline of the original Bumblebee character. Poor representation of the autobot character; which was shown being constantly thrown around and beat up the entire movie by known less powerful transformer characters.

Right from the start it looks better than all of the other movies as the Transformers actually look like THE TRANSFORMERS. The ‘80's nostalgia was a nice touch too and makes sense since the 90's is when Transformers were introduced to the masses. It's likely the most entertaining and fun of the Transformers films, and probably the best of them but it raises a big question... why didn't they just start with this? Nevertheless, it actually made me interested in seeing another Transformers movie if this is how they are going to be.",Bumblebee,Bumblebee - Movie Reviews

The Transformers actually look like the G1 incarnations, there are no stupid crude jokes, and the humans are not unlikeable morons. Yay!! (Well only one or two characters act stupid, but that’s it) Travis Knight brings a story with tons of heart that G1 fans will love! You can tell this director respects the TF mythology more than Bay ever did. Doesn’t quite fit the movie continuity and I think this is a reboot, but given the beyond-dismal ratings of the previous four sequels....it is a Good thing! I like the story of Bumblebee and Carly (Hailee Steinfield) becoming best friends, Bee trying to find his memories, and Carly trying to find herself (she was struggling ever since her father died) the ending is sad but hopeful.",SHOW MORE,Bumblebee,Bumblebee - Movie Reviews

9033,Puroo R,"Aug 22, 2021","Suppose you have to make a movie on Barbie. So, what do we know about her? She's beautiful, she's the symbol of feminine, she goes on adventures. Now suppose if these characteristics were taken and Barbie was turned into a porn film series, how would it feel? Wrong, right? Toys are supposed to be the emotions of children. So they have to be given characteristics and emotions, and not just mash them together and throw in a joke after every two lines. This is exactly the problem with the Transformers franchise, and that's what this movie has fixed. One really good thing about this movie is that unlike many character-driven movies like Sonic the Hedgehog or Cars, Bumblebee has not only ben about his relationship with other people. It is a major plot point, yes, but other than that there's also Cybertron, where the Autobots are fighting a lost cause. So this gives a sense of time constraint to the movie. If it wastes too much time the Decepticons will come on Earth and attack the humans. There are occasional warnings like that guy's pickup truck being smashed. Because of this the humans have been properly intertwined with the consequences. While Bumblebee is spending time with Charlie, he also has to learn the ways in which he must behave if he needs the humans to trust him. Charlie knows about the Cybertron attack but she can't let Bumblebee run in the open otherwise the military will take him away. The military thinks that Bumblebee is a bad guy because the Decepticons told them. There is also Charlie's friend Memo who helps her in the adventure. Overall everyone has an important part to play in this movie. And this is how it should be since the humans are in the movies for the majority of the runtime so they shouldn't be cringy to watch. The only thing this movie was lacking was Michael Bay's action scenes. I'd have preferred if they allowed Bay to stay for the fight scenes, but let Travis Knight do the rest. The action scenes and their choreography were given a nod every time Cybertron was shown. In fact, the movie begins on Cybertron itself. The fight between Bumblebee and Shatter and Dropkick clearly made it seem like how Bumblebee is struggling to keep up with them as the military is also intervening their fight. The character development of not just Bumblebee, but Charlie is also seen in the movie. In all the previous five Transformers movies, there was little to no character development, which is what made us stop caring about them. We already knew Optimus Prime will always be the good guy who will fight everyone and win (remember the Martha scene from the Last Knight where Bumblebee suddenly starts speaking and Optimus suddenly becomes a good guy?) and Megatron will be the generic bad guy. Here we have Bumblebee trying to cope with his new life, Charlie trying to get over her fear, Memo trying to impress her and Agent Burns who learns to trust the aliens. We just need a few more movies like Bumblebee and the Transformers franchise will come back on track. We have seen the character development of one Autobot, now Optimus Prime should be the next one and then possibly Megatron to give his point of view. Finally we have gone over Sam Witwicky and Cade, who had the most one dimensional personalities. Now it's all about Charlie.",Bumblebee,Bumblebee - Movie Reviews

It's surprisingly well developed and you can really tell they care for each other and having Bumblebee not being able to speak makes it a lot better honeslty as the film relies on visuals to show the friendship and it's really sweet and Hailee Steinfield delivers an excellent and heartfelt performance. Charlie alone is a sweet character and they do a pretty good job of showing her grief after her father's death. Her interactions with Memo are also sweet and it's nice they didn't actually become a couple at the end. The action itself is incredibly exciting and the CGI effects are pretty great overall. Script is a bit weak in areas. Tina and her boyfriend are just forgotten in the movie despite their impact on Charlie's character and the decepticond also disappear for periods.

9048,Mitchell C,"May 29, 2021","Bumblebee is a masterpiece of a movie, taking everything that the Michael Bay Transformers movies were known for and tossing them out the window. This movie in the franchise doesn't focus on action that much, aside from the opening scene and the last 20 minutes. But since there's not that much action, we get to focus on the main characters great personality's. Charlie works as a protagonist because we get to see her basically being bullied by her parents because she can't get over the passing of her father, as well as her relatability factor. That is until Bumblebee shows up and makes the whole experience even better. Bumblebee is the most wholesome character in this movie, he's just so innocent and curios through out the movie, he's just adorable. Shatter and Dropkick to work well as the main antagonist's of the film. Having them trying to track down Bumblebee and all. Dropkick is actually pretty funny and cocky, while Shatter is there to balance out his attitude with a more serious personality. The supporting characters do their part in Charlies journey, with the bullies picking on her, John Cena helping the Decepticons hunt down Bee. Memo helps Charlie throughout the movie too, while also acting as the human comic relief. Bumblebee is a masterpiece of a film, and i highly recommend it to anyone, wether you're a teen who can relate to Charlie, parents who may relate to Charlie's parents, someone who's into action movies, and most importantly, a transformers fan like me.",Bumblebee,Bumblebee - Movie Reviews

This movie, for the most part, achieves what it sets out to do. It's a bums-on-seats popcorn flick with just enough plot, action setpieces and to maintain interest and the characters, although extremely generic, are just the sorts that belong here.

The surprise villain(s) are not necessary to have thrown in, and the whole ""enemy of my enemy is my friend"" mentality at the end is the same for every other versus movie that we've seen in the past.

9101,Clint H,"Oct 16, 2021","Ok, it seems off to complain about the physics/science/logic of a movie that is pretty much an upgrade of a man in a rubber suit movie mixed with a comic book type plot/heroes, but I am going to anyway, and here is why.... If you are going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a film to have brilliant cg, a decent cast of actors, a neverending marketing budget, and the coming together of two huge IPs all to make what is not a deep thinking movie, but just pure summer entertainment spectacle, than would it really hurt to spend just a tiny bit more on a script, and shot boarding that can save physics from being completely lost for the duration of the film. I love spectacle movies like this, and I don't care that they are bashed for being 'low-brow', or 'ruining the film industry(along with super hero movies, etc), but when I sit down to watch what should be a total suspension of disbelief, I mean you have me at go, I'm ready to not care that from the start we have two creatures that literally could not exist without pretty much magic, all that I can just put aside, and get into this movie. And then one moment after another of seeing something like kong literally jump from one barge ship onto a destroyer and then onto an aircraft carrier. If you were to have about an equal example, imagine someone puts there toy electric speed boat, about 5 feet away from the dock and then have another model about 2 feet long another 5 feet away, now imagine leaping off that dock and using that middle toy electric boat as a stepping stone to the next. What is going to happen? Everyone knows, everyone knows what is going to happen if you do that, your foot will go right through that boat, and your head will be underwater in seconds. There won't be any graceful leap across the gap landing perfectly on the second, which even bigger would also just split in multiple pieces and sink instantly if anyone were to try to use it to hold up their weight in an ocean. I don't mind questions pseudo science that anyone with a decent amount of physics will for a second cringe in regards, but when the physics is so bloody bad that it literally pulls you immediately out of the movie going(W...T...[]) Then they have honestly screwed up. Because from the fx guys, to the directory, all the way back the writer(who I should just say might never have put something like that in the script and was just added by a producer who thinks that 'we need more explosions and crazy stuff', and thinks that it is his job to contribute to the movie with ideas that his 3 year old son gave him, et. Litearlly some of the craziest thing I have seen be added into a movie was all at the demands of producers who literally have no concept of reality, but have managed to get into the position where they are the money's representation on so then they basically get what they want, to the chagrine of the entire crew, most of all the director and writer. Anyway, but somewhere someone put ideas like that on paper, and someone literally should have said 'we can do better for a move that makes 9 figures to make', we can at least get basic, the most basics of physics. Like the earth is round, and water doesn't flow up unless magic is involved, or my favorite people will not tumble into space if they jump up higher enough and the earth's spin makes them get throw out into space like a peanut on a spinning basketball. Basic physics, like you can't get such basics things down, ie like travelling uphill takes more energy then traveling downhill, and the King of the apes that likely weighs more then the Golden Gate Bridge, cannot walk on water, heck normal gorillas cannot walk on water... Please please don't ruin such amazing IPs with such garbage scenes that can't even hold up to the scrutiny of a 3 year old...",Godzilla vs. Kong,Godzilla vs. Kong - Movie Reviews

They are believable as those characters. They are the reason I loved the 2009 Star Trek reboot so much. But I can not buy Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan.

I saw it a solid year after release, having heard many mixed things about it, in chunks. Specifically, I recall having to stop watching after the first hour, and at that point I had nothing but positives to say about it. By the time the movie ended, however, I had only contempt for it. Once in a while a movie will choose to sacrifice all goodwill it receives, but this movie pushed at this harder than I have ever witnessed via three things taking place all in a short amount of time. First it performs insanely obtuse plot gymnastics to end up to a particular dramatic moment - Then it milks it out as long and aggressively as possible - And then it pulls a: ""Oh, hey - nevermind"" twist. And this twist is via a brutally cheap Cheat that makes no sense whatsoever, and would have massive consequences far beyond what are implied in the film itself (like, imagine if a time traveler gave gunpowder to the Roman Empire and then the story said ""Otherwise, History was completely the same"" when you know that this is impossible. In the end I felt cheated by this film, and the ways that it cheats are the type that even children would likely find cheap as well. It's not the worst, but not at all recommended beyond the audio and visual spectacle. It certainly looks and sounds great, not just in terms of post-production but the lighting and cinematography are solid as well, even if it was of the semi-monochromatic blockbusters, made shortly before that fad (fortunately) died.",Star Trek Into Darkness,Star Trek Into Darkness - Movie Reviews

9157,Michael M,"Oct 18, 2021","Gladiator is the epic story of a general who is enslaved and forced to fight in the Coliseum in a low fantasy world loosely based on the Roman Empire. Jokes about the complete lack of historical accuracy aside, Gladiator has some strong points - Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) makes for a decent villain, the camerawork is strong, and the action, while occasionally spoiled by the dated slow-motion effects, is satisfying. Unfortunately, the screenplay is entirely unbefitting a Best Picture winner. It is full of pseudo-profundities and is unnecessarily depressing, fridging the main character's family almost immediately in the most horrific way possible. Worse, the awful events Maximus experiences provoke little character development beyond making him a bit bitter. He is not the only one with vague characterization: the screenplay provides little in the way of coherent character motivations for the actors (save perhaps Phoenix) to work with, and perhaps consequently, almost every line is delivered like a speech or soliloquy even when this is inappropriate for the context. Gladiator is an alright film if you want to turn your brain off and enjoy the sights, but critics often present the film as intellectually-engaging art, a modern Spartacus, which it most definitely is not.",Gladiator,Gladiator - Movie Reviews

9165,Christian K,"Aug 19, 2021","Looking back, it's been a pretty violent week in terms of film watching for me. I hadn't seen Gladiator for seventeen years, and I've wondered for a long time whether I would hold it in the same high regard I did as a fourteen year old. Especially as the last Ridley Scott film I saw was another of his historical epics, the directors cut of Kingdom Of Heaven (2005), which was boring bordering on insulting. Orlando Bloom sank the film like one of the many boulders falling to the ground in the films' action sequences, which served as a far too infrequent alarm clock for me throughout its seeming three day run time. Gladiator, thankfully, is every bit as impressive the second time round. Ridley Scott has always been a fabulous world builder, (that includes Kingdom Of Heaven) and his vision of Rome is staggering. Russell Crowe can be a figure of ridicule at times, but is on mellowed, low key, Oscar winning form here, and he is terrific. It's not often that a film with so many action fight sequences can hold you on the edge of your seat for all of them, but Gladiator achieves this in spades, and is genuinely thrilling. Joaquin Phoenix is pitifully creepy and superbly effective as the villainous Commodus, and Connie Nielsen provides excellent support, alongside the late Richard Harris in a small role. Apart from perhaps The Martian (2015), it's a long time since Scott has been on top form, and Gladiator reminds you of how good he can be.",Gladiator,Gladiator - Movie Reviews

The movie is pretty cheesy at times and I don't think the story is the best, but it's still a sweet sentiment with enough fun that makes it worth watching. If you're a hardcore rom-com fan, I doubt you haven't seen this movie yet, but if not, this is definitely a good choice for you.

9224,Catherine S,"Oct 23, 2019","The romantic comedy genre has often drifted into dark territory what with the brilliance of The Apartment (1960) and A Touch of Class (1973) but this 1990 mega hit attempts to dress up the shallow materialism and prostitution it deals with as though a woman being bought really is a fairytale. Many will argue that the film gets by on the charm of the two leads, a very young Julia Roberts and supposed ‘silver fox' Richard Gere, but I found their performances rather dull and never particularly engaging. When compared to the superlative When Harry Met Sally… (1989) it becomes clear just how lacking this film is in both romance and comedy and even Marshall's trashterpiece Beaches (1988) shows up all of the flaws of this movie as it lacks even the campy charm of that Bette Midler classic. Prostitute Vivian Ward, Julia Roberts, helps corporate raider Edward Lewis, Richard Gere, drive his manual car from Hollywood Boulevard to his upmarket hotel and he agrees to employ her services for one week. She is paid $3000 and he gives her money to purchase an expensive new wardrobe so that she will be able to impress his clients. The two begin to fall in love much to her chagrin and she softens him as he struggles to dismantle the company of a man who wants to continue operating it. With her new outfits and relationship with Lewis Ward begins to gain confidence and is able to charm Lewis's associates with her straightforward style of speaking and beauty. They face challenges when Lewis is forced to reveal to others that Ward is a prostitute and they begin to question the nature of their relationship. After Ward departs for fear of simply being an object to Lewis she is won back by him as he performs a routine in which he imitates one of the ‘knights in shining armor' she had imagined as a child. This is one of those films that pretends to be about how money is not worth as much as genuine love and affection but negates that idea constantly with how obsessed the characters are with status symbols and the creepy nature of the relationship. Ward is essentially bought by her love interest and their connection seems to be based on the fact that she is physically attractive and he can buy her pretty clothing. Even when we are meant to believe that they are ‘really' falling for one another we hear Ward ask Lewis how much the necklace he bought her costs and while her leaving the money he offers her on the bed is meant to be symbolic she is still departing with expensive clothing and the $300 he paid for her services. A film that portrays the power imbalance in this sort of relationship for what it actually is can be found in Klute (1971) which explores the psychological impact that actually falling in love with a man can have on a prostitute. While this clearly does not aspire to be as gritty or honest as Klute it would have been nice to see this film be less disgusting in the way that it equates a man owning a woman as him loving her. There is also hypocrisy in the film's message about big business as we are meant to believe that Lewis is ‘cruel' in dismantling an old man's business but this is what he does for a job and if he were not doing this he would not have the money to pay for Ward's clothing and ‘services'. This is what makes it so objectionable when she urges him not to go ahead with his plans. We are meant to believe that this woman, who is surely familiar with using people for money, is so innocent that she believes Lewis can go on losing money because a few businessman won't let their businesses go. We are also meant to believe that she is ‘helping' him by encouraging him to make these decisions and her final line ""She rescued him right back"" is supposed to ensure us that she can hold control over their relationship. This is not true as if they are to remain together, living the way they do, he will have to continue his corporate raiding and she will have to turn a blind eye so that she can continue going to the opera. The lead performances are where the film really lost me as usually even the most average screenplay, this one is quite awful, can be lifted by two charismatic leads a la Falling in Love (1984). Roberts is meant to be so darn cute and charming but is never convincing either as the country bumpkin with the knowledge of cars or the sophisticate who loves opera. She seems too highly strung and calculating, qualities used well in My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), to be the guileless little hooker we are meant to fall for in this film. Gere on the other hand doesn't register at all as he is a bland, uninspiring romantic lead with none of the manic intensity he brought to Unfaithful (2002) or Arbitrage (2016). The two together lack chemistry and you never feel as though they are anything more than friends even when naked in a bathtub together. This is definitely one to miss as there are many wonderful romantic comedies out there, even ones concerning prostitutes, that are funnier and more romantic than this one.",Pretty Woman,Pretty Woman - Movie Reviews

9237,Marco Antonio B,"Oct 06, 2021","Cars is an animation movie, made by Disney Pixar in 2006, in the cast there's names such as Owen Wilson as Lightning MacQueen and Paul Newman as Doc Hudson. The movie is about a selfish race car who gets lost in a small town called ""Radiator Springs"". There he meets Mater, a winch car who will become his best friend by the end of the movie. It's completely awesome and surprising to see the evolution of Lightning MacQueen along the movie. The people (or the cars) he met there changes him to a very kind and generous person (or car), and you can literally feel the connection and the friendship they made there. Also, a great aspect of the movie is the quality of it. For a movie made in 2006 it is just incredible. As far as I'm concerned they used a technology called ray tracing. Its function is to calculate the trajectory of the light based on shadows and light points. And believe me, it does its job. The movie is just impeccable!

9245,Christian K,"Aug 19, 2021","Cars gets a pretty bad press, as far as I can gather it seems to suffer from being the first Pixar vehicle (whay) that dipped below excellent. Cars, following the story of racer Lightning McQueen on his road to redemption after getting lost in the wilderness, is far too long at an almost inexplicable 2 hours, and it really meanders in the middle section. It's baffling considering the subject matter would obviously appeal to an even younger audience than normal. But, the first half an hour is up there with the best and most exciting segments in Pixars' back catalogue, the opening race sequence and surrounding inventiveness are superb, and there are laughs a plenty. It's certainly in a different league to Cars 3 (2017) which is very dull, but in perhaps being overconfident in it's length, Cars falls short of Pixar's previous outings.",Cars,Cars - Movie Reviews

9254,Jacob R,"Jun 23, 2021","Ok…why do people hate this movie again? This movie is fine, really good at some points even, but people act like this is the worse Pixar movie ever made, and it just isn't. Not even close to it. One, the voice acting is really good in this movie, especially Owen Wilson and weirdly Larry the Cable Guy. Secondly, the animation, like in almost every Pixar movie, is great. All the racing scenes are fast and smooth, which you need for this kind of movie. Wow, I'm praising this movie, but it still has major problems! For example, there isn't really a huge emotional moment in this movie, and unlike the incredibles, you can't get away with that here. But the biggest thing is the concept and the plot. It's a fish out of water story about a big city kid going into a small town and learning humility. We've seen that a bunch of times, and this doesn't change the formula up at all, except for them being cars. Speaking of which, there is no reason why the characters should be cars, like I can't give you a good reason for it. With all of that said….I like this movie. Is it a top 10 Pixar movie? No, far from it actually. But is it the animated movie that everyone thinks is the worse Pixar movie ever? No, again far from it. There were 3 Pixar movies in the 2010s alone that I hated more than this, and I could argue that they made a Pixar movie worse than this even before Cars was made. Ever heard of that boring movie called A Bugs Life? Yeah, I'm not bored by Cars unlike that movie. So….do you agree or disagree with me on this? Go to Disney+ and see it for yourself!",Cars,Cars - Movie Reviews

9256,Jerry S,"Jun 17, 2021","Cars was the one franchise that really got me into Pixar. I honestly didn't know much about Pixar until I saw this movie, I used to love this movie as a kid, and I probably would've gave it a 10/10 if you were to ask me. However that was back then. Now that I am older now what do I think of the movie now? Actually the movie is still pretty good. Not one of Pixar's best but at the very least it's still is good. One of the highlights of this movie is actually the message that it teaches. In this one a hot shot rookie named Lightning McQueen gets in and over his head about winning the Piston Cup. However after his three way tie between Chick Hits and The King he's in a hurry to get to his last chance of winning the Piston Cup he has to get to California in time before the big race, however all of his plans change and then he ends up in a small town called Radiator Springs. This is actually we're the movie shines the best. The movie's entire message is about taking a break from you normal routine and just enjoy life for once. Yes you can get back to your normally but it is also important to take it easy and just look at life around you. Honestly I like the message that the film was trying to teach but by far the best thing about this movie is the relationship between Lightning McQueen and Doc Hudson. Their relationship is actually the most heartwarming of the movie. However the movie is not perfect though in fact it's far from it while it is actually a nice message to have for kids the movie does feel a bit too long and it can feel like some thing could be cut out however even with that though it still make sense because of the film's message of enjoying life and the people or in this case cars around you also there are some scenes that do kinda feel like it's filler and the animation, while good, it can get boring to look at considering the fact that they are cars and they don't have a lot of range to make it entertaining. All in all Cars was a pretty good movie. With a good message, and likable characters, it might not be a fun ride but it is a smooth one. 7.8/10",Cars,Cars - Movie Reviews

First of all in a cinematographic standpoint, this was a masterpiece. Second of all, how can people dare to say this is propaganda, when there are actual historic footages from that time still in historic archives depicting that event, recorded by journalists. And the movie didn't even portrayed the chinese soldiers having a victory, but it was a bloody retreat, as was described in history that is even recorded and known in western history books. And the soldiers weren't even communists, they were from NRA from Chiang Kaisheks army. Also the West, as in The League of Nations didn't lay a finger to help the chinese to fight fascism. It's a shame and disgrace of western cinemas not putting this movie in mainstream theaters and telling the story about the brave sacrifice these chinese soldiers have made in trying to defend their dignity and country.",The Eight Hundred,The Eight Hundred - Movie Reviews

9294,Daniel L,"Sep 08, 2020","I was born in Taiwan (Republic of China) and I was very surprised to see a movie made in mainland China that depicts the flag and sung the national anthem of the Republic of China. My own grandparents weren't those veteran soldiers who retreated to Taiwan with Chang Kei Shek but the story of the 800 still resonated with me. I think it is very nice to see a world war 2 movie that is not western centric, because after all it was a world war and so throughout the entire world there were many unsung heroes who gave their lives to defend their own countries from foreign invasion. THe production value of this movie was top notch and it was on par with big Hollywood war movies like Dunkirk and 1917. However I thought the actors over-acted a little and the performance didn't feel ""natural"". The actions in the movie were superb but the pacing of the storytelling felt a bit odd at places. So while I think the production value, the visuals and the action scenes were excellent but the acting and the storytelling were a little weak. There are also numerous Chinese cultural references and most western audience will not be able to appreciate the significance unless they are versed in classics of the Chinese literature. For example, the white horse and the medieval warrior riding the white horse in the ""dream sequence"" was a reference to a character (and a historical figure) from the historical fiction novel The Romance of Three Kingdoms. Since this movie is an international release so perhaps the director should have included a footnote in the movie or something to help the western audience understand it. Anyway, The Eight Hundred is a pretty good war movie, and I am glad to have seen it.",The Eight Hundred,The Eight Hundred - Movie Reviews

9309,Juliano R,"Sep 17, 2021","Oof, let's remember that every film has positives and negative's. The fact that Fox retconned so many decisions made in this film alone let's you know they screwed the pooch on this film. The bad, a story like Dark Phoenix needs every detail from the source material to make it right, Simon Kinberg clearly thought otherwise (so much so that he basically did the same story adaption for the latest Dark Phoenix attempt, ugh!). While going the ""easier"" route by making the Phoenix a dual personality within Jean Grey would hold more general audiences attention then going full out space bound like in the comics; this diversion from said source material handicaps the film, leaving true X-Men fans with a sour taste in their mouth. The good, I always believe that if you're struggling to find something redeemable in a bad movie, always consider the score! The music composition in Last Stand will give you chills thanks to John Powell's amazing foresight into a scenes emotional state. Despite the horrible decision to kill off Professor X & Cyclops in the first act of the film, both moments are heightened to a 10 thanks to Powell (I get frisson every. time Dark Phoenix takes full control of Jean)! The acting throughout is exceptionally well with the main cast despite cringe worthy one liners and the mass injustice done to Rogues character and Anna Paquins acting ability. Famke Jansen and Hugh's chemistry in the film alone makes this an easier pill to swallow and really sales the final confrontation! Overall, a Dark Phoenix storyline done right will need heavy development, and it'll probably be a good while before another attempt at this iconic storyline. Although, now that X-Men is in the hands of Kevin Feige I have no doubt the next time we have to take this journey with Jean and the X-Men it will be a glory to behold.",X-Men: The Last Stand,X-Men: The Last Stand - Movie Reviews

9316,Noah B,"Jul 23, 2021","The action was the best of the trilogy, but the plot was terrible. It appears that the producers cut crucial scenes from the film, showing how characters individually decided which side they were on. It was almost like people chose sides solely based on whether they were allies of Xavier or allies of Magneto. The story started out with members of the X-Men, like Dr. Hank McCoy vehemently denouncing the cure. Hank was so opposed to it that he resigned from his position on the cabinet. However, later on, the X-Men ended up defending the cure, almost as if the only reason they cared was that they needed to be against anything Magneto wanted. The resolution to the film was equally disappointing. Did societies efforts to develop a cure just magically stop? Also, if the film already demonstrated that Dr. Hank McCoy's position on the cabinet meant nothing when it came to policy, why would his being appointed to the UN mean anything either? Most egregiously, because the movie removed any ethical depth, it argued that anything more than waving a sign in disagreement with something was wrong. Most mutants regarded the cure like someone would regard trying to ""cure"" someone who's gay. Instead of the movie arguing that mutants should fight for their rights, while still trying to respect non-mutant's rights, the movie advocated for mutants to be push-overs, hoping that non-mutants would magically become enlightened. More broadly, since most viewers have drawn parallels between mutants and other marginalized groups, the message of the movie is that marginalized groups in the real world should just let their oppressors step all over them.",X-Men: The Last Stand,X-Men: The Last Stand - Movie Reviews

9324,Ryan S,"May 20, 2021","I'm surprised to see a big drop in average rating for this. I enjoyed <em>'X-Men: The Last Stand'</em> to be honest. Taking a quick look at some other reviews and it seems to main gripe is how it treats certain characters from the comics, which is fair enough for sure but that doesn't come into play for me as I'm not a comic reader. I can only judge it as a film and as one I found it suitably entertaining. Hugh Jackman remains the top dog, though at the beginning the way Wolverine acts felt off to me - though that quickly went away. I would've liked if they found a spot for Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), though one of his replacements in Beast (Kelsey Grammer) went down well with me. From what I read I can understand other people's complaints with this, especially with the aforementioned iffy character treatment, but I gotta be honest and say that I found it to be a good enough watch - even if it is comparatively the weakest entry of the original trilogy. /copied directly from my Letterboxd review\",X-Men: The Last Stand,X-Men: The Last Stand - Movie Reviews

The effects and action were good for its era, but it was waay too short and it felt so very rushed. Why?! This had always boggled my mind. In order to do justice to the Phoenix Saga you really need at the very least, one trilogy to tell the tale. Instead, not only did they do a Phoenix movie in a lottle over 90 minutes, but that in addition, they actually attempted to cram another story about mutants and the political/philosophical debate about accepting one's self of who you are or take a ""cure"" for it and remove it permanently to fit in, be normal and protect those around you ftom an unexpected mutant power going off and hurting an innocent person in that process. These two things should definetly be two seperate films. Big mistake. Over-all a disappointment with average dialogue and a very cool and good 2nd chapter in Jean Gray's home.

Magneto gets a huge wow moment when he lifts the entire Golden Gate Bridge and Famke Jannssen's Dark Phonenix while a little too 'The Exorcist' is believable and well done. If you put the nitpicking aside there is an enjoyable ride to be had. If you still think the movie is bad, go watch Simon Kinberg's Dark Phoenix (2019) and I'm sure you'll change your mind.

9328,Puroo R,"Apr 11, 2021","X-Men: The Last Stand was the first X-Men movie I had ever watched. The house fight scene where Wolverine, Storm and Xavier get beaten was the first scene I saw of an X-Men movie. So you can understand how heavy of an impact this movie left on me. My hero, my man, all 3 of them, getting beaten to pulp. But I thought probably that's just one scene and they may get their comeuppance later. And so I stopped watching this movie. I watched it many years later when I began watching every movie from this franchise. So this movie suffers from something I like to call ""replacement disruption"". It means when someone replaces the director of the movie and then the director makes the movie as if he has never seen the franchise before. Like Joss Whedon for Justice League, Chris Miller in Shrek the Third, Richard Lester for Superman III, Joel Schumacher for Batman Forever etc. This movie throws away all the concepts established previously. Wolverine no longer cares about Rogue, Scott dies as soon as the movie begins, Xavier is killed off, Magneto discards Mystique once she's of no use to him and Wolverine KILLS Phoenix! I really hate what this movie did to my favourite heroes, but I like the fact that this movie has some really good CGI. It shows the concept of mutants being shamed into thinking that they are bad because of their superpowers, and that they should give them up and live like humans. This was actually a really interesting storyline, and it should have been the one which should have been given more emphasis instead of whatever Jean was doing. Warren Worthington III was also a very interesting character and should have been given more screen time. The visual appeal, the score and the acting are all perfect, but the terrible storyline and lack of understanding the concept is what ruins it. Batman v Superman also had the same problem, but at least that was supposed to be the tone of the franchise. Here the tone of the franchise was very different, and this movie is the one which completely changed it and made X-Men the diverse franchise which it is. It is the reason why we got Deadpool and Logan, so I guess that's one good thing that came out of this movie.",X-Men: The Last Stand,X-Men: The Last Stand - Movie Reviews

The action is super well-handled especially the final battle, Storm and Wolverine gets some cool moments and UNPOPULAR OPINION, I kind of like how Xavier died and the movie did a good job exploring the impact of his death. The Phoenix Storyline also had good potential. On the other hand, there are so many characters in this movie that serve no purpose to the plot like Angel despite some nice scenes, it feels convoluted and lacks a singular storyline, the Phoenix storyline felt forced, the ending felt rushed and it lacks the style of the first 2 movies and what they did to Cyclops was unacceptable (although X-2 also treated him poorly).

A little at least.,X-Men: The Last Stand,X-Men: The Last Stand - Movie Reviews

9345,Dale R,"Nov 14, 2021","Nicolas Cage returns in this sequel to find another treasure to prove that one of his ancestors was not a traitor to the United States. The first movie was a bit of a giant pill to swallow, this one is bigger and more fantastical. This time around the clues revolve around Civil War history instead of the founding of the country. The ending of this film is a bit confusing as the villain's motivations and fate seemed to change suddenly. Some so-so set pieces near the end, good acting from the cast and a script that isn't as imaginative as the first movie. If you enjoyed the original then this one might be worth a watch.",National Treasure: Book of Secrets,National Treasure: Book of Secrets - Movie Reviews

9347,Peter W,"May 17, 2021","Had to stop watching , as it was embarrassing. From the very first technical fumble: discussing Playfair codes, which was wrong on so many levels, it simply got worse. Nicholas Cage is a person whose acting I've never had any sympathy for, and yet another misfire trashes any credibility he may have possibly been trying to garner. I don't understand how a dog eat dog industry like Hollywood continues to underwrite mediocrity to this extent",National Treasure: Book of Secrets,National Treasure: Book of Secrets - Movie Reviews
9348,Rick V,"Apr 01, 2021","This is pretty much my favorite genre of movie; and this sequel nails it again. I like the first one just a tad more (perhaps because the treasure itself is cooler?) but this one is also very good and worth a watch.

It's like the Goonies for grown ups!",National Treasure: Book of Secrets,National Treasure: Book of Secrets - Movie Reviews
9349,Sophia D,"Feb 22, 2021",I like the second one just as much as the first. You can tell that the actors have gotten their characters down and they all have such a great dynamic together. The plot is sturdy and just as wild as the first movie. With the addition of Ed Harris as the big bad it really just pulls it all together. You feel like you are on a treasure hunt with all of these people. I recommend it!,National Treasure: Book of Secrets,National Treasure: Book of Secrets - Movie Reviews

And there are some scenes that I don't particularly care for like Ben arguing with a little kid about Ben's great grandad killing president Lincoln. And I kinda feel like in 2007 or whenever this movie came out if there was a story about someone other than John Wilkes Booth killing or conspiring to kill Lincoln it wouldn't be that big of a story and most people wouldn't care about it. And the story doesn't engage me as much as the first one did.

Between Cage's frenetic dialogue pace and the constant motion to different locations, you might need medication to keep up.

Yet, unlike The Hangover: Part II, this movie doesn't feel like a shot-for-shot remake despite its repetition. If anything, it has the same flaws and strengths as the first film. The plot is stupid and improbable yet the adventure and camaraderie between actors are a lot of fun and there is some education to be had but, like Indiana Jones, it's in a fun way. Is National Treasure: Book of Secrets the Hangover II of adventure sequels (bad) or the Rocky II of them (surprisingly good)?

This one is centered more around the civil war while the previous one was more about the revolutionary war. It makes a fun dynamic as it feels all knew. The villain has a purpose, and motivation along with the other characters except for maybe Riley. Still Justin Bartha does a fabulous job you will not even question why he hangs with Nicolas Cage's character as all the best comedy comes from him. Nicolas Cage along with others everyone once in awhile has a few slip ups but nothing too much to take you out of the movie. That and the fact that in some places in the story line the movie is very generic are my only complains because all together its a fun action, adventure, mystery, staring Nicolas Cage in 07 it cannot be too bad .",National Treasure: Book of Secrets,National Treasure: Book of Secrets - Movie Reviews
