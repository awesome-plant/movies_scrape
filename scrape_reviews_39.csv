0,Ben W,6h ago,The best movie of all time,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
1,Aidan B,3d ago,"It provides groundbreaking CGI and is a well-acted film, however, the extremely generic story and mediocre plot end up bogging this film down. I think Cameron does a good job in directing this film, and the idea and worldbuilding was very well, however, the execution is poor as it just feels way more generic than it should have been. The acting is well though, and the CGI is phenomenal. There were also several plot holes, though I do hold hope that the planned sequel does expand well upon this film and better explains a lot of the things that occur. Overall, an entertaining film, just not one of Cameron's best works due to its lacking story.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
2,Rob T,"Nov 11, 2021","I didn't watch this in 3D but I did watch this on a big screen (not some 65"" TV) so I admit the visuals are quality but I'm guessing the 3D adds a lot more to the visuals. The story itself is unique, though there are some occasional scratch-your-head moments. I may be in the minority but it felt a bit weird to root for the romantic inter-species relationship. Still, overall a fairly decent piece of entertainment.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
3,Jon S,"Nov 10, 2021","Spectacular 3D visuals. Everything else (plot, character, dialogue, acting, pacing) was middling to bad.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
4,Michael P,"Oct 24, 2021","Unfortunately, this movie just hasn't aged well over the years. While the visuals are stunning (Pandora's flora and fauna) where built really well, great lighting, great photography work and the human portion of the dialogue isn't bad either, I just can't get past two big things in this movie a) the dialogue of the Na'vi - I mean, that is the best they could come up with? and b) the story arc - the movie is basically a mashup of Dances w/ Wolves, FernGully, and Pocahontas. Sure it isn't a complete 1 for 1, but for someone who had a lot of time to work on the story line, this is the best James C could come up with? (Dances w/ Wolves in Outer Space?) The technological concepts are good, but the story overtime, it just gets worse everytime I watch it. I cringe when I hear the Na'vi rally cry, its just culturally...well, insensitive. In this regard, the Na'vi language isn't original...of course, its a unique language completely made up (Frommer took inspiration from the Maori language)....and I guess that is my problem here. The vocal range is human, the language is based off a human language, the pitch and frequency of the spoken language is human. It just doesn't make a lot of sense...think about it, we share 98.8% of our DNA with chimpanzees, 70% of our DNA with zebrafish, and 60% of our DNA with bananas, and we sound NOTHING ALIKE! ;-) We travel to another fictional part of the universe and the Na'vi just happen to sound like one of our Polynesian languages hear on earth? If they are in the process of are being unoriginal, they could have at least given the Na'vi a proper Haka War Cry.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
5,Shane B,"Oct 20, 2021","When you take away the CGI and 3D effects, the movie itself isn't great. Go to a planetarium, you'll save some time. Dud!",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
6,Andrew M,"Oct 08, 2021","The world of Avatar is absolutely stunning. The visuals are remarkable, The Na'vi culture is very rich and Zoe Saldana does an amazing job in this film. A lot of hard work was put into this movie and it shows.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
7,Robb D,"Sep 09, 2021","What Avatar lacks in originality, it easily makes up for with stunning visuals and some amazing action. Cameron is a genius with a camera and his mastery is on full display to anyone who can view this beautiful film in the best HD resolution possible. 9/10",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
8,Eric P,"Aug 28, 2021",Here is a film that is truly amazing! The visual effects in this were one of a kind that were special and effective. The music and the scenes in Avatar gave me emotional feelings where I almost teared up. The action sequences in this film are amazing as well. One could argue that this movie is just Dances with Wolves knock-off with a hint of science fiction but the positives outweigh the negatives. James Cameron did a very phenomenal job directing this film.,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
9,Jordan H,"Aug 24, 2021",Cookie cutter plot. Saw it for the novelty of new 3D in 2009. No need to ever watch it again.,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews

16,Robert P,"Jul 23, 2021","The most expensive film to make, and currently it holds the biggest gross returns in history, I can only say this is the ultimate sci-fi adventure you can see to date!",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
17,"Jul 18, 2021","Probably the best Disney movie I've ever seen, ahead of it's time, watched it in theaters back then with 3d glasses and it blew any 3d movie out the water",FLAG THIS REVIEW,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
18,Dean S,"Jul 17, 2021",Saw in the movies in 3D so that was fun. But the story itself was pretty cheesy. I'm glad James Cameron stopped this nonsense and is now focusing on the epic story of Alita the Battle Angel.,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
19,Joe D,"Jul 11, 2021","To me this is the most perfect blockbuster of all. Love Sam Worthington's empty cup, I find his everyman acting compelling, Saldana may be the most beautiful woman on the planet with her trademark perfect posture, and Sigourney adds class with extra to spare wherever she goes. The planet Pandora remains the real star, and the revelation that we're the bad guys and the spiritual tree-huggers were right all along, I find genuinely touching every time. First class and I can't wait for more of Cameron's magic touch.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
20,Jimmy W,"Jul 10, 2021","The fact that this movie can make the most money of all time and also gain a following of hive-minded morons to defend it says more about the state of society than it does the movie itself. For a movie that's meant to make a point about abusive use of the environment, they sure seem to indulge in the use of massive amounts of expensive technology that no doubt utilized way more than its fair share of natural resources. Oh well, at least you can pretend to be vindicated by the box office numbers.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
21,Goudkuil E,"Jun 29, 2021","Apart from the visuals everything feels uninspired and thrown together using a old cliche of an outsider seeing what's wrong with what he's people have been doing falling in love then whiching sides. The acting is ok, the dialogue is kinda rough. The movie is padded with a lot of nice scenique views with no real narrative meaning.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
22,Antonio D,"Jun 15, 2021","o filme possui uma fotografia muito bela e, mesmo o filme sendo de 2009 não conseguimos encontrar defeitos em relação a montagem e fotografia, a história é satisfatória e é um reflexo do que sabemos que aconteceu no inicio da colonização",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
23,Tyler W,"Jun 11, 2021","The visuals were revolutionary for the time. But story matters and to the extent this film had a plot, it was borrowed from FernGully and Dances with Wolves.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
24,Noah H,"Jun 08, 2021","Great film through and through. The plot is excellent and engaging, and the character development is of a very high standard. Although it is a very long film, every scene adds to the atmosphere. Definitely worth watching - you won't regret it!",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
25,Erick F,"May 28, 2021","Filme perfeito. Edição, imagens, efeitos, narrativa, roteiro, atuações, planos de sequências. Incrivelmente extraordinário, te transporta para a incrível realidade de Pandora, e faz você de lá nunca mais querer voltar. Película completamente por múltiplas razões.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
26,Nathan t,"May 28, 2021","Avatar is an American science fiction film, directed by James Cameron and released in 2009. In this film we can find many guess like Sam Worthington or Sigourney Weaver. They portray Jake Sully and Dr. Grace Augustine. The main character Jake Sully try to understand how does a new specie live in Pandora. The film is about the probably future of humanity. The humans have deleted all the ressources of the earth, so they try to visit others planets for maybe find minerals. During this film we are on Pandora, a moon of a new planet. Human species can live in the Pandora's atmosphere, but scientist found a possibility to go discover all the planet. Take control of humanoids who live in Pandora. So we follow Jake Sully and Dr. Grace Augustin who will try to make contact with Eywa the chief of this new population. When I watched this movie for the first time the plot convinced me, because it is unpredictable and highly absorbing. There are many unexpected during all the movie. I must talk to you about the special effects. This movie is, for me, the most staggering film of the last 10 years. All jungle and humanoids made with special effects, the colors and the mood are very special. Each flowers or trees are detailed. It is perfectly stunning. The photography also is breathtaking, colors enable to convince all the viewers. There different cinematography techniques which give a beautiful introduction and transitions during the movie. Actors, portrayed, a human character but also a humanoid character, they must keep the same attitude and the same mouvements when they represented creatures. Each actor is natural and it's likeable to see. To sum up, I can say that this movie must be watch by everybody. With all work to make the special effects and the script, this movie seem prefect.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
27,Jasper S,"May 27, 2021","De wereld van avatar roept bij mij vooral emoties van verwondering op. De wereld is zo wonder schoon en goed uitgewerkt. Je kan de hele film 2 keer kijken 1 keer voor de film zelf en de tweede keer voor de visuals. Het best voor deze film is om hem in de bioscoop te bekijken. Daar in die donkere bioscoop waar niks uitmaakt behalve de film worden bijna alle zintuigen geprikkeld. De dolby atmos surround sound zorgt ervoor dat jou oren alles meekrijgen wat er om jou heen gebeurt. Van het kogelschot rechts voor naar het fluitende vogeltje links achter. Het grote doek zorgt ervoor data jou hele gezicht veld word opgenomen door deze adem benemende film. Je voelt misschien niks fysiek op je huid neerkomen maar als jij kippenvel krijgt van de film merk jij dat heus. Het jammere is dat je de film niet kan ruiken of proeven wat zou dat een beleving zijn. Dan zou er bijna geen verschil meer zitten tussen film en realiteit. Deze wereld bevind zich in het universum met de aarde. De wereld zelf bevind zich echter op een andere planeet binnen dit universum. De wereld lijkt erg op de aarde met het aantal gewassen die overal staan alleen is alles een stuk groter. James Cameron is de regisseur en schrijver van de film. Dus de wereld is in zijn hoofd gemaakt. De mensen die de wereld daadwerkelijk gemaakt hebben zoals jij het in de bioscoop mag zien is gemaakt door een groep van meer dan 1000 mensen een gigantische computer server en een groot budget. Filmen begon in april 2007. Dat betekent natuurlijk niet dat deze film toen al af was want hij was pas in december 2009 te zien in de bioscopen. Avatar is een box office film gedirigeerd en geschreven door James Cameron die zich afspeelt op een andere planeet. De boodschap van avatar is dat je zuinig moet zijn op je grondstoffen. En je zuinig moet zijn op de planeet waarop je woont. De doelgroep van Avatar is iedereen die van films houd vooral van een beetje science fiction. Er zit niet perse een leeftijd grens aan de film je moet alleen wel 13 zijn om de film te kunnen zien. Het verhaal van de wereld is dat de aarde niet meer goed bewoonbaar is en de mensen van de aarde naar een andere planeet gaan om daar grondstoffen te verkrijgen om rijk te worden. De hoofdrolspeler is een man die geen functionaliteit meer heeft in zijn benen en naar de planeet komt voor onderzoek. Hij gaat zichzelf over zetten in een lichaam van de inboorlingen waarin hij ook weer kan lopen. Het conflict van het verhaal is tussen mens/machine en inboorling/natuur. De inboorlingen houden namelijk van hun wereld en behandelen de wereld met de respect dat die nodig heeft en de mensen komen alles kapot maken. De hoofdrol speler zorgt ervoor dat er een connectie gelegd word tussen mens en inboorling maar stapt uiteindelijk over naar de kant van de inboorlingen om hun te helpen mens te verslaan. De characters Bestaan uit mensen, mensen in machines, Na'vi (inboorling), en meerdere dieren. In de wereld waar de mensen komen is alles een stuk groter dus de mensen maken exoskeletons om een kans te hebben. De Na'vi aan de andere kant zijn zo in toon met de natuur dat is een vlecht hebben waarmee ze een band kunnen maken met dieren. De sferen die in het verhaal komen zijn heel wissel valig door de film heen. In het begin is het vooral leuk dat je alles kan ontdekken en sta je achter de mensen. Als de hoofdpersoon met zijn lichaam van een na'vi het kamp van de na'vi binnen komt is er vooral liefde. Daarna sta je achter de na'vi en is er vooral verdriet over de destructie van de mensen. Maar op het eind is het euforie door de overwinning van de na'vi. Een hele achtbaan aan sferen dus De film word foto realistisch vorm gegeven op een 2d doek. Ook 3d als je de bioscoop extra betaald en je een bril opdoet. Het thema van de wereld is natuur en duurzaamheid.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews

36,"Apr 27, 2021","The main film of the year 2009 is «Avatar» by James Cameron, the producer of such films as «Terminator», «Titanic», «The Strangers». This film ranks with above-mentioned world-famous films and probably belongs to the science-fiction genre. The action of the film is set on the planet Pandora in the year of 3000. The plot is rather simple: the super hero Avatar is to save the alien planet and to fulfill this mission he struggles with a lot of difficulties. The main character, Jack Sally, is a disabled navy who has just come back from the war. The film starts with the scene when he is invited to take part in a secret expedition to the planet, inhabited by weird creatures. Thus, he becomes the part of the programme called Avatar. Being turned into a a three-metre giant with blue skin, he is sent to the planet with the help of special «drivers» that link his mind to the mind of Avatar. What impressed me most is the spectacular world of aliens that we, the audience, see through the eyes of the main character. The special effects and 3D technologies enhance the impression of the bright and colourful world in contrast to the human one, which is grey and dying. The plot of the film is fast-moving with some amusing episodes. For those who are indifferent to the computer graphics, there is another storyline that is love of «the dream worker» to a beautiful female alien, who, being hostile and suspicious at first, falls in love with him. Such love is forbidden and as a result the pair is chased by the aliens. Happily, they managed to escape in the end. To my mind, the brillant acting of Sam Worthingdon, who is starring in the film, is above all expectations. To sum up, I can say that the film «Avatar» is that kind of film that takes us to a special world beyond imagination. More than that, it is the film that you want to watch over and over again. Definitely, the new film by Cameron couldn't be missed.",SHOW MORE,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews

This is one movie that Just HAD to be seen in 3D! Loved it! Great action, special effects and a powerful story. The story has similarities from both Fern Gully and Dances with Wolves. I was blown away!! James Cameron did a great Job of creating this new world of Pandora and the Navi and the Beautiful creatures of this world. The cast such as leads Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana also did a tremendous job!

It's what I expected to see, after they've invested over $ 350 million doing it. And it's definitely what I was hoping to see to dramatically close a franchise that, in my opinion, should take a break so as not to saturate the genre.

59,Alex T,"Nov 16, 2021","I've always liked Marvel comics and followed the movies somewhat as a result, never really following the MCU, but due to movies like Endgame I feel like I'm really falling out with the fanbase. My view of Endgame is its just overrated beyond belief, I think the premise is okay in the sense that it ties all the previous movies up and includes many of the characters but its bad in the way in how destructive it is, disabling any kind of meaningful progression in the franchise. I feel in this way, the deaths in this film and the one before it are hollow where they have little meaning due to them being resurrected in a spinoff or in canon. Admittedly the special effects are impressive and the sheer scope of the movie is as well but is undermined by a destructive and substance-less story in addition to the its copious runtime. I'm sorry Marvel, you've lost me on this one.",Avengers: Endgame,Avengers: Endgame - Movie Reviews
60,Aidan B,"Nov 16, 2021","A fine film that, in my eyes, feels very overrated. The comedy feels more forced, the story is just constant fan-service, and the final fight scene feels more cringe than epic due to the goofiness of some of the choices they made (ie all the Avengers running in a line). While the beginning and ending was admittedly great, and the acting is still as good as ever, ""Avengers: Endgame"" just fails to hold a light to some of the far better installments in the MCU. While I still found the film to be mostly enjoyable, I was able to find enough glaring flaws during my rewatch to bring the score down.",Avengers: Endgame,Avengers: Endgame - Movie Reviews
61,Vito N,"Nov 15, 2021","After much thought I have come to the conclusion that this is my Favorite Movie of All Time. It's 3 hours long, and it's all worth it. There's so much to talk about this film whether it's the drama between Cap and his final fight, Tony and coming to peace with his father, or Thor realizing that it's him that makes the lighting and not the lightning that makes him. The action is the best it's ever been, the CGI is world class as always, and the performances from the entire ensemble cast is as good as it'll ever be. Is it a perfect film? Heck no, but it's as close to perfect as you could ever get, and it comes pretty damn close.

This classic movie has revolutionary CGI for its time, with the classic story of star-crossed-lovers transitioned to the Titanic perfectly, this film remains one of Cameron's best works ever put on the big screen.

85,Money G,"Nov 09, 2021","CMON! I was expecting more from the characters. I grew up in America and this is a movie commonly referenced in conversation. Sadly, it is a reflection of American taste and depth more than it is a beautiful movie. James Cameron extends greater consideration towards budget, set design, a panning camera, and scope of grandeur and disaster than what I identify as the real conflict worth tears. Not one person survived with a Third Class ticket. The rich negotiate, offer leverage, hide in spacious lifeboats and Rose survives instead of Jack. This is an accurate story but should be received as a tragedy instead of a romance. What lines of memorable dialogue are there? They pass the plot along, the ship must sink. There are memorable visuals, the set is magnificent, and the scene where voices stop and are frozen is excellent. However, unlike the iceberg, there is not enough depth.",Titanic,Titanic - Movie Reviews

100,Romina R,"Aug 30, 2021","There is a trend happening more now than ever where people hate on classic films for the sake of hating because they are classic films and loved by the majority of the public. As I start this ""Re-watching and Re-visiting films"" series, I will be repeating this many times. I do not quite get people's issue and ""beef"" (to put it less sophisticated) with Titanic. Is it one of the best movies of all time? Not quite. Is it a really well-done film that stays in our minds years and years after seeing it for the first time and if it is playing on a TV channel, you put it on? Why, yes. I understand the bother with a ""pointless"" love story plot line for dramatization but what's funny is that it works with the strong performances and magical chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet. But what I want to focus on in Titanic is the little scenes. There are many scenes where the tears uncontrollably fall down your face. Towards more the last section of the film where the boat officially sunk down, there is a shot from sky above of all the passengers screaming and flapping around the water. Up close, it is suffocating hysteria and from afar, it is just one sound in the middle of the gigantic ocean. People being left to die (as there are themes being shown of the lower class being purposely cast aside and the rich prioritized) and people coming to terms this might be their last breath on earth. Playing with camera angles intensifies a small scene for a viewer and makes that small scene stand out in a 3 hour movie.",Titanic,Titanic - Movie Reviews
101,JOHN U,"Aug 29, 2021","Shmaltzy, overly long, ridiculously well crafted and disarmingly heartfelt this movie is just larger than life. I think it's pacing problems are best summed up by the very first scene where Bill Paxton's character essentially does the same gag twice with the exact same reaction from his crewmember. Everything that is done in the present day in this film is essentially useless and definitely provides the most unnecessary though not the only element that makes this movie as grandiose as it is. I was ok with it all, but it made the film seem redundant in a lot of places. Do the present-day scenes add to the film? Yes, but only incidentally, it does put us in the frame of mind of the impending tragedy in a very delicate way and makes for a very meaningful and lovely ending scene but all of that was accomplishable in much less time-consuming ways. After all, the love story is the heart of the film, it would have been perfectly acceptable to keep it to just that. What happens on the Titanic is what really sets this movie apart. At it's core this is a romance and that's what gives the wide appeal of the film but in general terms, this is an absolute masterclass (and I can't stress that enough) in disaster film. I got the feeling that that was what drew James Cameron to the Titanic as a potential film, the slow sinking of such a lavish set piece, the impending and ever nearing doom as the water chases after our heroes as they struggle to survive. It is in the disaster elements (and in the glorious shots of the Titanic before that) that the film is entirely justified in it's longevity. The scale of such a disaster demands a film of such scale and Cameron was certainly the filmmaker, perhaps the only filmmaker, who was truly up to the challenge of giving the Titanic justice. So in terms of destruction, this movie absolutely floored me not even mentioning the staggeringly large scale and lavish set design. The scenes in the engine room particularly gave off a visceral sense of largeness and power that was awesome to behold even on my computer screen and the shots of the Titanic's propellers rearing from the water literally took my breath away. Its like this movie's sets are beefy. That's the word that came to me while watching it, I don't know why but that's what I thought. Of course, no amount of excellent cinematography, special effects, set design, music or sound editing will make a complete film and since we all know the story, a genuine personal touch was necessary for this movie to really excel. Well, I won't call it genuine per se but I will call it just as larger than life than the ship it took place on. I don't think it's a secret to anyone just how melodramatic this movie's nuclear romance between poor artist Jack and unsatisfied rich girl Rose is. I suppose it's also cliché to a point but I didn't really mind (it helped soften the cliches when James Horner's score just leans into the schmaltz with full force) I think the film does a good enough job with building up it's emotional center and it sprinkles in enough universally pitiable scenarios (the musicians, the babies, the families) to make it personally devastating as the long, slow burn of the Titanic's destruction unfolds in all of it's glory. The story didn't really hold any long-lasting meaning, but I don't mind that either, it was just a story aiming to be a crowd pleaser and a white knuckler at the same time, and it succeeded really well at both. I liked the whole ""jump together"" motif. Somehow, I didn't see its payoff coming and old Rose throwing the heart of the ocean into the sea really spoke some volumes about something… I don't know, it was emotionally resonant at the time. Came for the destruction, stayed with the romance long enough to actually get to the destruction and enjoyed the sweet, admittedly pretentious ending.",Titanic,Titanic - Movie Reviews

James Cameron achieved something remarkable in Titanic, with his relentless attention to detail, perfect direction and clever use of every trick in the special effects book to take the viewer aboard the great ship as she set sail in April, 1912. The underlying Romeo and Juliet love story of the film's two central characters, Jack and Rose, is engaging and bought to life by the perfectly cast Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet, who have just enough chemistry to make you care about their love story. A fantastic supporting cast of quality actors, perfectly cast, helps to bring this modern remake of A Night To Remember to life. You realise you have completely bought into the movie when you feel utter dread during the sinking scenes. Definitely one of the all-time greatest movies ever made.

The set is magnificent and the contrast between rich and poor as well as society expectation and free will is handled really well but the moment the ship hits the iceberg, it's near perfect. You truly feel the tension and fright as we see the effect of the sinking on so many people as well as the (let's be honest) terrible organization of the crew and the visuals hage aged super well. Hard to believe it's a 1997 movie. And gosh that last half made me cry, seeing the hopelessness of many of the victims and of course, Jack's death. I'm still pissed that Jack died but that bastard Cal survived. But still, incredible. It's definitely slow at times.

It is still just the third highest grossing film ever (however part of that comes from the 3-D rerelease) and still is quoted and talked about constantly to this day. Now is it a perfect movie, no. Is it overrated, absolutely. But there is still such a great nature to it that makes it honestly hard not to love (at least slightly). The first 90 minutes of the movie is essentially just a chick flick (and the writing is not the best) but it has such a charm to it and Leo and Kate’s chemistry is so likable that you can’t help but enjoy it (even if it isn’t the best). Then the rest becomes a completely different movie almost, as we see the titanic sink. This is where the movie really becomes phenomenal. The effects done and the cinematography and shots we get are great. Even though I’ve never really liked James Cameron much as a person you deny that he is a great director, especially with action scenes like the end to the movie. The entire last half of this movie is completely thrilling to watch and also it is heartbreaking when (spoiler alert) Jack dies (but you probably already knew that).

127,Aidan B,"Nov 20, 2021","""The Force Awakens"" opens this new ""Star Wars"" trilogy to an entertaining start, with groundbreaking CGI and action sequences, this film is easily the best in the whole trilogy. The new characters and places introduced are not entirely fresh or memorable, though they fit well into the story. Speaking of the story, I thought that this film was heading in a very interesting direction by making Finn, a stormtrooper that betrays the First Order, learn the ways of the Force. I also liked the character Rey, though I don't think that she should've been the main focus of the film. Kylo Ren is a very well done and emotional character though, and his connection to Darth Vader adds all the more depth to his character. Where I think this film fails, however, is the constant fan service that is done, which isn't done in a very creative way, rather it seems more of a cheat for that extra ""Hey I recognize that"" moment. It often plays on the nostalgia of those that grew up with the previous films and uses that nostalgia to power its main story.

154,Jacob B,"Sep 16, 2021",Star Wars 7: The force awakens (A-) (90%) Movie had so much hype before it's release and j.j. Abrams did a good job with it. Really wish that there was a more cohesive story throught the rest of the trilogy which ticks it down a bit now for me. But this movie and the other movies of the trilogy work better on their own then together. This movie in specific is just a whole lot of fun. Love seeing the rise of Kylo Ren (my favorite character from the sequels) and Harrison Ford back in action. Fun watch but don't get to attached to where the plot is taking the story in the other movies.,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Movie Reviews

It has a large number of characters, and I like that each one has their moment to shine, that's a plus point. The actions of each character are completely justified, Thanos as the main antagonist is perfect, the reasons for which he acts are given and he gives more richness to the film. Anyway, you can not stay without seeing Infinity War, it is a good movie but I think it was enough for more, that if, this does not prevent you from enjoying it at all.",Avengers: Infinity War,Avengers: Infinity War - Movie Reviews

214,Jon M,"Sep 23, 2021","The word ""soulless"" covers most of my issue. The voice acting was entirely lacking heart, and in some cases was simply given poor direction. (Mufasa roars, and asks ""Is that a challenge?"" As if he's inviting Scar to tea.) John Oliver was entirely out of his depth, Ejiofor gives zero malice to the role, Beyonce over-sings every line, and Seth Rogen's perfectly played irreverence stands as the one bright spot.

215,Jayden D,"Sep 22, 2021","I have NOT been a fan of the rehashed remakes that Disney have put out as of late (Beauty & The Beast, Aladdin, Mulan...UGH...,Lady & The Tramp...not bad but mediocre) though I have 2 exceptions, The Jungle Book and this latest rendition of The Lion King. To be real, there's never gonna be a Lion King rendition that's gonna come anywhere close to the 1994 classic, let's be honest with ourselves. However for it's credit, this remake did not want to make me leave the theater in disgust. If anything it's a good movie that it's worth a watch, you just gotta dial down your expectations of the movie because some parts of it are kinda watered down and a bit of filler moments are put in there too which would explain this movie being 25 minutes longer than the original. Other than that, it does follow the script to the letter and makes for a good nostalgia high with modernized graphics. Props to the CGI team, this movie does look beautiful, probably the highest mark of the movie. It's not a bad Disney movie at all, the unfortunate part is that it does not surpass what the animated classic has already brought out to us and those are shoes that are almost impossible to fill so I can understand this movie falling short in some parts. It does make for a good comparison of what is being brought to this generation versus what my generation got as a kid growing up in the 90's.",The Lion King,The Lion King - Movie Reviews

It feels less like a remake or re-imagining than a remaster - viewers who want a new spin on a classic will be disappointed to find they are paying to see a movie they've already seen (albeit with a new coat of paint). While it's a shame that director/producer Jon Favreau added nothing new to this tale (despite proving his capabilities with 2016's vivid and fresh 'The Jungle Book') it manages to retain the soul of the original and is sufficiently entertaining. Excellent voice and vocal performances couple with stunningly life-like depictions of wild Africa and it's animal inhabitants to satisfy fans hoping to relive an old favorite, while offering new viewers an experience approximate to what the rest of us experienced in 1994, albeit with less facially emotive animals.",The Lion King,The Lion King - Movie Reviews

269,Michael S,"Dec 23, 2018","As any hardcore fan of the TV series knows, no actress was ever going to be able to fill the tights of icons like Honor Blackman and Diana Rigg. The producers should have known such fans would provide not an instant audience but an army of instant deplorers many of whom notoriously refused to even see the movie. What idiot producer then provides not just one unacceptable Uma, but adds a second unacceptable Uma in the bargain (Uma's dual role as both Emma Peel and nemesis)? Poor Uma never stood a chance, given she is a notoriously verveless actress especially compared to Diana Rigg. Uma turned out to be much more suited to originating roles that she was capable of playing (see Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill). As bad an idea as casting Thurman (or anyone in a film that shouldn't have been made), there was a great idea in casting Connery as the Bondian villain and this was the only potential drawing power the film really had (it was the only reason I went to see it!). Connery appears to be having the time of his life portraying the essence of maniacal glee. The script is awful, even if the science is not gibberish it's delivered at such breakneck speed it comes off as such. The actors spout dialogue at each other to zero reaction, like each one is occupying a separate room. Fiennes is credible in the action scenes, but otherwise is so bland as to blend into the wallpaper. If Patrick MacNee had feared being outdone in the role, they turned out to be groundless. If you actually need a reason to watch this, there are a few good moments reminiscent of Peel-era idiosyncratic oddball Avengers style moments, such as the Spectre-like villains meeting at a round table disguised as different colored teddy bears.",The Avengers,The Avengers - Movie Reviews

The two head off to the Ministry to meet Mother (Jim Broadbent), who informs them the Prospero project - an attempt to influence the weather - was sabotaged apparently by Emma Peel. Dr. Peel claims she is innocent, but she is sent to work alongside Steed to find the real culprit. Mother's off-sider, Father (Fiona Shaw), claims Peel suffers from a mental disease. They go off to visit Sir August De Wynter (Sean Connery), an old ally of The Ministry. He takes an instant liking to Peel, as they both share a love of weather. Steed and Emma follow a lead to Wonderland Weather - a business that artificially creates heat or rain with a special machine - where they discover two dead men in teddy bear suits. The members of a secret organisation - led by De Wynter - all wear teddy bear suits to disguise their identities. One of them, however, looks exactly like Emma Peel. Steed arrives in time to save Peel, as the double jumps off a roof and disappears. Steed and Emma go off to visit De Wynter at his mansion but are attacked by mechanical bees. Alice (Eileen Atkins), a Ministry agent, helps them to flee; nevertheless, De Wynter captures Emma who then tries to escape but finds herself trapped due to the mansion's ever-changing floor plan. She smashes her way through a window, and Steed rescues her. Back at Steed's apartment, however, Peel is arrested by Father, as Steed visits Invisible Jones (Patrick MacNee), a man inside The Ministry, to investigate the meaning of a map Steed found at Wonderland Weather. After viewing some photos of failed genetic experiments including cloning (revealing that the other Emma Peel is a clone), Steed determines Father is working with De Wynter. Father and Peel's clone capture Peel but are confronted by Mother, who is then incapacitated. De Wynter, controlling Prospero and the weather, confronts the world's leaders. He boasts that he controls the weather, and they will have to buy the weather from him, will pay a lot for it, and will have until midnight to pay... ""The Avengers"" is a 1998 American action spy film adaptation of the British television series of the same name that ran between 1961-1969. Warner Bros., the film's distributor, refused to allow any early press-screenings for movie reviewers that most releases attempt to generate interest in; such a decision is often made when a studio and/or distributor knows a film will not be received well and pre-release reviews would only be negative. The film was originally scheduled to open earlier in June 1998 but was pushed back until August, often referred to as the late-summer ""dumping ground"" for films that are not felt to be strong or worthy enough to open on the more lucrative holiday weekends in early summer. The film was a notable failure at the box office, grossing only $48 million worldwide, compared to its budget of $60 million. Mick LaSalle, of the San Francisco Chronicle, warned against poor editing and direction, explaining; ""There's.......some business involving a dead ringer for Emma going around causing trouble, and there's some mention of the word ""cloning."" Then all talk of that is dropped. Everything is dropped. After a slow opening, the 90-minute movie jolts into climax mode. What happened to the middle? Clearly, this wasn't just edited but gutted. No doubt they did us all a favor, but it doesn't help. Instead of just being a bad picture, the missing middle makes ""The Avengers"" a bad and weird and strangely off picture. One example: There's never a moment when Emma and Steed realize who the villain is. At first, they don't know. Next, they're in a titanic battle to the death. At one point, Emma is shackled and floating around in a hot-air balloon. I don't know how she got there. I must have blinked. Due to internal wrangling at Warner Bros., the decision was made to vastly cut down the running time after test screenings, reducing the 115-minute film to 87 minutes, sacrificing much coherence and continuity in the process. Key scenes removed included the opening sequence in which ""Mrs. Peel"" infiltrates and destroys the Prospero science installation; early trailers included the scene where she says the words ""How now brown cow"" in a false telephone box to gain admittance. The movie was originally scored by composer Michael Kamen, who included the original Avengers theme; however he was unable to re-score the film after the radical editing, so was forced to drop out. The recut version of the film was scored by Joel McNeely. The original script was used for the film's novelization and included all the material which were first shot and then removed from the film. The original cut has yet to surface; Warner Bros. has no plans to release a director's cut or special edition in any form, despite that director Jeremiah Chechik has offered to recut the film for free. The film was panned by critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes consensus reads, ""A TV spinoff that lacks enough energy to spin, The Avengers is an ineptly written, woefully miscast disaster."" The purists disliked it for its disrespect to the original series (particularly the introduction of a romance between Steed and Peel - a carefully ambiguous subject in the series). Newcomers were lost by all of the misfired attempts to capture the mood of the original. Rod Dreher in the New York Post called the film ""a big fat gob of maximum crapulosity, the kind of shallow, stupid, big-budget cow pile that smells of Joel Schumacher"", referencing the previous summer's likewise poorly received Batman & Robin, which also starred Uma Thurman. David Bianculli stated, ""This Avengers film is so horrendously, painfully, and thoroughly awful that it gives other cinematic clunkers like Ishtar and Howard the Duck a good name."" Jay Boyer in the Orlando Sentinel said ""The Avengers is, without a doubt, the worst movie of the summer"". Reception in Britain was equally hostile. The Birmingham Post stated ""The Avengers is being slated by critics as the worst film ever made - such a turkey, says one, that the makers should have handed distribution to (mass turkey producer) Bernard Matthews"". Alan Jones in The Radio Times stated ""The cult 1960s TV series gets royally shafted by Hollywood in this stunningly designed blockbuster that's stunningly awful in every other department... Terrible special effects and zero chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman make this notorious disaster a total waste of everyone's time and energy."" Commenting on the truncated released cut of the film, New York Times's Janet Maslin noted, ""At a pared-down, barely rational 90 minutes, ""The Avengers"" is short but not short enough."" I did not grow up with the original ""The Avengers"" (1961-1969) but I know of the show, the main characters and the actors. This is yet another example of a film that was slaughtered in the editing room when they reduced the 115-minute film to 87 minutes, sacrificing much coherence and continuity in the process. Everything in the film feels random, campy, poor and as said there´s no coherence nor continuity which gives us a very confusing film. With A-list stars like Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman and Sean Connery you´d think there would be potential, but the end result is far from it. All three seems to have no idea what´s going on due to mediocre direction. I reckon charm, style and fun was the main pillars of the tv-show, but with the film all of that is not in place. It´s a weird and strange unfunny film in many ways and you really struggle to find anything that is good about it. The effects are shoddy and the script silly in an Austin Powers way. Once the colourful teddybears appears in the film you realise that this film will never recover. Trivia: Peter Bart's book ""The Gross"" covered the film's unfolding disaster in great detail. Among other facts: Warner Brothers greenlit the film largely on the strength of a star-packed cast and their appreciation of Jeremiah Chechik's work on Diabolique (1996) and were horrified when seeing what the first cut was like. The first screening took place in front of a ""largely Spanish-speaking, working class"" audience in Phoenix, Arizona, who hated the film; the studio then forced Chechik to cut many of his favorite scenes, and conduct reshoots; and the final cut went from 115 to 89 minutes, and was completely incoherent. The studio even refused to hold further test screenings, or to have an official premiere before the film's August 1998 release. Ralph Fiennes said of the film, ""I think it's a badge of honor to have a real flop on your resumé"".",The Avengers,The Avengers - Movie Reviews

It's not deep and only clever in its small details, but it is well constructed, well paced, well choreographed and features the type of performances perfect for a cast of actors who are mid-level at acting, but big on charisma. The actual bits where the cars go fast are intense, intricate and extremely well staged & well executed. Even better, this movie features a central villain played wonderfully by Statham and a muscle-baddie played by the always amazing Tony Jaa, and while the latter is notably underused, both of them are a lot of fun to watch when on screen, giving the silly-but-likeable heroes a larger-than-life obstacle. Honestly I strongly recommend this movie if you like well-made movies that don't require any usage of the brain to enjoy; like, if you've had a long and frustrating day at work and you want to enjoy something explosive while simultaneously relaxing, Furious 7 more than does the job.

Statham is great in his limited screen time, and the script and characters are great but the director couldn't pull it together with tension and visual realism like Justin Lim somehow perfected with the 5th and 6th films. Even with all the crazy stunts and set pieces in those two films, if felt very thrilling and weirdly grounded. Some moments recreate that style to an extent, but other moments fall flat in visual unrealism. The final act/set-piece, while very stupid however, was pretty awesome though.

I knew this movie was going to be dumb - they've all been dumb up to this point - but most of the rest of them have been dumb in a fun way. Unfortunately this one really flirts with just being dumb in a dumb way. The plot makes very little sense when it's given an ounce of thought, and characters inexplicably trust others for no reason other than to keep things moving. The humor is more forced than usual, with characters rarely leaving their archetypes. This movie is filled with tropes and cliches, but this franchise is so influential that it's hard to tell if it's regurgitating these tropes or inventing them. Also, Dwayne Johnson is severely underutilized. All of that being said, of course it's still fun. It's got the fast cars and the stunts we're expecting. The movie is stuffed with easter eggs and inside jokes (cars don't fly!). The familial theme is there, although not as obvious as in the previous entries, and there are heartwarming moments.

However, the fun continues making it likeable and fun enough to watch. In here Jason Statham is brought as the villain who is obviously one dimensional but has a legitimate grievance. The send off of Paul Walker incredibly works well although some of the scenes look weird knowing he is not really there but the movie pays tribute to the tune of When I see you again specifically written for his passing. Finally the Rock continues to prove how badass he is in these movies despite a limited role in this one.",Furious 7,Furious 7 - Movie Reviews

333,Stephy S,"Oct 23, 2021","An overall improvement upon its predecessor. Frozen II is exactly what you'd want from a sequel, more songs, more charming character moments and interactions and some absolutely gorgeous animation! First off, with this being a musical, you got to have some good songs and Frozen II definitely doesn't lack in that department, with the highlights being Lost in the Woods, The Next Right Thing and Into the Unknown. The acting was also top-notch as you'd come to expect from the returning cast. Especially Kristen Bell and Jonathan Groff deliver on some exceptionally charming and delightful performances. But without a doubt, the biggest praise I can give this movie is the animation. Hot damn, It's truly something else. The water looks too real for an animated flick and the movement is just as great and fluent. The character designs are also very exquisite and distinct. Unfortunately, it isn't all sunshine and rainbows. Some characters are painfully underutilized. Kristoff gets kicked out of the story early on and doesn't get to do anything meaningful and the new additions to the ensemble of characters aren't used in any meaningful in creative ways. All of these characters seemed to have some great potential for fun and quirky character interactions and had some noteworthy chemistry. Finally, the world-building is hit or miss. They introduce some really cool concepts and themes into the universe but they feel a bit rushed and half-baked. Some of them could've been thought out a little better while others feel like they aren't properly explained to the audience. In short, Frozen II might not be a subversive and perfect sequel but it's still pretty solid. It's truly a miracle this movie still turned out so good considering the rushed and problematic production.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews
334,Jan B,"Oct 18, 2021","As we all know, Disney has completely taken over, especially when it comes to movies. Frozen 2, amongst the singing and dancing, deals with real issues, like growing up and finding your place, your purpose. Though it may be a little heavy for some younger kids, those who grew up watching the first frozen movie, like me, find a real message embedded in the plot and various popular songs. The songs are just one portion of how the movie is dealing with these issues, such as change. For example, the first song describes how some things will be the same no matter what happens. Things like family and friends and true love. However, as the movie progresses we can see that things change regardless of what we do, some quite ironically if I might add. In the first song they sing about how the flag will always fly, and as soon as the spirits wake up and show their wrath to the city, the flag is ripped from the flagpole with the wind. For characters like Anna, this is a hard realization that things are changing. In the same breath, as those things change, we figure out a way to handle the change for the better, and that not all change is bad. Another topic they deal with is growing up. The kids who watched the first movie when it came out, grew a whole 6 years before the second movie came out. For me, I was in high school and applying for college when the second movie came out. Growing up is a scary topic and it could evoke some unhappy feelings for younger kids, especially those who don't like change. Frozen 2 also implies some falsehood about growing up, ""When you're older, absolutely everything makes sense"", as adults, we know this statement doesn't ring very true. On the same note, as you grow and go through life, you can find your place in this world, your purpose, just like Elsa and Anna did. Elsa found her place in the enchanted forest as the fifth spirit, and Anna found her place as the queen of Arendelle, which is arguably where they both belong. Aside from the positives and negatives to Frozen 2, I honestly think it's a great movie. It is more suited for slightly older audiences, but the topics that this movie deals with are important, even the heavy ones. Everything changes eventually, everyone grows up, but growing up and changing isn't necessarily a bad thing. It can definitely be intimidating, but it does ring true that no matter what changes, things will be okay. In my opinion, that is a great message for kids who are scared of growing up and finding their place in the world, like I was.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews

352,Manuela B,"May 28, 2021","I want to speak about Frozen II. This film is directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, they had realized the first movie also. The mains characters are Elsa and Anna the voice respectively of Indiana Menzel and Kristen Bell. The movie was released on 2019 by Walt Disney Pictures. The film tells a story of two sisters who lost their parents during the first movie. Anna and Elsa lives in the Arendelle's castle, Elsa is the queen. After the death of their parents, Elsa heard a mysterious voice call out to her. So she left the castle and the citizens to follow this voice. Anna, her sister is stubborn as a mule, she follows Elsa during this adventure. Many things will happen Personally I love this plot, I find it entertaining, touching and also interesting. In Frozen , there are a lot of specials effects. Elsa has a power, she can built an ice house, frozen the way, make a snow. Her power is very captivating, and beauty. For exemple in Frozen I Elsa make a snowman for her sister. The movie is an animation, the draws are very well done. The characters to appears real. I saw the making of, and it is a very long work. The details are important, we can see the emotions, the feeling of the characters is interesting. For exemple when Elsa sing, there is a close up, we see the character's face , the profound emotion. I thinks the script is good. For exemple Olaf the snowman is hilarious, even if is a snowman, the characters is lovable. We can laugh when he makes a joke. I recommended this film,to anyone who loves the Disney animation. Seriously, when I see this film I can cry, laugh, have all emotions. Waltz Disney animation makes characters very captivating. Songs are choose with attention. Everybody know « let's it go » this song is moving. I'm full of admiration for Frozen. The animation is difficult, isn't easy. Waltz Disney makes a interesting job. I'm never be disappointed by Disney Animation. Really go to see this film because is incredible.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews

359,Jesse D,"May 05, 2021","7.0/10. Have you seen the first Frozen? If you have kids, like Disney films, or have a pulse, it's more than likely you answered yes. And given that yes is your answer, then you have already seen the better of the two films. While Frozen 2 is still a good film, especially for those with children to entertain, it doesn't reach the heights of it's predecessor in any appreciable anyway. The animation is as good as ever, the perfect voice cast from the original return, and this heroine-led story has action, laughs, and some meaningful moments. But so did the first Frozen, which did all of that, but better. While the narrative foundations for Frozen 2 are arguably stronger than the boiler-plate fairy-tale original, this film adds too many unimportant characters and slices the film into separate plots that aren't always engaging. The tear-jerker moments don't jerk as effectively and the soundtrack pales in comparison it's counterpart; it almost concedes the point when it uses motifs from the original on more than one occasion. That's not to say it does any of these things poorly - this movie has heart and a good soundtrack, but it stands in the shadow of one of Disney's biggest recent hits. Some things never change, including that Disney's freshest ideas are usually better than the retreads.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews
360,Dollores L,"Apr 24, 2021","I thought Frozen 2 was a whole lot better than the first one. In the first one it overall just made me frustrated at what they did and said. I wholeheartedly agree that the songs in the first movie are 100% better than the ones in the second (minus Olaf's solo). However, in the second the characters look way more mature. I was so surprised when I saw how good they actually looked. Yes, I know that looks aren't everything but I thought that that was something important that should be pointed out. In the second I didn't exactly understand the point they were trying to get across though. What really saved the movie, for me, and made it a whole lot better was Olaf. He is by far my favorite character and I am guessing most everyone else too. Olaf makes the most hilarious comments and his solo song made me and my whole family laugh. Not going to lie, without Olaf the movie would most likely be a dud. I liked the story line of trying to save the enchanted forest and it gave me some real Moana vibes. I thought all the element characters were well thought out and I especially had a soft spot for the adorable little fire lizard/gecko. My least favorite part of the movie is either during the opening song ""some things never change"" or when Christoph has his solo ""Lost in the woods"". I was cringing hard during both of these songs. The first one that I listed was extremely sappy and made me shudder multiple times during the song. As for ""Lost in the woods"" I thought it was the most cringy of all the songs. It looked like they were going for an old montage theme for that song. I actually went to get refills for my drink and popcorn during it because I was so unsettled. (the popcorn was delicious by the way 🍿) I thought the songs were all sung extremely well and they even had me singing along at some parts. (I don't think the others in the theater were impressed though) I wouldn't consider this a must watch to those who haven't even seen the first but if you have then you NEED to see this one too. By the end of the movie you will have had some good laughs and I honestly believe that it won't feel like a waste of time.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews

The writing is witty and handles all the characters differently but emotionally and mostly in a clever way, with stand out characters being Tony and Wanda but the real pinnacle of the film being Ultron. Much like the movie, the only reason he is not the best villain in marvel is cos we have so many great ones, because Ultron is a hilarious and threatening, well designed marvelous (see what i did there) mix of Tony, Bruce and Vision who has motives that line up with Iron Man's character leeding to real deep dives into the sea of his phyce. The story is mostly simple, with many well choreographed but somtimes boring fight scenes and lot's of exposition but you have to remember that it's introducing three new characters here AND trying to move development on for the Og's. The movie set's up further Marvel movies, like Civil War, and gives our heroes something internal to recon with while still leaving us asking questions that we know will be answered.

397,Cailan D,"Jul 20, 2021","Avengers: Age of Ultron unfortunately falls into the ""sequel is worse"" trap. The writing and directing lack the finesse that they had in the first Avengers and are both awkward at times. Ultron, though Spader gives a pretty good performance as him, isn't the greatest villain because it seems that he dislikes the Avengers for reasons that aren't personal to him. He attempts to come off as sort of a ""people person"" but ultimately fails to do so because of his goals and execution. The humor is decent but not as good as it is in other MCU installments and is hampered by the script. The biggest issue of Age of Ultron is that it's a very ambitious film and tries to do too much with its runtime. There are multiple stories going on so as to set up future movies and the movie would've done better with a more specific focus. All that said, the actors as usual do their best to overcome the script and are successful at doing so in many instances. The chemistry between them helps to carry scenes where other elements don't work as well. One highlight of this film is actually one of the low points of the first Avengers, being Clint Barton/Hawkeye. This movie treats him very differently than its predecessor and gives him more screen time and moments to shine. His speech to Wanda during the climatic battle is one of the best speeches in the entire MCU and his arc gives more depth to his character and leaves plenty of opportunities for future development and storytelling. The action sequences are entertaining enough and should keep viewers engaged for the full runtime. While Age of Ultron is far from the best the MCU has to offer, it has some redeeming qualities and is worth taking a look at.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,Avengers: Age of Ultron - Movie Reviews

However, with certain deaths revealed the true glorious purposes that those characters were burdened with. I saw some of them in different light, and it was very sad. The beginning started just a little bit slow, but after that, the movie became unrelentingly thrilling. Even though it's the shortest in runtime in the franchise, I was basically glued to the TV the entire time. I sensed so much urgency in Harry and could not be more invested in him and his allies. The ending did not disappoint and delivered plenty explosion, wizardry, and valor from the characters. Everyone united and faced the strong and desperate dark lord himself. It was glorious.

The one 1/2 down-grade I gave it was actually due to the final duel scene with Harry & Voldemort, right after Neville Longbottom kills Voldemort's snake, Nagini, with the Sword of Griffindor. The simple cracking of Voldemort's face and then scattering away in the wind in tiny pieces was a complete slap in the face to audiences that deserved a MUCH more intense demise after following this movie series for 10 years. Lets face it, if we started our kids on the first movie at age six, they would have been sixteen when the last installment was released. I'm fairly confident they could have handled a more severe send-off to one of the screen's most hated characters. Did anyone in the theater you attended applaud loudly and yell vocally when Voldemort was defeated. Our's was packed and not a peep from anyone when he was killed by Harry. There you have it.

This movie hardly competes with any other because of its circumstances where the somewhat flawed buildup was all shoved into a different movie entirely, leaving this one with the sole task of delivering a lengthy fan-service climax to the entire franchise with a practically unlimited budget and plenty of characters whose arcs were 95% finished. The plot revelations were the best part of the movie, followed by the special effects, then the acting prowess displayed by the leads (especially Fiennes and Bonham Carter in this one), then the dramatic and memorable film score. The most touching scene of the movie and perhaps the entire series for me was Hermione offering to go into the woods with Harry - it came off incredibly altruistic and human, hitting me right in the feels unexpectedly in a way that Snape's memories did not. There were some things I would've preferred to see happen with the characters than what did, though that's mainly a very minor gripe with the source material. This was extremely successful as an ending to the series and deserves its spot as the highest-rated movie in it, even if that's mostly for getting to adapt only the exciting parts of one of the novels.

If the previous three film (Order of Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince, and Deathly Hallows part 1) if these films were the resistance underground films, this one is the out and out war film with wall to wall action, separated by a few tender quieter moments in between. In the last stand battle of Hogwarts everybody showed their bravery. Dame Maggie Smith's Prof. Mcgonagall got a moment to show how badass she is taking over Hogwarts, and Neville Longbottom was one of the most courageous young wizards, standing up for the Dark Lord himself. He was so brave he earned the right to wield the Sward of Gryffindor and truly save the day. That said, the true sacrifice came from Snape, the most misunderstood hero of the story. He gave up his entire life and managed to live as an outcast for years just to protect Harry and fool the Dark Lord, he managed to have a final moment with Harry which just made me very emotional. The final showdown between Harry and Voldemort was short and sweet. The Dark Lord's hubris lead to his downfall after our heros managed to take him down piece by piece working together, and utilizing the Deathly Hallows for good not for personal gains. The film then was bookended with a happy scene at the train to Hogwarts 16 years later, with the new generation of wizards starting their first year at the school.

Does this film play heavily on your memories and nostalgia of a cinematic masterpiece? Absolutely. Is this a Hollywood blockbuster to entertain your kids and eat popcorn to? Most certainly. But beyond that, this is just poorly made. After finishing the film, I had to wrack my brain for hours to try to understand what I witnessed, and what it meant. And I've come to the conclusion that it is simply confused. Masterfully confused. It tries both to be everything at once and an intricately focus-tested action romp. It tries to be a skit comedy, an action-adventure, a space opera, a drama, a romance, and an action spectacle. And it fails on almost all counts. At very least it was entertaining. If you enjoy Star Wars, you'll see everything you want to see here. There are X-Wings, and blaster lasers; there are jedi and lightsabers; epic swordfights, big explosions, and more. It's quite fun if you don't take it seriously at all! But that's the inherent issue, isn't it? Star Wars isn't just some nonsense sci-fi romp; it's one of the biggest sci-fi epics in the entire genre's history.

It's a phrase for killing the past, deconstructing old beloved characters, having stupid plot twist for its own sake, having no respect for the old fans at all, pushing a political agenda and using a franchise to parading your own ego as a filmmaker. What Rian Johnson did here - as a filmmaker (not as a person), is unforgivable. Many fans watched Star Wars in their youth when they had troubled times - they looked up to the characters - especially to Luke Skywalker. It's not only a shallow action figure - it was a symbol of goodness and hope. ""The Last Jedi"" makes a bitter, cynid old grump of Luke - who cowardly nearly killed his defenseless nephew, left his friends and family alone and dies off alone in the end.

Considering that they didn't quite know where this story was heading to, I think Johnson did a fantastic job. The theme of failure being a lesson throughout the movie was really cool to see. It wasn't just blasters and action and everybody wins; it was much more layered than that. Luke being an irritable hermit to me was very fitting after what he went through. And on top of this was the intricate budding relationship with Rey and Ben Solo was great. It showed them both of having flaws and I think that's needed in the Star Wars Universe more. Both feel lost and hopeless and alone, but they realize they have a connection this way. Is it a healthy relationship? Not at all but I like that it showed the grey of their personalities inside such and black and white universe. Also, bringing back the puppet Yoda made me tear up in nostalgia.

The script doesn't help--at every possible opportunity, the story is forced to be some sort of swelling, dramatic, climax--strange, since it is hard to feel anything given how soulless it turns out to be.

Rian Johnson is on record of saying the best films are ones that half the audience likes and the other half hates. Mission accomplished. Though I'd say it was 10/90 like/hate. The film's story had no cohesive structure. It was more like multiple, unrelated subplots hewn together like a kindergarten level collage.

The Last Jedi breaks everything we know as a trilogy... and that's perfect. You just have no ideia of what to expect, because actually, everything can happen at anytime, and things really does happen. Director Rian Johnson knows what make a Star Wars movie and a great sci-fi epic, setting the bars pretty high for this one visually, technically and narratively, not just making it a love letter for the real fans, but putting it up there with The Empire Strikes Back in a kind of surprising manner, while also setting it apart from his older ""trilogy brother"" by the inventively corageous plot, the gorgeous presentation and the mind-blowing twists.",Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,Star Wars: The Last Jedi - Movie Reviews

The lack of world building is prevalent The most idealistic person in the galaxy was turned into a cynical and brooding hermit. The fact that the true escape plan is kept from Poe Damaren is infuriating. They kill off Snoke and Captain Phasma before any arc can be established. Their main character is so utterly forgettable. Instead of exploring Finn's background they turn him into a bumbling idiot. He could of been a scarred anti-hero with a dark past. By attempting to subvert the viewer's expectations the film makers subverted all the fun right out of the movie.

Also, the Holdo maneuver would have been more effective at the beginning of the chase, thus saving the rest of the vessels of the resistance. Also, where is the rest of the New Republic military.

Here are my reasons: - Memorable and well developed characters. - An original and well-executed story. - A soundtrack that was only surpassed! like photography, it's the best! The original essence of the first movies is back! and the CGI is great! It is very well worked, you can see the dedication with which it was made. - Finally, we cannot forget that we will open the doors for what is to come in 2022 in Jurassic World: Dominion!

509,huyqiwd s,"Jun 24, 2021",Okay this movie sucks. I'll start with everything I hate. The movie is really cheap and it starts off with with claire wanting to save the dinosaurs even though they should be extinct. She cries about it. The trailers are also annyoing they just showed every single good part of the movie to make you think it is going to be good. They showed all of jeff goldblums performance and they try to shove in so many dinosaurs. It has an allosaurus a carnotorus a baryonyx a synoceratops and of course they are going to make rexy kill off the bad guy at the end. It is too predictable but perhaps the worst thing about this movie is they keep copying the other ones and they do that to much. It is basically the lost world but in a more modern way. The plot twist about the clone girl is stupid the characters are stupid and all while this is going you have bad acting unnecessary scenes and overall a horrible plot. The first scene is the only good scene in the whole movie. I think the worst actor of all is bryce dallas howard chris pratt was okay I don't know why he is so good with this role but so bad when he plays stare lord in the mcu. Speaking of marvel the jurassic world movies have so many actors that have been in marvel movies for example chris pratt bryce dallas howard ty simpkons vincent d'nofrio sam neil jeff goldblum jake johnson but that's not really there fault.

This is hands down one of the best musicals Disney has created. This starts with the amazing work of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez who were the song composers for this film and Christophe Beck who was the score composer. The score wonderfully sets the backdrop and the songs are all memorable and work so well with the themes and character arcs. The casting is also perfect as all the main character voice actors have experience performing on Broadway. The work on the animation is also well done with great particle effects for the snow and noticeable improvements on human hair. I understand the oversaturation of this film in pop culture, however I fully believe it is well deserved.

The first part was released in 2013 and made a splash. 3 Speaking of the plot, it is quite heavy even for an adult, because even my parents were touched by the plot. The drawing itself is at a height, everything is very clear and every detail is drawn, which pleases the eyes. One of the most important things is that even though it is a cartoon, but all the emotions are perfectly conveyed and touch the soul. Thanks again to the smallest details, you can very well understand each character, well, except for Prince Hans( my most hated character). Of course, the cartoon has a sequel, this is its second part, but the first one will always remain in my heart. Although, I don't mind the third part) so ""Frozen"" is the best animated film I've ever seen.

It really differs from your average Disney movie as it isn't based on ""true love kiss"" and ""boys"" and ""I need a prince to rule."" The characters are hilarious and make you smile. But if you are watching with kids you will probably be hearing ""Let it go!"" for weeks on end. Even as a teenager now, my little sister puts it on and I sit with her and actually enjoy most of it.

570,Dale R,"Nov 15, 2021","A live action remake of the 1991 animated film of the same name. There are some big names in this film: Emma Watson as Belle, Dan Stevens as Beast, Luke Evans as Gaston, Josh Gad as LeFou, Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, Ian McKellen as Cogsworth, etc. They all do a great job with what they are given, except for the music. With the exception of ""Gaston"", all the songs in this film feel unemotional and over processed. Some of this, I feel, is due to the fact that there is limited musical theater experience with the actors chosen for this film. Ewan McGreagor is good, but he can't hold a candle (pun intended) to Jerry Orbach's many years of musical acting experience. The CGI for the Beast's face was lacking and I'm sure it hid a great facial performance from Stevens. There were a couple of scenes where Watson felt like a stick saying, or singing, lines. The added material didn't feel necessary to the story, though some of the plot holes from the original film were plugged. Nostalgia fueled the success of this film and maybe that will be enough for you to enjoy it as well.",Beauty and the Beast,Beauty and the Beast - Movie Reviews

589,Urainia S,"Jun 07, 2021","I really love the moral behind ""Beauty and the Beast"", and it's the only Disney romance which still gets me. It's an important lesson about the ideas behind the curse of Beauty. In my mythological soup, this stands for The Judgment of Paris, where Aphrodite was chosen as the fairest (Athena DID NOT like this) because of her ability to provide a beautiful wife for the shepherd prince. The Beast becomes a Beast in mind because he has objectified his kingdom through beauty. Beast is a stand-in for Mercury, and/or Dionysus, and that's why the beautiful Athena-like witch shows up in ugly drag to test his hospitality. When he turns the witch away based on exterior appearances, not recognizing the beauty of her wisdom, she curses his kingdom to be physical objects until Beauty reappears. Then it's up to Beauty to reverse the curse through her wisdom, by seeing past the objectification of the Beast as a horrible animal to locked up in a mansion with his material things. It's important here that Belle is the hero. The Beast can't fix himself, he's the victim, and only someone who reads books and doesn't just stare at the covers can put it all together before the rose loses her last petal...",Beauty and the Beast,Beauty and the Beast - Movie Reviews

Best parts of the movie were indeed the raccoon, Jack-Jack, and scenes with Edna Mode. During the latter parts of the movie, I literally just wanted it to end. Three years (2015-2018) of waiting for this movie, walked out extremely disappointed. Watched it for the second time last night, no, just an absolute no. I understand the animation was smoother. But certain scenes were ""cut"" too sharply. The ending of Edna Mode's scene was abrupt, cant quite describe it. If you watch it at that point, you'll understand. So sad. There was so much potential.

627,Jacob R,"Jul 03, 2021","Ok, so this movie is pretty good, and has all the good stuff from the original movie, but it has a few too many problems that prevent it from being as good as the first movie. First, all the things that I thought were basically spectacular. All the stuff that involves them actually being superheros is really good, not better then what was in the first, but still really good. Next is the animation, which feels very different then all the others. This feels like it's stylized for the 1950s, which the film takes place. Some people can find that distracting, but I didn't. Also, all the new characters are either good or funny, except for one thing, but I'll save that for a little later. Now, let's talk about all the things that this movie just didn't do well enough in, which keeps it from being as good as the original. The main thing is really the characters that are brought back. Except for Elastagirl, Frozone, and Jack-Jack, all the old characters feel significant weaker. I don't want to say this, but the worse character in this movie by far is Mr Incredible. He is either acting completely crazy, completely mean or ignorant, or is not really blaming himself for everything that is going wrong with the family. I'm sorry, that's a huge problem that you can't fix with just one scene. Violet and Dash seem weaker too, but I was able to look past them. I, however, cannot look past Mr Incredible. Also, another big problem is the stupid twist villain. I know Pixar has done them before, but only one of them was actually bad (Miles Axelrod from Cars 2 ring a bell for anyone?). That is…until the Screenslaver shows up. This was the first time I was able actually to predict the twist villain in a Pixar movie, which made it super boring. It's also really hard when the last villain in this franchise, Syndrome, is the best Pixar villain ever. So, with all of that said, I still think this a good film that everyone should watch. All the superhero stuff (besides the villain), is still spectacular, you're just gonna have to sit through a bunch of the family stuff that isn't as strong. I think that's the biggest difference between this movie and the original. ""The Incredibles"" is a family and character study first, and a superhero movie second. ""Incredibles 2"", however, is a superhero film first, and a family film second. If you don't mind the change, then you'll think this movie is great! If not, like me, you'll only think the movie is pretty good, almost great. But hey, why listen to me? Go to Disney+ and watch this almost ""Incredible"" movie!",Incredibles 2,Incredibles 2 - Movie Reviews

But anyway, that's just a minor inconvenience. I hope that's the only problem I have with this movie, other than probably the fact that it's nowhere as memorable as the first movie. While The Incredibles is something of a pop culture icon this movie is, well, let's just say we'd have never learnt about it if it wasn't advertised so much. Incredibles 2 starts off from the part where the prequel left. And it finally answers the question of what happened in the fight between the Parr family and the Moleman - It... Happened. The only thing that came out of it was that Violet's BF learnt about her identity, which was later wiped out (or so I remember, I don't even think this movie was memorable enough. I'm remembering all the scenes as I'm writing this). So now Helen is out on another adventure, leaving Bob with the kids. And he's terrible at handling them. It was a very funny scene, seeing him struggle everyday trying to help Dash with his homework and Jack Jack in changing his diapers. The family moves into a new home which is way better than their previous one. Dash and Violet discover Bob's car and they bring it home. Then something something Helen finds out the guy who she's working with has a sister who is her costume designer, and she's secretly evil. And now it's up to the kids to save the day with all the superpowers and plot armours. See this is exactly the problem of this movie. It is super predictable, although that's not a bad thing since the way those scenes are executed make it very satisfactory to watch. The animation of this movie is probably the best thing about it. It is one of the only things which has improved drastically since the first movie. The Incredibles, you might remember, was very cool. But I just wrote a review of it yesterday and it was then that I realised the quality of that movie has aged terribly. In terms of polygon count this one takes the win. However, I also mentioned in that review that the thing which makes The Incredibles so much fun to watch is that it feels like a videogame, something similar to Sonic the Hedgehog or Spider-Man for PS4. That's not something I could say about this movie. Incredibles 2 isn't one of the movies Pixar is known for making. It's something of a sequel that can only satisfy you that the fight in the end of the first movie didn't end on a suspenseful note. It is a one-time watch for the fans of the first movie, although the kids might like it since the movie seemed to be more oriented towards them.",Incredibles 2,Incredibles 2 - Movie Reviews
632,Jerry S,"Jun 17, 2021","(SPOILERS) Honestly I am almost tempted to say I like Incredibles 2 better that the original. The characters are great as always and there is some real character development the music is spot on and I really enjoyed the moments between Bob and his kids and the awesome action sequences between Helen her self. I honestly have a blast watching this sequel, however the only problem that I have with this movie is the villain Evilen Deavor. On the one hand her character is really great. She and her brother Winston Deavor have interesting and intense back stories and have good moments with each other, however the movie kinda drags just a tad because there really trying to hide the fact that one of them is the main villain. Another thing is that Evilen's plan can kinda get confusing at times. However that doesn't mean that it takes away from the movie itself though. There is this seen with the Screen Slayer a villain that Evilen herself created and has some of coolest moments in the movie. However going into that seen though there are flashing lights so you have been warned. That scene was pretty thrilling and even haunting. However the best action scene in the entire movie was the opening which was just straight awesome and so satisfying.

Of course it's not the original but it took a well known story and added onto it perfectly. I enjoy how it focused on Elastagirl and really showed how before becoming a house wife she was a force to be reckoned with. I think the villain was very unique and there was a good twist added in.

659,Jean L,"Jul 09, 2021","The Fate of the Furious continues the downhill spiral of mediocrity that is the fast and furious franchise. Once a fairly ok but fun series of movies about street racing and fighting organized crime has now become a multi million dollar franchise about extraordinary heist crime action that defies the laws of physics, stupid characters, plot devices that make no sense, and just simple stupidity. Previous movies are fun enough to watch including this one but it does not make it good. In this one Dominic Toretto played by Vin Diesel betrays his team of street racers turned into international crime fighters with nice cars. The story is completely ludicrous although it tries to make some sense but in the end is just dumb. The villain played by Charlize Teron is badass and formidable as Teron brings her incredible presence that she carries into every movie yet the character motives are questionable and flat out cartoony. The only fun thing here is The Rocks and Jason Stahams chemistry which is hilarious and great which led to the spin off Hobbs and Shaw. Otherwise the rest is a bunch of explosions and impossible action pieces in a movie universe that is supposed to be realistic and is now trying to mimic superhero movies. This franchise is losing steam.",The Fate of the Furious,The Fate of the Furious - Movie Reviews

That's the dumbest thing to have in a FF movie. Rewatch this before seeing F9 tomorrow. Not gonna bother talking about the story, cliche dialogues, villain that only say stuff slowly and slam the keyboard, or family stuff, because that is just a vehicle for the movie to exist, so that they can lay waste to as many cars as possible. It is important that after watching too many movies, you just gotta turn your brain off and enjoy a dumb movie. And the later installments of this franchise is just what I need. Watching so many cars getting destroyed and blown up was crazy fun. The best scene was for sure the remote car control scene. It was ridiculous in all the entertaining way. Dwayne as Hobbs and Jason as Shaw were great as usual. I like both of them, and Dwayne displaying his alpha body was just great.

The first part of the movie was enjoyable and fun, but Gary Gray tends to drag it a little too much towards the end. It is obvious what was gonna happen and, honestly, I expected more fireworks and CGI magic.

I watched the extended edition of this film, which in my opinion was perfect (you can rent it for the same price on Amazon). The humor and action were really good in this movie, and I loved some of the twists and turns in this movie. While it could've been generic, as suggested by some of the trailers, this movie constantly stays unique IMO. While it is VERY over-the-top, it didn't feel nearly as stupid (in a bad way) as the last one.

Paul Walker's absence is felt throughout, but thankfully this isn't a major plot point and doesn't hold the film back from having fun. I appreciated that the writers took this film in a slightly (really very slightly) different direction by having some betrayal within the group. Dwayne Johnson finally feels utilized in this entry with far more screen time and humor than in predecessors. The physics in this one are outrageously unbelievable as always, but the stunts and set pieces are impressive. I was hesitant about Shaw's redemption arc at first, but it proved to be quite satisfying and effective.

Some people complain Tony is not in a suit enough and sure, but isn't that kind of the point?

703,Nathan D,"Sep 05, 2021","Iron Man 3 was such a joy to watch as there were so many great moments throughout the film. The script is solid and doesn't shy away from any aspects, which leads to a great viewing experience. The main villain of the movie is rooted, and his motives are clear. Is he the best villain? No, but he gets the job done. The character arcs in this film are so much better here than in the second installment. Tony grew as a person and was able to become a better person overall. If I had to nitpick the script, I think I would have toned down the political tones a bit. It began to be a lot at times which I think was unnecessary. Another thing was that it felt a bit predictable at times. Using the shady businessman for the third time in a row does get a bit repetitive. Shane Black does a stellar job directing this installment and is on par with Favreau's work on the first film. There were plenty of scenes that felt inventive and unique, making the film have very few dull moments. Even with the more serious scenes, it still had the emotion it needed to be entertaining. To accompany Black's directing is some solid cinematography from John Toll. There are a lot of shots that look very nice and have some significant elements to them. Sadly, those two aspects get brought down by the harsh editing in the film. The action sequences have too many cuts leaving the scenes to feel rushed and messy. There are even a few scenes where some cuts don't match up with the shot before. The score does make up for this as it keeps the energy up in some of the scenes. Composer Brian Tyler created this bombastic score that impacted the film profoundly. The production and set design are also very attractively done. Many visually appealing locations complimented Shane Black's vision quite nicely. The cast also does a fabulous job here with stand-outs all around. Like always, Robert Downey Jr. shines on screen. This performance is the most human he has felt in any of the three Iron Man movies as he and Black translated what was on the script to the screen very nicely. Gwyneth Paltrow continues to do great in the role of Pepper Potts. Although, her performance in Iron Man 2 is still the best out of the three movies. Ben Kingsley is outstanding here and created a lot of entertaining moments in the film. I can see why some people do not like his performance, but I thought he was a lot of fun. Guy Pearce is also a solid addition to the cast. His acting seems bland at times, and it does not help that his character is somewhat the same as the other two films in the franchise. Supporting cast members like Ty Simpkins, Rebecca Hall, and Don Cheadle are fantastic in the movie. Overall, Iron Man 3 is an action-packed blockbuster that is so enjoyable to watch. The film does have a few blemishes in the script and editing department. Yet, the entertainment factor helps hide it at times. An exceptional cast, an outstanding score, and marvelous directing make Iron Man 3 a stand-out film in Marvel's cinema catalog.

The villain is generic and forgettable, and the twist is rather insulting, especially to hardcore fans. The suit that makes Iron Man who he is comes off nigh-indestructible in every other Marvel film, now the thing just flies to pieces if he gets hit just a little too hard? And he spends less than a quarter of the movie in it. Wow, how inspiring. I get that they were trying to go for 'Iron Man is the MAN, not the armour', but it just falls apart.

709,Ethan T,"Aug 25, 2021","Iron Man 3 is an average popcorn superhero film saved by Downey Jr. in the lead role. His smarmy yet lovable Iron Man is always a sight to behold. The action alternates between a decent showcase of big-budget CGI and illogical messiness. Paltrow and Downey work well together and Don Cheadle and Paul Bettany (voice) seem to have fun. Simpkins is a rare likable child star, but the positives end there for the supporting cast. Guy Pearce brings all of the campiness and not much else for a villain. Ben Kingsley is very welcome in another villainous role but does little to justify his inclusion apart from a bit of hit and miss comic relief. The comic relief in general does not completely miss, but could be stronger and telegraphs much of its humour in advance. Rebecca Hall did alright, though it's another case of her not quite bedding into admittedly daft proceedings as with Transcendence.

But, someone did make a good point about Marvel making all of the villains in witty comedy pieces. It happened with Loki in ""Loki"" and ""Thor Ragnarok"", Zemo in ""The Falcon and The Winter Soldier"" and The Mandarine in ""Iron Man 3"". It isn't really the best ideas to make people who tried to kill everyone on the Earth best friends with the main characters. Robert Downey Jr. always puts out his best as Tony Stark. The Ironman franchise is one of my favorite trilogies in cinema history. I'm sad his story is over, but I am so happy about his character arc throughout the MCU.

732,Christian K,"Aug 19, 2021","Honestly it's difficult to choose which is the most deranged film I've seen this week, Being John Malkovich or Minions. Minions does feature a 'hypno-hat' which enables the wearer to hypnotise whoever is in front of them and take control of what they're doing. So there is a slight link between the two films there. I've only seen the first two Despicable Me films (2010/2013) and they're pretty decent; nothing groundbreaking but a nice idea played out well. Minions is arguably the most inevitable spin off movie in film history, and unsurprisingly there's a sequel due next year. The sensible route seemed to be using the film to tell a minion origin story, and the opening sequence that explains the minions route through the earth's timeline is good fun, telling us how they've always wanted to serve some terrible evil master. We know where the film will probably end, and sure enough, it does, but it's produced well enough to hold the attention span of children and adults alike, even pre-schoolers will preoccupied for ninety minutes (mine certainly was). It's also absolutely bonkers, and I think to make this work the producers had to double down on the madness (or double up if you will) which is exactly what they have done. A lot of it is set in London, and there's plenty of shots of people drinking tea, as well as an extended cameo from an animated Queen Elizabeth II. But I understand that this description might not sound anywhere near as insane as a Charlie Kauffman film.",Minions,Minions - Movie Reviews
733,Puroo R,"Aug 09, 2021","I had watched Despicable Me just to understand the memes and to get within the lines of the pop culture. I never understood the deal with the Facebook memes which have pictures of Minions in them and have quotes written next to them. So I used to think Minions always speak out funny one liners for the audience to have a quick laugh at. After watching Despicable Me I realised this was nothing but cheap publicity, but then I decided to watch the whole franchise anyway, and so here we are. After having watched the original trilogy, this one feels a step back, but that doesn't mean it isn't entertaining enough. Minions is a spin-off to the Despicable Me franchise (the name of the franchise is Despicable Me or Minions, I will never know). This tells the story of how the Minions found Gru and became his, well, minions. In the beginning the Minions were only wild animals who used to serve whoever was evil. They move on from one master to another, until they have none left. And that's when three Minions set out on an adventure - Bob, Kevin and Stuart (isn't it funny that they have English names even though they were born before humans existed?). The franchise has a really good animation style. It looks cute enough to be memorable, especially seeing the Minions take part in activities in the things they see for the first time. Even the action scenes of these movies are incredible. Scarlet Overkill being shown as a total badass and then getting her comeuppance made this movie so much fun to watch. Queen Elizabeth's mockery was also very funny, especially the part where one of the Minions tries to pull the sword out of the stone. The ending with Gru was also very unexpected and gave the movie a happy (?) ending. What this movie lacks in, however, is the storytelling. This is not a good movie, but rather a good ""enough"" movie. There's nothing in this which you haven't seen before. The plot is mostly predictable, many parts are very annoying to watch, especially Scarlet being a generic female villain who always wins with martial arts. Other than Queen Elizabeth and Herb there weren't any memorable characters. Herb was memorable and still I forgot his name. Minions is one of those movies I can imagine kids going crazy over, since the movie is targeted only for them. If you're an adult you will find this movie very childish. It's not like the Despicable Me trilogy which is fun for the whole family. It has just selected all the things which made the franchise marketable and went all out in showing them here, namely, Minions.",Minions,Minions - Movie Reviews

There are non-meaningful fights, like Bucky vs Black Panther, or even the airport scene in this film. But the final fight here between Cap & Iron Man is a meaningful fight—and simply sad, especially as Baron Zemo watches from a distance with pleasure. I'd much rather see villains fight against each other (Doctor Doom vs Magneto vs Ultron vs Loki vs Thanos vs Carnage, anyone?). What was cool was introducing Spider-Man and Black Panther, and going deeper into Vision & Wanda's relationship. The plot was generally fine (even if you were semi-familiar with the comics version of the plot) but the circumstances causing the final fight seemed contrived.

I really enjoyed this in Age of Ultron, and to SOME degree here, but the talking here seems artificial to promote the highlight of this film where each side poses before fighting the other side. The disagreement over the Sokovia Accords seemed just dumb, and both Tony and Steve seemed like they were on the flip side of where they should be. Really? Tony is going to not go save someone when a bureaucrat in Belgium tells him not to? I get character growth and guilt and all, but please.

That makes the movie almost impartial, which was a super-intelligent idea because everybody could be a villain. The action sequences are spectacular and the introduction to new characters added to the development of existent and returning ones are perfect. Tom Holland (Peter Parker/Spider-Man) and Chadwick Boseman (King T'Challa/Black Panther) are two of the best characters of this universe.

Pretty great cast with Patrick Wilson, Amber Heard, Dolph Lundgren, Willem Dafoe and Nicole Kidman. Probably ranks up there with Black Panther for most colourful movies.

Though the acting isn't great by any means, and the story is kind of generic, Aquaman is selling what is literally says on the tin; a bro-ish superhero, with fish-powers, must save the World from his evil brother, whose powers are similar to his. Aquaman isn't my favourite character by far in the cinematic universe, but he does stay true to his portrayal in the comics, unkempt and brooding with a few quips here and there. I liked him far more in a solo film than I did in Justice League, as it seemed too many of the team had similar attributes and he just didn't stand out. Black Manta, being one of my favourite comic book villains, was also excellently portrayed by Yahya Abdul-Manteen II. Aquaman works better than the previous films because it doesn't need a lot of exposition and time to get to the root of the story.",Aquaman,Aquaman - Movie Reviews

Luscious visuals, incredible special effects world, great supporting cast including Oscar winners Kidman and Defoe with many stellar performances. Biggest drawback was the female lead did not have the chops to keep up with Momoa nor the chemistry to hold the position of female lead and love interest! She was barely tolerable and that God-awful red wig... At least director Wan did not have her use a hideous British accent like in the Snyder cut of Justice League. Her poor acting and general vibe left a bad taste in otherwise great movies. But I digress, this is an Aquaman review. Aquaman is an over the top character that is bigger than life. Momoa takes a character that was made fun of for many years and makes him cool. He makes this superhero someone you want to hang out with, without needing to use his powers. Wan did a nice job showing Curry's early life and showed how he became the person we are following now. Long live Aquaman!

845,Cailan D,"Aug 06, 2021","Aquaman is one of my favorite films from James Wan and shows that the director is capable of handling multiple genres. Aquaman may not be the best movie we've seen in the DCEU, but it's by far the most fun and entertaining and has the most rewatch value. The visuals are phenomenal, the fight sequences are fantastic and the premise is pretty good too. The acting supplements all this really well; all the big actors do great jobs with their roles and Jason Momoa is a surprisingly good casting choice for Arthur Curry. This movie is a solid origin story for Aquaman that I only wish we'd had before the Justice League disaster so we could've had context for character upon seeing him in a big group setting, although the movie does play off of Curry's appearance in Justice League nicely. Patrick Wilson is a very welcome face in this movie for me and fans of the Insidious and Conjuring franchises and marks his 5th collaboration (I believe) with Wan. Wilson shows how good of an actor he is in this movie. I appreciate how this movie made good use of all it's big-name and A-list actors; it didn't squander any of them and gave an actor we haven't seen too much of before the film the spotlight a few times. I do wanna reiterate a point I made earlier now about the movie being fun. Aquaman struck a very different tone and mood than pretty much every other film in the DCEU; the other movies have been very serious or comedic, but haven't been so in ways that make them truly entertaining. Aquaman has a very different vibe from the rest of the DCEU, and it's a breath of fresh air. Aquaman wants to be a fun movie and succeeds in doing so, and it's a movie I could watch 5 or more times and still be entertained by, a luxury I don't personally have with any other film in the DCEU. All that said, Aquaman isn't a perfect movie, and it's biggest fault for me is the dialogue. It's really cheesy, cringey and corny at times and without the great performances from the actors some scenes would be really awkward, stupid and unwatchable. Some the actors, especially Patrick Wilson, have to be on their A-game to keep a straight face while they say their lines due to how ridiculous the dialogue is at times. Honestly, if the dialogue had been better, this movie probably would've been a perfect 10 for me since everything else about the movie works really well; the dialogue is something I hope they work on and refine in the sequel, which according to Wan started filming recently. Overall, Aquaman may not be perfect or the best movie in the DCEU but it's a fun, entertaining and action-packed movie and has some of the best rewatch value of the whole DCEU.",Aquaman,Aquaman - Movie Reviews

The infamous Minas Tirith battle scene, the heroics at the Black Gate, Arogorn's speech, the brotherhood between Legolas and Gimli, the corruption of Frodo by the Ring... it's just cinematic perfection and there may never be a movie series to rival LOTR, particularly not in the fantasy genre.

It adapts by far the worst source material of the three and really pays the price for it with one of the worst cases of deus ex machina in movie history (the ghosts); the director thankfully chose to excise the worst chapter of writing Tolkien ever produced, that being the Hobbits returning to the Shire to find that Saruman has taken it over, but a lot of the buildup to Frodo's eventual character-ruining refusal to destroy the ring was internal and wasn't conveyed in the movie. We are instead left with a protagonist (who had already become worthless halfway through the second movie) making a heel turn long after all respect for him had been lost. I think a few of the Oscar wins this received was based on accrued appreciation for the trilogy as a whole and a lack of significant competition in '03.

884,Puroo R,"Jun 22, 2021","This is my third and final review of the trilogy. In the first movie's review I called it an RPG game and mentioned on how the world building was done adn how great the visuals were. In the second review I said it was like watching a book come to life and talked about the character development and philosophy/message the movie gave. In this third review I have called it an art and here I will talk about the story and why it will be remembered not just as a masterpiece, but also as a legacy. Keep in mind that all the reviews have been written separately but all of them imply to all three movies. The Lord of the Rings is one long story that has been divided equally among three movies. Because of this there is virtually no major difference between the them, and all the three movies have received almost the same ratings. Normally in trilogies the stories do not directly pick up from where the last one left but rather these are three different stories, because of which it is possible to have two great movies and one movie which does not live up to them (Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, Christopher Nolan's Batman, the original Star Wars trilogy, Godfather etc), or there is one great movie while the other two don't live up to that (Zack Snyder's Superman, Star Wars prequel and sequel trilogies, Jurassic Park etc). Here the risk was much bigger. Since there is just one story, either the entire trilogy would have been good or the entire trilogy would have been bad. This is why the movies were so long. The story is set in a fantasy world and not everyone has read the original books by JRR Tolkien. So Peter Jackson had to elaborate every minor detail. There should have been no questions left. The audience should've had a clear idea of what they were watching. Normally such things are only possible in TV shows which are book adaptations like Game of Thrones or The Man in the High Castle since they have enough time in their hands to explain everything. This, however, was a movie series. This is the reason why the runtime is so long. The total runtime of the trilogy is 10+ hours, and 12+ hours if you watch the extended cut. Another major problem that could have plagued this movie, if it wasn't addressed, was the number of characters and the fact that all of them were in different places doing different things. There were some minor characters right in the beginning of the story and some in the middle. All of them had to be humanised, something which is possible only if we get to know more about them. Because of this the story is moved forward such that we are made to care about all of the people. While we ask what happened to Gimli and Legolas in the battle, we are also worried that Frodo has been tricked by Gollum and is about to be eaten by a giant spider. The direction does not shift in the bias of any of the characters, otherwise the ones the audience cares about would have been left behind. People often make fun of the half-hour long epilogue shown in the end of The Return of the King, but imagine if it was not there. So many characters would have received vague endings. This was meant to assure that all the good characters got good endings and the bad guys got bad endings. I'd also take a moment to talk about Gimli and Legolas' relation. In the beginning they both hated each other but later on they grow to become friends. This is another great message that the movie sends us. In my previous review of philosophy I didn't mention it because it was seen in this movie. It talks about how we hate some people based on their appearance, their beliefs, their way of life. But we end up becoming friends with those same people once we actually interact with them. People were never meant to hate each other. This is something we are taught to do. This is also seen when Aragorn unleases the Army of the Dead. They never wanted to work with the living because of their hatred, but when one of them came forward and made the request, they gave in. It is these small moments that show the humanity in all the characters. And finally, what makes it a legacy? Today everyone knows about The Lord of the Rings. Gandalf is the first thing someone imagines when they hear the word ""wizard"", in spite of there being a more popular book adaptation movie franchise which is literally about wizards. So many RPG games have their stories set in the manner of ""some characters with different abilities go out on a dangerous yet exotic adventure"". Elijah Wood has become world famous for his role as Frodo Baggins. Gollum, in spite of being the same annoying character found in all fantasy movies, is more popular than Jar Jar or Dobby. All of this is possible because of the way the story unfolds. Everyone who was evil was simply so because of the circumstances, and those who were good were because of how much the story emphasised on their actions. This coupled with great direction and a good world building made it so popular. The Lord of the Rings is one of the era defining movies of our times. It looks like a painting brought to life, one that we used to look at in fairy tales and nursery rhymes. It is the first thing that comes to someone's mind when they think of a fantasy adventure set in the medieval era. The patience of the creators and the fans is what made this trilogy so powerful. I really hope we get to see more such adaptations of books that we haven't heard about. This one has made a benchmark that will be hard to reach in the near future unless a miracle happens.",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - Movie Reviews
885,Big Mojo W,"Jun 09, 2021","Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is the best ending imaginable to this incredible trilogy. The characters continue to shine, most notably Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf and Aragorn in this movie. With the Battle of Helm's Deep won and Saruman dead, the stage is set for the final battle in this epic saga. Upon finding that Sauron plans to strike the city of Minas Tirith, the heart of Gondor, Gandalf and Pippin ride to the city only to find Denethor, a madman in control of the city who is totally unfit to be the Steward. Eventually, the forces of Gondor, Rohan, Eriador and Mordor all coincide at Minas Tirith for the largest and in my opinion, best battle not only in this saga, but in all of cinematic history. Every scene in this movie holds weight to it, it is my favourite in the trilogy and seeing Aragorn finally take his place becoming King of the Reunited Kingdom always brings a tear to my black heart. This movie, like every other in the trilogy is flawless and I will rewatch these movies until the day I die.",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - Movie Reviews
886,Will C,"Jun 06, 2021",(Extended edition) I've always found this the weakest of the trilogy and it is also by far the worst of the extended editions. This suffers much more than The Two Towers from pointless additional scenes that add nothing to the film other than to bog down an already exceptionally long runtime. There's very few additions that I think make the film any better.

I had certain expectations and I suppose Homecoming helped me know what to expect from its sequel. With that in mind I really had a good time with this film. Its a fun small neighborhood film with a really good villain. They nailed Mysterio in the film. I loved how they portrayed his character and I loved his costume. I was surprised just how close they got to the comics with it. I am glad the days of trying to subdue or gritt-ify superhero costumes are somewhat over (still holding out for Wolverine to get his comic book costume). Ideas of certain superheroes are kind of goofy and so are the costumes. It's part of the fun. Certainly adapt so it doesn't look super goofy but don't destroy either. Overall I would recommend giving it a watch. Holland still isn't my ideal Spiderman, nor is his world, but I enjoy it for what it is. And I am so glad they got rid of Spiderman's AI voice.

The humor is still good enough, the action is done well, and Holland continues to play his role marvelously.

901,Felix L,"Nov 16, 2021","I have a lot to say. I am a huge Spider Fan a Huge MCU fan. The number of people that know Peter Secret identity is Outrageously high so it doesn't feel like watching a spider man story. The Whole Teenage movie Recipe Cliché. The Character Dialogue try to copy the one from the early marvel Iron man movie.. and fail because they have nothing to say to each other. The Teacher is the best part of the movie. The pitch meeting for this movie should have been very differently .. You think Peter can go back to a normal life after the event of Infinity War.. I know marvel wants to Elongate the story but darn it felt wrong. You know from the beginning who Misterio is.. So nothing is a surprise .. Kinda dum that Sony want to make a Misterio movie since sooo long. He's really not an interesting character. At least he was well played. Again to many love scene and goofy scene. We will we ever have a spider man movie without love scene that never ends ..i rather watch a 45 minute movie that is good than 2h movie that just pointless boring story with multiple plot hole just to insert character that you really don't care about. Fake Fury team look like the Nebucad Nezar team from Matrix and they are super Cringe .. Movie is dull make no sense . Do you really think the Skrull can be this Dum. Its like if Peter did not learn anything from all his adventure in the past few years. He has 0 sense of responsibility . Homecoming was the best Spiderman movie.. why did it turn this way Why did Peter gave Edith to Misterio ,,, And the END with J Jonas Alex Jones Jameson is simply ridiculous it made me lost all interest in the continuity because we all know what comes next.. Just like in the Infinity Saga (2012-13) in the comics. that will keep going on with dr strange / Happy Plus Aunt may = Cringe I seem to be alone to think that this was a bad representation of who Peter Parker is. But i own 9000+ comic book and I'm not living in USA so what do i know This is my least favorite MCU movie and i am serious. I gave one star for acting and cast because it was a good cast . and another star for the score BGM and FX.

917,Rafael R,"Oct 30, 2021","Compared to this movie, Spider-Man: Homecoming is on another level. Far From Home is in general a decent film, but the two most important parts are bad-written: the protagonist and the villain. Tom Holland's Peter Parker involuted, becoming an idiot teenager who wants to run away from his responsibilities to conquer the girl he likes. Where is the guy who wants to prove himself? The guy who wants to be more than the neighbourhood friend? And Mysterio's plan and motivations don't make any sense. Luckily, he's imposing and Jake Gyllenhall is a stunning actor. The humour is more basic and less intelligent, but almost as efficient as Homecoming. And what elevates the level of this film is the third act, which is for sure one of the best acts in the whole MCU. The visual effects are amazing (by the way, the movie plays with them smartly) and the final fight is MCU's best individual fight (only one hero against the villain). Tom Holland and Zendaya's romance may seem forced, but it makes sense, they have chemistry and fortunately, the script kept MJ's cynical personality. No other character but Peter has been distorted.

979,Stefan Z,"Nov 11, 2021","Ah yes The Dark Knight one that turns into Home Alone. It's got a sprinkle of mission impossible too, but it's more known for being The Dark Knight that turns into Home Alone. All the The Dark Knight stuff are great. I am a huge Batman fan and absolutely hate Joker especially his oversaturation in the DC universe, but in this he actually works as the main villain. The score, directing, and cinematography are all fantastic. Deakins did unnecessarily use yellow more than need, but fantastic otherwise. It's when the film turns into Home Alone that I have trouble suspending my disbelief. Silva exposed all double-0 agents, but 007 because he was presumed dead, But MI6 have only 9 field agents? Where are the single-0s? If there were ever a time bond would NEED to work with someone else it would at the Skyfall property. Some snipers in the off distance trees, some in the house, another in the DB5 (that unfortunately was destroyed... again. I hate when movies think it's ok to destroy timeless cars). Some other times in other Bond movies I think ""maybe this would have been better with another double-0 by his side, perhaps not"". In this one I'm thinking ""bring in the cavalry"". Yes, I get it, they can't trust anyone especially how M's bodyguard of 15 years tried to kill her in Quantum of Solace, but then why trust Bond? He was presumed dead for how long, not know how much he's changed or feels betrayed still about her practically shooting him and doesn't know how much Silva's word affected him AND even acknowledges how little she knows if Bond is being influenced by Silva by abruptly feeling the need to stop and explain her actions involving Silva. I am also not really a fan of the film constantly asking the audience if the franchise is relevant, particularly M's scenes in the courts. Every single EON productions James Bond film, all 25 of them, have made money, even with new actors in the protagonist role where customers are not used to the new shoes yet, those sometimes make even more than the last one of the previous actor. Skyfall itself grossed over a billion dollars in 2012. So to answer the redundant question, yes, it's relevant. There also are some weird plot holes involving Silva. How exactly did he know the train was going to come through the wall when it did or how did he plan to kill M years in advance when the hearing was only set up 3 days beforehand. However, this and Casino Royale (2006) are the only Bond films where James gets character development, so that is a plus. I'm torn. Not a fan of those to particular writing things, the Home Alone part being a bigger deal for me really, but man, even though I spent like a sentence or two on the positives, they do really boost up the overall quality. The cold open, the fight against the sniper in the skyscraper, and the subway (tube) foot chase are some of the best action set pieces in Hollywood history. The tense gripping atmosphere of the mystery behind who is is hacking in MI6 before the villain is revealed is absolutely expert filmmaking. I do really think the positives outweigh the negatives here.",Skyfall,Skyfall - Movie Reviews

993,Nathan D,"Oct 10, 2021","Skyfall is an incredible movie with many astonishing aspects that make this film feel like a genuine spy thriller. Sam Mendes does a magnificent job directing this movie, as he creates this obscure yet exciting tone throughout the whole screen duration. The solid script helps support Mendes' vision with a prominent central story. Skyfall nailed down the story perfectly, as this is the first Daniel Craig Bond movie to feel like the world of a spy. Both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace struggled to capture the elements of a James Bond. However, the screenwriters perfected it here in this movie. Having the central storyline being an attack on MI6 while mixing in some of the personal elements of the characters is excellent for this franchise. Where the script falls flat was the misuse of the Bond girl. The poor treatment of Sévérine is very noticeable throughout the film and makes Skyfall suffer significantly. It is not necessarily wrong to not have a Bond girl, but to have one and completely butcher her character arc is wrong. Skyfall is visually stunning, with the exquisite cinematography stealing the spotlight at times. Roger Deakins does an extraordinary job here as the director of photography. Many shots were remarkable and captured the worldbuilding exquisitely. The editing is also the most potent of the first three installments. There are a few scenes with slightly choppy editing, but it is not as detrimental as the first two films. The score is also very compelling as it elevates a lot of the scenes. Thomas Newman knows how and when to make the music match sonically with what is on screen. The cast of Skyfall is strong, with a lot of great performances all around. Daniel Craig is smooth and has a lot of fun quips that make this movie special. While he may be exceptional in the role, his performance in Casino Royale edges his performance here just by a bit. Javier Bardem is phenomenal in this film and had the best performance out of everyone. The emotion Bardem put into creating Silva was comprehensive, and Bardem never overacts in any of his scenes. Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw are both prominent in their respective roles. They each stand out in all the sequences their characters are present in. Lastly, there is Judi Dench, who knocks it out of the park. It is Dench's most excellent performance in all the Bond films, as we really get to spend time with the character and not just see her tell people to eliminate the enemies. Dench still keeps that aspect alive in her performance, as it is an influential aspect of M's character arc. However, it never becomes too over-the-top. Skyfall is the complete embodiment of James Bond as the film holds every aspect a spy thriller needs to be a great film. The story is easy to follow yet has this slight complexity to it that still makes it shocking. The cast is perfect, with no bad actors bringing down the film. What does bring down the film is a messy subplot that looms its gloomy shadow over the film. If it were not for that terrible treatment of Sévérine, the film would have been perfect.

She was charming and fun. I loved them both in Knives Out. It appeared Craig was enjoying this segment as much as I. I personally don't think any Bond movie should end like this and I actually regretted watching this outing.

1005,Lequisha S,"Oct 05, 2021","The Dark Knight of the Craig Bond films. Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins offer by far the best cinematography for a Bond film. You like that shot of the burning city in 1917? They got you covered with Bond's family estate. You like that shot in Shang-Chi of them fighting against the backdrop of neon advertisement billboard? They got you covered. Like the meditative wide shots of the landscapes in 2049? Oh do they have you covered in Macau. Like Adele? Covered. This film challenges Bond in a way no other film has. He's weary, battered, and no longer as fit for superspy espionage as he was in his earlier years. But the one woman who has been a constant in his hectic life, his boss and surrogate mother figure, and the person who gave the ""take-the-shot"" order than made Bond end up in the drink, Judi Dench's M is at risk. The best bond villain to date, Javier Bardem's Anderson Silva, is not trying to take over the world. He's got a personal vendetta against the one person Bond has any real attachment to. What's more, he's a dark mirror to Bond. A former 00 and M's previous favorite, Silva was the Bond before Bond who also suffered from ""mother's"" decision to prioritize the mission over the agent. He's not only a formidable foe for Bond, but he's an effective foil. This is also the best fusion of the modern, gritty, grounded Bond and the gadget-laden, seductive, classy elements of early Bond. It pays homage to hallmarks of the olden days (Moneypenny, Q, etc.) yet breaks new ground (we visit Bond's home, we change M's, etc.) This is truly prestige bond.

Skyfall brings the stakes higher as everything seems to be collapsing hence the title. In here Daniel Craig continues to shine as James Bond and here is directly paired with Judy Dench as M as M16 is attacked by a powerful villain. The chemistry between the two is wonderful almost as a mother and son relationship and Craig faces his most challenging antagonist until this point Silva played by academy award winner and spanish actor Javier Bardem. Bardem kills this performance and brings a similar aurora to that he brought to No Country for Old Men. Bardem is psychotic, mild mannered, and out for revenge in one of his most iconic roles. Lots of great action here as always but is the drama between the characters and the great relationship between M and Bond that makes this movie so incredible to watch with a climax that keeps on the edge. With Adele singing in the intro, great direction by Mendez, a great script, and an incredible performance by Javier this movie is almost a masterpiece.",Skyfall,Skyfall - Movie Reviews

1020,Puroo R,"Aug 08, 2021","Looking at the poster and trailer of this movie I was thinking this might be something really good. I had recently watched the first three movies of this franchise and I really liked the whole concept of Transformers; just seeing them do something on the big screen is enough to get my attention. So when I heard that this is the worst movie of the franchise, the robot dinosaur poster refused to let me believe that. How can a movie with such a good CGI possibly be bad? And when I watched it... I now apologise to all those people I didn't trust. I'm really sorry. The problem with this movie is that it has humans. I know, Transformers are all about Autobots and humans interacting and coming together to beat Decepticons, but the humans in this movie are terrible. I forgave Dark of the Moon since it was Sam Witwicky, the same guy we had previously seen in two prequels. But this time, it's the new guy. I don't even remember his name, so let's just call him Mark Wahlberg. Mark is such a two dimensional character. He loves mechanical engineering and hates anyone approaching his daughter. Yes, that's his entire personality. So when Optimus Prime ends up coming to his lab, they bond together. The premise of this movie is all wrong. The Autobots are now considered criminal in this world because of the destruction that happened in the previous movie. Like, what? Dude, even the army was doing destruction in the previous movie if that's supposed to be a real reason. Also everyone saw the Autobots fight the Decepticons in the epic climax moment. And it's not like there's some communication gap between the Autobots and the humans, since Optimus Prime literally lived with the military. So if there's any problem at all, they can just talk about it. So anyway Optimus helps Mark, his daughter and her boyfriend escape from there, and they team up with Hound and some other Transformers (I don't even remember the names at this point, because they don't give a reason to do so). Together they go to The Lost World where Optimus fights the robot T-Rex for which I watched this movie in the first place. First of all, the T-Rex is like, five times bigger than Optimus Prime. For comparison, just try fighting an elephant with your bare hands (except that elephants are herbivores and won't attack you unprovoked). And after the beating that T-Rex becomes friends with Optimus because it's a Michael Bay movie. So then there's the epic showdown battle between Mark and some bad guys. I was doing my college project on my laptop and this movie was running on my phone's Prime Video, so I used to only look at the movie whenever something interesting would be happening, otherwise I'd just keep doing my work. I don't think I looked at the screen more than 3-4 times throughout the work. This is the reason why I can guarantee you that it's a boring movie. I don't remember most of it. Transformers: Age of Extinction is the movie that taught me that Transformers could be bad too. Earlier I used to see Screen Rant articles which said that after a time the movies went repetitive with the CGI fighting and explosions, so I didn't understand what's bad about it since that's literally what I watch them for. But it turns out the reason why I hate it is the other way round. The big, cool robots have now turned into parodies of themselves and the humans are no longer even close to being interesting. I'd say if you haven't begun watching this franchise, just watch the first three and then jump straight to Bumblebee. That would save a lot of time and inner peace.",Transformers: Age of Extinction,Transformers: Age of Extinction - Movie Reviews

The new Transformers are fun as well, whether it be the snarky Crosshairs, the serious Drift, or the violence loving Hound. This movie is a new start, and a good one at that.

The score once again is very amazing. It makes a good moment into a nearly perfect moment. The story is not complicated and if anything its too basic. The action like every Transformers movie is GREAT. It also is probably the most kid friendly Transformers movie out of all of them. This or TLK. The humans aside from Cade are pretty bland and just, ""Eh."" Lockdown is great though. He might be better than Megatron. He is very powerful and pretty cool looking. Some of the shots in this movie are insane. But another problem is how long this movie is. I feel like it could have been done in a one hour and forty five minutes movie. Like every other Transformers movie its pretty stupid. The dinobots were pretty cool. but they could have come sooner. Lockdowns ship is very cool. Crosshairs, Drift, and Hound are all ok additions to the cast. They kill off an important Transformer in the beginning which sucked. It helps show how powerful Lockdown is though. This movie is like a cake. You eat it and it tastes pretty good. You think to yourself that you would it the cake again in like half a year. You do and it tastes just as good.

1060,Jeff B,"Oct 29, 2021","Jeff Barnes 8/28/21 The Dark Knight Rises Review The Dark Knight Rises enables you to be absorbed while watching it with: symbolism advising you to pay attention, intrigue, a moral that teaches us persistence. Batman in The Dark Knight Rises plans to save Gotham City from a terrorist named Bane with the help of Catwoman. Catwoman is perhaps the most captivating character in the picture. Catwoman is a thief, but she believes she's being a thief for a good reason. She tells Bruce Wayne that she, like Robin Hood, steals from the rich to give to the poor. She is so full of mystery we wonder why does she feel like she must steal to get what she wants? I's probably because she enjoys being sneaky and manipulative. She does it because she sees a lot of fun in it. Catwoman believes you should take what you see because you only live once, and that you should seize the moment. Catwoman is an insecure woman who's not sure if she wants good or evil in the world. There is a scene in the film where Catwoman a/k/a Selina Kyle sees a picture of a family and realizes that the place that has been demolished and spoiled was someone's home, and her friend Holly says ""now it's everyone's home. This is what you wanted a storm is coming."" Selina then looks dismayed and unassured as if she seems to be comprehending that maybe evil isn't as pleasant as it seems. One of the most powerful moments in The Dark Knight Rises if not the most powerful moment is when there are an army of policeman running towards an army of criminals shooting at each other, and this represents a war between law and crime. The Dark Knight Rises like the previous Christopher Nolan Batman films has a main theme and it's persistence. The occasions that most notably represent persistence is when Bruce Wayne is thrown in exile when he's thrown into a pit where men suffer, and he's determined to get out. Wayne realizes that climbing out of the pit takes persistence because he figures out that only one person made it out. He also grasps that he and Batman have a whole lot of endurance as well more than you can imagine. He's still willing to climb out of the pit despite only one person having done it successfully. Before Wayne successfully climbs out of the hole, he sees Bats coming out of the walls and this symbolizes that he truly is Batman. The film that shows that Batman is willing to have so much persistence that he's willing to be selfless by risking his life to save others at the end. Christopher Nolan brings a satisfying conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy with: persistence, theme, morals, symbolism, and intrigue.",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews

1069,ggavwva a,"Sep 30, 2021","Sep 21, 2021 This review contains spoilers. the filmmaking in The Dark Knight Rises is nothing short of masterful, and stands above the other two in the franchise, especially from a cinematography, production design, and art direction standpoint. Not to say ‘Begins' and especially ‘Knight' were lacking, because they were crafted to astoundment, but ‘Rises' just took it a step further, especially with the sound, and the fact that it didn't get nominated for either sound mixing or editing is a straight up insult to the film, and goes to show The Academy was only concerned with the politics of the shooting that year rather than the merit of the actual film, which was fantastical. On a technical level, it's **** amazing. It deserved a cinematography, production design, SCORE, sound editing, and sound mixing, and visual effects nomination and there's no **** denying that. The production design and art direction were more layered and complex than the past few films. The cinematography did seem a bit more modest than ‘Knight"" but it still succeeded at giving us some haunting and memorable images and composition that really fit the more somber and hopeless tone of the film, instead of the fiery orange and blues that bolded the presence of chaos in ‘Knight"". The score may have taken track basis' from Begins, but it restated them and added much more variety and emotional power and timing to the film. The sound design isn't even an argument, and while the visual effects were actually pretty minimal for the part of a lot of them being practical, that still should've given it enough to grasp a nomination over ugly bland CGI **** like The Avengers and that Hunstman movie. I mean come **** on, those two movies have some of the ugliest color palettes and uninspired VFX I've ever seen. In a less competitive year, it easily could have gained a supporting actor nomination for Michael Caine, because he added a whole extra layer of emotional depth to the film with his performance, and boy he really got it out in those few scenes. it gave me a feeling I haven't really felt in any other movie, bringing tears to my eye. And no, he wasn't not in it enough. Check Hal Holbrook for Into the Wild. He was in that movie for a very short time, but gave enough of a performance to get a nomination. Same type of deal. With very similar roles, actually. Despite being the best, most relevant, and most well made film of the year, and even one of the best of the decade, Adapted Screenplay, Picture, and Director were extremely unfavorable for the simple fact that the Academy can't see past ""Batman"" and because it wasn't getting anything more than its predecessor did. I can go on and on and analyze all the relevant and subtle political themes and philosophical depth that is beautifully mixed in with honest and emotionally resonating heroism, postmodern ambivalence, and themes of pain, corruption, and personal crisis and struggle, but it's not that important to this topic. People are too busy nitpicking **** that doesn't even matter (and can easily be debunked) anyway. The fact of the matter to this question is that it was ungratefully and unreasonably snubbed from the technical categories simply for the fact of the Aurora shooting. There is no other answer. The Academy didn't want to glorify a film that ""represented"" such a tragedy. The Dark Knight Rises is one of the most gritty and beautiful films ever made, and from a technical standpoint, it is one of the absolute greatest next to its predecessor. It deserved at least 2 or 3 nominations for sure at the very least. **** the Academy for putting politics over actual filmmaking merit.

The movie is exemplary in its use of editing and sound, they complement each sequence in the film perfectly and set the atmosphere for the film. Tom Hardy is almost unrecognisable as Bane. I believe it was a great performance. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman is a complete scene stealer and the dynamic scenes between Christian Bale's Batman and her Catwoman are well done.

1075,Hhhh V,"Sep 01, 2021","Where to begin. It starts out with an absolute bang. Another movie to the trilogy, another extremely badass, villain of the century introduced. Bane is intimidating, ruthless, badass, a myth; everything a great villain should be: pure evil. We immediately are hooked to the story that continues unraveling through the next parts of the movie. We get to see yet another deep and dark interpretation of Bruce Wayne/The Batman. Once again, Christopher Nolan flawlessly executes the complexity of the character and gives us so much more than just that. We see Wayne using his fears, his pain, his suffering to overcome those very things and rise above. We see our beloved Alfred giving his all to what can only be described as his father-son relationship with Bruce. We see new characters appear for the first time, such as the talented burglar, Catwoman, who also gets a very deep character and personality behind the mask. We get to see a mere cop, who gives his city his all, and risks his very life for the great good, representing a symbol of pure goodness. Not a single moment throughout this movie that makes you feel bored or not entertained. It's filled with amazing CGI; next level story-telling; suspense to keep you at your toes; character development that makes you connect to them in a way you never have before. You can literally feel the pain Bruce is going through, you can literally feel his journey to overcoming it.

1077,Janjz Z,"Aug 29, 2021","Aug 21, 2021 i just rewatched this film for the first time in a few years and boy was it much better than i remembered. this film offers a new look at gotham compared to the dark, gritty criminal underworld present in the first two films. we can see a gotham that has prospered in the last few years, moving out of the darkness both figuratively and literally. most of the scenes in this movie are set in broad daylight, which is a refreshing change from the last two entries. tom hardy is excellent as Bane in this movie. he is the first villain in this series that truly feels like an unstoppable force. the moment where the whole plan comes together, the cops are trapped underground and bane declares anarchy on the football field was chilling and was the first time i felt as though there were real stakes from a villain. i do find miranda tate being the true villain an excellent twist. she is Bruce's reckoning, a cultivation of everything he has done and him quite literally facing his past dealings with the league of shadows and the consequences of his never ending work to protect gotham. i do wish they'd built up her relationship with bruce a bit more, though, as their romance did seem to come out of nowhere, but in the end it made the twist even more jaw dropping. this movie is long, and there is a LOT going on, but for the most part the pacing is pretty good. there were definitely parts that could've been cut out, this film suffers from agonisingly long and boring car chases like the dark knight does. other than that there isn't much i would change about this movie. anne hathaway is also spectacular in this movie and was very enjoyable to watch. i found myself enjoying every scene she was in and we get to see her grow from the selfish to the selfless across the movie. this movie also features great performances all round. out of the main ensemble i can't say there are any weak performances. my favourite scenes would have to be the ones of bruce in the pit. he is quite literally reborn there and the harrowing chants of the prisoners as someone attempts to climb is something that i always remembered from the first time i watched this movie. this movie excels at being the end of the trilogy - batman's final mission. with the highest stakes ever, and one of the most impressive villains i have ever seen in a superhero movie, it's an enjoyment to watch from start to finish. And in the final scene where we see the plane fly off with the bomb and batman inside it we are quite literally seeing the death of batman. bruce may still be alive but he has hung up the cape, and the batman died along with the bomb leaving a beautiful well-wrapped ending to one of the best trilogies of all time. i don't see much point making more batman movies after these ones, they are hard to flaw are greatly celebrated even today. afflecks batman wasnt great, but he still feels like he stands in the shadow of Bale, which i also worry will happen to Pattinson once ""The Batman"" releases. after rewatching the remarkable ending to a franchise it has got me thinking about how future movies can compete, and in my opinions batman should be left to rest for now. the dark knight rises is the perfect fulfilling ending to batman and his story",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews
1078,Vghh H,"Aug 26, 2021","Aug 21, 2021 Not only is this the most intelligent Nolan film, really getting you to work as you watch the villain's plan unfold before you and the heroes, but it is also the most powerful in storytelling and moving the audience. Already you have the groundwork laid out from the previous film 'The Dark Knight' to follow up with Batman, running from the police who now has to tackle a new threat. It could not be done in a more mind-shattering and brilliant way. Bane's character, while seemingly a bit generic, quickly makes you realize how much you've taken him for granted when learning more about his backstory. Every time he walks on the screen he has a presence. I would say the same for the Joker, but he's been unfortunately memed too much for me to take him 'so serious' anymore. The way in which Bruce must rise again from the pit truly felt inspiring, and how he climbed out without the rope, the safety which he had always throughout the previous films. To me, that rope was symbolic of everyone he had with him throughout the films. Alfred, Rachel, and Dent as well. Now he had lost them all to the very same symbol which he crawls back to every night. He still finds the courage to put it on one last time. This time especially, I felt extremely interested in all other subplots in the movie. Gone was the fun but slightly stale 2000s grain and the lower mm cameras. This really plays up the aesthetic which Gotham is, and also allows for Gotham City to feel breathed in, as though people are really walking through it. This is something I never truly feel in any other Batman series or adaptation. To say this is the best Batman movie is an understatement. This really is the peak of Nolan's filmmaking for me. Everything from the acting, choreography, the score, and much more is such a step up from both predecessors. It never ceases to amaze me how much effort must have gone into this film.

This is going to be like a combo of my review of the movie and just my general thoughts on the trilogy as a whole but in both regards it deserves nothing but the highest praise. Such a brilliant display of everything from audio-visual work to narrative structure and characterization this trilogy really does it all. The score was absolutely outstanding from beginning to end and in this movie I felt like the score did so much to amplify all of the scenes regardless of what was happening. The dialogue was amazing, iconic one liners and more subtle conversations that carry so much emotional weight it doesnt feel like a single line is wasted at any point which is extremely difficult to do. The cast is so well done, can we just talk about how this one trilogy has some of the best protagonists antagonists and side characters in all of fiction? Every character arc was explored and developed to its fullest from beginning to the end, characters that are introduced in one movie get the proper amount of development necessary to flesh out every aspect and ultimately creates some of the most iconic performances in all of media. This movie had that in spades, in particular it had a lot of really good development for Commissioner Gordon who was already one of my favorite characters in the trilogy but this cemented it for me. My favorite character in this movie in particular was Catwoman for sure, she served as a super interesting counterbalance for Batman acting as sort of a more self-serving out for herself version of him and god damn was it fun to watch. Amazing performance Anne Hathaway absolutely killed it, its honestly kinda nuts how well she fit the role imo. Bane was another really interesting character, had some great dialogue, and his characterization was really well done. I think one of the main themes of this trilogy is the idea of chaos and how it brings out the worst in people, and Bane is a fantastic device used to explore this idea. I think The Joker was the better device through which this was explored but like I think thats being a little bit unfair so its whatever, both are fantastic in their own rights. Also this ending might be one of the best most conclusive most satisfying endings to anything that I have ever watched or read, everything fit perfectly into place, I just wanted to see my boy Bruce happy and thats exactly what we got, the ending had me straight up crying it was so good. I came to become so invested in these characters over the course of these movies and it feels so good to see this trilogy end in such a beautiful way. This trilogy is absolutely goated in every way, shape and form, Christopher Nolan is a genius.,I'm not even mad that we didn't get any more it's absolutely perfect. Truly one of the best universes in all of media, I honestly don't even know what else to say other than the fact that its brilliant The Dark Knight Rises: 9.5/10 Goated, absolutely fucking goated. This is going to be like a combo of my review of the movie and just my general thoughts on the trilogy as a whole but in both regards it deserves nothing but the highest praise. Such a brilliant display of everything from audio-visual work to narrative structure and characterization this trilogy really does it all. The score was absolutely outstanding from beginning to end and in this movie I felt like the score did so much to amplify all of the scenes regardless of what was happening. The dialogue was amazing, iconic one liners and more subtle conversations that carry so much emotional weight it doesnt feel like a single line is wasted at any point which is extremely difficult to do. The cast is so well done, can we just talk about how this one trilogy has some of the best protagonists antagonists and side characters in all of fiction? Every character arc was explored and developed to its fullest from beginning to the end, characters that are introduced in one movie get the proper amount of development necessary to flesh out every aspect and ultimately creates some of the most iconic performances in all of media.

1083,Jim T,"Aug 18, 2021","There's a lot of good in this film still. But it has neither as strong of a plot as Batman Begins or the stupendous fun of the Dark Knight. The climax is well done, but leaves unanswered still the question of whether Gotham can truly be saved, undermining the final product. Batman rides off into the sunset, but it is unclear that he has actually changed the city much for good - it still appears that it is only the same small group of individuals in the city who care for the city's character - not what Bruce Wayne took the mantle of Batman to do. Sure, he beats the bad guys in this battle, but he leaves the war while it's still being fought.

1086,Vhbg H,"Aug 13, 2021","Aug 9, 2021 Now this is how you close off an epic trilogy successfully! The Dark Knight Rises is the third and concluding chapter to Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, and is what I consider to be, a grand fitting end to the Christian Bale Batman/Bruce Wayne story arc. Released in 2012 to tremendous box office and critical reception, The Dark Knight Rises managed to become the highest grossing Batman film of all time, surpassing the hefty financial gain of The Dark Knight (2008), and still bares that title to this day. The Dark Knight Rises also has a few criticisms drawn from fans and critics alike, despite its mainly universal appraisal. Luckily for me, I'm not one of these hateful naysayers that hold any vice against this film. Drawing inspiration from various Batman comics storylines, such as ""Knightfall,"" ""No Man's Land,"" and ""The Dark Knight Returns,"" The Dark Knight Rises manages to convey an engaging and effectively entertaining plot that's jampacked with numerous allusions, homages, colossal themes, and most importantly, a gratifying and emotionally powerful conclusion. Christopher Nolan really outdid himself with this production. Not only do we get a phenomenal plot, but we get phenomenal choreographed action sequences and intense visuals. The special effects alone are a treat to the eyes!! Christian Bale is remarkable in his final performance as Bruce Wayne, bringing us a battle-hardened, broken hero who must rise past his broken spirit (and broken physical limitations thanks to Bane and previous fights) in order to save Gotham City from total nuclear destruction. Familiar faces aiding him such as characters portrayed by Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman bring their A-game in their final roles also. Newcomer Joseph Gordon Levitt does great as cop John Blake. And Marion Cotillard delivers an alluring, mystifying dual-identity role as Miranda Tate/Talia Al Ghul. But it's fellow newcomers Tom Hardy and Anne Hathaway that really stand out. The Bane we get in this movie is a lot different than the remedial one we get in Batman And Robin (1997); this new one portrayed greatly by Tom Hardy feels almost ripped straight from the comic books: an intelligent mountain of a man, who poses as both a physical and intellectual threat to Batman. Behind Heath Ledgers groundbreaking performance of The Joker, he's my favorite Batman villain in Nolan's trilogy. Anne Hathaway portrays Selina Kyle/Catwoman, a professional cat burglar, grifter, and femme fatale who develops a relationship with Bruce Wayne/Batman. She manages to evoke the sense of who Catwoman really is, and does such a great performance, she rivals Michelle Pfeifer's take on the character in Tim Burton's Batman Returns (1992). Lest we forget the intricate and meticulously well-shot 70mm IMAX cinematography? Or Han Zimmer's delightfully haunting musical score? Or every sliver of a detail perfectly synchronised to make connection and reference to the entire trilogy as a whole? No, lest us not forget. I still choose The Dark Knight as my favorite of Nolan's brilliant Dark Knight Trilogy, as well as my favorite comic book adapted film of all time; but The Dark Knight Rises will blow you away regardless",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews

The symbolism of the ending ends the trilogy off perfectly.",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews
1089,Ghhh b,"Aug 09, 2021","The dark moral of a corrupt political climate that The Dark Knight Rises shows through Gotham's grief is really excellent when the perspective is put on the issue. With Bane's ever lasting commitment to pulling off pain in the city, and Miranda's morality with her revenge it sets off a never ending stream for the tone of the film to follow along. Then Bruce wanting to be his own nation ""per say"" and do it without the willingness of others around him. Focusing on the complexities of the film is what I loved during this rewatch. Half of the dark blend of Nolan's direction and the surrounding technicals are what send this film off another level. With each of his films he keeps that dark tone and hits a nerve on the edge of your seat with every picture he makes. With each shot he focuses his time on making it make sense and capturing the message and/or symbolism of the scene. I don't really talk about it that much because it never turned to conversation but honestly the greatest scene in this film is the Star Spangled Banner Scene. The symbolism of that is so impressive. Your honestly watching one of the most messed up scenes in the history of Cinema. By using that song in the angelic voice of that young child symboled the freedom Gotham felt, but we as an audience no good and well it's not. And the feel of the scene is so damn intense. I always notice that it's only the kid singing, noticing that nothing else is happening except the anthem of freedom being used as the last thing to be heard before that feeling of freedom is stripped away entirely. Bane then going on to say ""that's a lovely, lovely voice"" knowing good and well he's about to kill that symbol of freedom singing the anthem of freedom. After that scene the third act takes off and the film gets nothing but brilliant. The technical blend as well deals with the more explosive side of visual effects. They go so well with the film it's hard to take your eyes off. The character of Bane has to be the best part about this film. Not only is he so **** misused in other DC properties and gets his rightful spotlight, but Tom Hardy's ability to make such an evil character and use that flow of darkness that Bane is so viscously proves that Christopher Nolan can be a director to take risk, and that arc of doing all of this for Miranda was pretty much a great twist. And I'd just say I recognize the hate that Miranda gets for her twist of being the head mastermind and not Bane, but I honestly think that the writers so greatly used their minds to convincingly show why she was the one behind it. Overall, The Dark Knight Rises should go in the all time books, and be shown as a way to tell a unique perspective on political corruption.",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews
1090,Jsnna S,"Aug 05, 2021","The casting is still great. The gravitas of Oldman Caine and Freeman just add so much weight and levity to characters which could not have been anything special. Tom Hardy is excellent as Bane and I love the way they shoot scenes to make Hardy seem larger then he actually is. He is almost the representation of pure evil and is the definition of intimidating. His famous 'I will break you' line from Batman Knightfall in 1993 has lived on to one of my favourite comic series and I love the soft adaptation that it gets. Selina Kyle contributed to some of my development in this movie in the same way that Carrie Fisher as slave Leia contributed too many children's development. Marion Cotillard is good as Tate but probably the weakest actor as she gets really cheesy towards the end. It's ironic as she is one of the better actors as a whole but doesn't always bring it for this movie. The most underrated performance though comes at the hand of the main actor and Bale knocks it out of the park again. Probably his best performance in any of these movies. The action is easily the best in any of the Dark Knight trilogy. Its funny ironically however as it means that Catwoman has some of the best action. The jewel in the crown though is Batman vs Bane in the sewers which is so cool. Speaking of which this is one of those extremely quotable movies due to Bane. My favourite is easily 'oh you think darkness is your ally, but you merely adopted the dark. I was born in it Moulded by it, I didn't see the light until I was a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding'. This all combines to make one of my favourite scenes when Batman escapes the pit and as a detail I love the bats coming out just before he jumps. Very rich plot. Its my favourite type of plot as if you are barely focusing on it you still get everything that happens but if you really focus you pick up every minute detail and I love those sorts of plots so much. The cameos also really surprise me as I didn't expect Scarecrow to rock up the first time I watched it. It's also miraculously well directed. Nolans over the city shots alongside his practical work, work wonders to create a realistic but also extravagant movie. His cinematography is also fantastic. It also continues the trend in his films to sometimes not have a concrete ending and in my opinion that works better. 10/10 I have no faults.",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews

1095,haley W,4d ago,"The film, the Joker, is about Arthur Fleck. For a living, Arthur works as a clown who deals with mental illness. He lives in Gotham City with his elderly mother and must take care of her. Arthur is constantly mistreated by society which is present throughout the film. When his social worker tells him he won't be able to get his medication anymore because the government is shutting them down to save money, this creates a major impact on Author and other citizens in Gotham who deal with mental health problems. This film has caused controversy because some believe it could give people ideas of mass shootings. The movie did not motivate mass shootings. It also did very well in theaters and many people, even if they don't know anything about DC Comics, really enjoyed the film. The Joker also had a very successful box-office run and won awards. The twists and surprises in this movie make it worthwhile and will have the audience on the edge of their seats. The opening scene of the Joker sets a dark tone for the rest of the movie. It shows how society treats people like Arthur and makes the viewer feel bad for him. Joaquin Phoenix who plays Arthur, was an incredible choice for this role. Joaquin's movements, emotions, and laugh really made the viewers sympathize with him as well as really helped the Joker come to life. The card Arthur must give to those who are confused why he is laughing is significant. This was a great way to introduce Joker's iconic laugh to the audience and to the citizens of Gotham city. A significant action Arthur does in the beginning of the movie is using his fingers to make himself smile while in clown make up. The reason this is important is because he is putting on a mask to make it seem like he is happy but, on the inside, he is struggling. Later it shows Arthur in his apartment with all his medication he has to take which makes him feel like he is just going through the emotions. The first subway scene shows how Arthur is being picked on because of his mental illness by laughing in a serious situation. This causes Arthur to make a rash decision and causes an uprising. The director Todd Philips did an amazing job picking the cast members. Each scene was important to this story as it went on. The close ups and zoom-ins, like Arthur sitting on the train after getting told he will be on the Bill Murray show, show how important and make you focus on that detail. After, Arthur goes to the Arkham Asylum, one of the many important parts in the movie. In this scene Arthur realizes about his past and what his mother, Peggy, went through. This scene is also huge because mental illness is a big issue in society today and makes people realize how big of an impact it can have on people. When Arthur leaves the Arkham Asylum you begin to piece together the hallucination he had with his neighbor. This begins to make viewers question what parts were hallucinations and what parts were really happening? The music in that scene is a great choice. The soundtrack to the film all fits together and was picked very well. This film is also interesting because unlike most movies about the Joker he is always battling Batman. But in this it takes place before Batman is Batman. It gives an insight into why the Joker became a villain and shows at one point he was a member of society, following the rules of Gotham. Another scene that was created well was when Arthur starts to transform into the Joker, by dying his hair and putting on clown makeup. Another scene is when he is dancing down the staircase. This scene is powerful because he is in his suit, clown makeup, and green hair. The music for this scene pulls it all together, it was a great choice and his dancing to the music is perfect. This is also showing his transformation from Arthur into the Joker. The scene on the subway when everyone is wearing a joker mask is powerful. This helps Arthur escape from the police, and it shows people turning on the police as well. The riot in the subway helps the cause of Arthur. The slow motion of him walking away from the subway while police run into the subway shows how confident Arthur has become and how much more confident, he is becoming. When Arthur is being pulled out of the cop car by fellow rioters and is placed on the hood of the car is symbolic. This is symbolic because there are citizens of Gotham who believe Arthur is right about the way Gotham is being run, which ties into his later encounters with Bruce Wayne. When Arthur uses his own blood to put a smile on his face and the crowd cheers, is the point when Arthur is no longer in control and the Joker has now taken over. The song ‘That's Life' is a great fit for this movie, which is played a few times throughout. It represents how even though society has not been kind to Arthur or others like Author, he still persevered through it and is taking actions into his own hands. On a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the highest score, I would rate this movie a 10. This movie can relate to issues in society today and is a realistic portrayal, unlike a lot of villain movies. It was directed incredibly well, and each scene is important to understanding the character arc the main character goes through. It also brings up mental illness which is an incredibly big issue today. Although Arthur's mental illness is very extreme, it still sheds light on how impactful it is on people. The background music in all the scenes match perfectly with the characters' attitude and show the seriousness of each situation. This really helps show how Arthur transformed into Joker and even when he wasn't telling you still understood the emotions he was feeling. It also shows how little Gotham did for the poor and mentally ill citizens. Todd Philips did a great job with bringing his idea to life and making people empathize with Arthur Fleck.",Joker,Joker - Movie Reviews

إقتباس من جملة نطقها الجوكر على لسانه في فيلم The Dark Knight والتي تمزج بين الرغبة في الشعور بالشفقة تجاهه وبين تبرير أفعاله التدميرية في مدينة جوثام، أما شخصية أرثر المهرج والتي عرفت بأسم جوكر في النصف الثاني من فيلم Joker من تأليف وإخراج Todd Phillips كانت الكاشف الأول عن العالم الحقيقي للجوكر والمبرر المنطقي لخلق شخصيته في أي مكان وزمان مماثل إلى العالم الذي أجبر أرثر على محاولة العيش فيه طويلا مع والدته داخل مدينة جوثام، وذلك من خلال مشهد وراء الآخر وبسبب هذا البناء التراتبي للشخصية يمكن تفهم حالة السوداوية التي تم تحذير المُشاهد منها. فيلم لم يخلو من الجدل أحدث الفيلم ضجة قبل خروجه إلى النور بسبب العديد من الأسئلة ومنها من سيقوم بلعب دور الجوكر بدلا من الممثل ""هيث ليدجر""؟ إلى أن تم الكشف عن ذلك ومعرفة أسم الممثل وهو ""خواكين فينيكس Joaquin Phoenix"" تسبب هذا الأمر في دفع الجمهور إلى حالة من الإنتظار والترقب لما يمكن لخواكين تقديمه في مثل هذه الشخصية المعقدة خاصة وإنه ممثل له ثقل، ولكن لم تنتهي الأسئلة والحيرة عند هذا الحد وبدأت تساؤلات آخرى وهو تخص المخرج، فمخرج العمل تود فيليبس يعرف بإخراجه الأفلام الكوميدية ومنها على سبيل الأمر The Hangover بأجزاء الفيلم الثلاث وفيلم Due Date وبالطبع هم على النقيض من صورة الجوكر الدموية وطبيعة الشخصية المحفورة داخل ذاكرة المتفرج بسبب قراءة القصص المصورة ومشاهدة أفلام باتمان والجوكر، ومع ذلك لم تتوقف حالة الجدال والتخوف عند هذا الحد فعقب الإعلان الأول عنه قامت المباحث الفدرالية بتحذير جنودها FBI من حضور الفيلم لما أتسم به الإعلان من مشاهد دموية كما زعموا في تقاريرهم ، المثير في الأمر إنه بعد عرض الفيلم في مختلف دور العرض كانت ردود الأفعال شديدة الإنحياز بين محبي وكارهي الفيلم حيث لا وجود لحالة وسطية بينهم ؛ الحالة المنتشرة من الجدل هو أمر مفرح في حقيقة الأمر لأنه أبسط ما تستحقه شخصية ثرية وصعبة البناء مثل الجوكر. جوثام رحم خصب لخلق جوكر لم يسبق للمُشاهد معرفة الحياة الخاصة والنشأة الإجتماعية التي ترعرع فيها ""الجوكر"" حتى يصبح بمثل هذه العدوانية وعدم المنطقية، فكل ما سبق معرفته كان قشور سطحية عنه وعن الآذى الذي تعرض له في مدينة جوثام فقط، أما في فيلم ""جوكر Joker"" يستطيع المتفرج أن يشاهد الحياة السوداوية التي سعى آرثر للتعامل معها منذ اللحظات الآولى من الفيلم، أظهر المخرج فيليبس مدينة جوثام بأنها شوارع تفيض بالقمامة والقاذورات وذلك عن طريق حركة الكاميرا عند جانبي الشارع فضلا عن الإذاعة التي تخص أحوال البلدة بأنها مدينة ممتلئة بالقمامة والفئران، وفي هذه الأثناء كانت الألوان المستخدمة لتظهر البلدة هي ألوان غاية في السواد خافتة في إضاءتها تشعرنا بحالة من البؤس والحزن وليس الغضب والثورة، في هذه المدينة ايضا نجد حديث تلفزيوني تعمد فيه المرشح السياسي بإهانة الشعب عن طريق وصفهم بأنهم مجرد مهرجين، الصور السابقة سعت إلى تمهيد عالم ديستوبي تعمه الفوضى وهمي ليس للخير مكانا فيه حتى لا ينصدم المُشاهد من مشهد ما. تدور أحداث الفيلم حول شخصية آرثر، آرثر شاب يعمل كمهرج محدود الدخل والموهبة ايضا وسنعرف الأسباب فيما بعد، يتعرض إلى تعدي جسدي وضرب مبرح من قبل مراهقين بدون وجه حق، لكنه لم يحاول الدفاع عن نفسه وفضلا عن ذلك لم يقف الأمر عند هذا الحد بل تعرض للمضايقات والتنمر من قبل رئيسه وزملاؤه في العمل ماعدا زميله القزم، من خلال أحداث الفيلم نكتشف إصابة آرثر بمرض يدفعه إلى الضحك الهستيري المرضي الذي لا يتوقف، يبدأ آرثر في الضحك عندما يكون أمام مواقف تثير غضبه وسخريته ولكن بسبب تعارض ضحكاته مع الموقف عليه أن يستمر في جلساته العلاجية أملا في تحسن حالته. يعيش آرثر مع والدته المريضة في شقة بسيطة ومبنى متهالك ورغم كل ما سبق يبذل آرثر كل ما في وسعه من أجل سعادة والدته والعناية بها، وخلال هذه الأثناء يعطيه زميل له مسدس حتى يكون وسيلته في الدفاع عن نفسه في عالم يزداد فيه الجنون يوما بعد يوم ومع توالي الأحداث يلجأ آرثر إلى إستخدامه ولكن دون الشعور بالذنب تجاه القتلى وتتولى الخيبات أثناء أحداث الفيلم إلى أن تصبح حياته أكثر أهمية من موته الذي كان يتمناه. الشخصيات المهمشة في حياة آرثر الأمر اللافت إلى الإنتباه أن جميع شخصيات الفيلم هم شخصيات تستحق الرثاء والشفقة مع إختلاف تلك الدرجة فالسياسي نفسه يتم قتله أمام أسرته في نهاية الفيلم، النساء الذين ظهروا في حياة آرثر مهمشات في حقيقة الأمر فنجد ""والدته"" سيدة مسنة مريضة أرغمت آرثر على أن يكون لقبه هو Happy رغبة منها في أن يكون آرثر وسيلة لإضحكاك الآخرين لا لنفسه وهو الأمر الغير مفهوم فمن الطبيعي أن تسعى الأم إلى سعادة إبنها وليس إلى سعادة الآخرين عن طريق التضحية بإبنها لكن آرثر كان متقبل لرغباتها ولهذا سعى لأن يكون مهرج ولكنه بالطبع مهرج لا يضُحِك بسبب إفتقاره لمثل هذه الموهبة، خلال أحداث الفيلم ترسل الأم خطابات بصورة مستمرة إلى الرجل الذي سبقت أن عملت لديه وتظل طوال الفيلم في حالة إنتظار من أجل الحصول على رد وعن طريق الخطأ يقرأ آرثر الخطاب الآخير ليعلم أن والده هو هذا الرجل السياسي المرشح في الإنتخابات، حاول آرثر الوصول إليه ولكن عند مواجهته قام بنكر الأمر وتعنيفه مفجرا حقيقة مرض والدة آرثر العقلي ويخبره بمرض والدته العقلي وبالفعل يجد آرثر أوراق تثبت ذلك، يضع هنا المخرج المُشاهد في حيرة حقيقية ففي عالم مماثل إلى العالم الذي يعيش فيه آرثر يسهل تزييف الحقائق لأن جوثام مجتمع ديستوبي مشوه وملوث يغلب عليه الإنهيار المجتمعي والقمع السياسي مما يعطي إحتمالية زيف هذه الأوراق ولكن طريقة الحصول عليها تؤكد احتمالية صدقها، ولهذا لا توجد حقيقة مطلقة في هذا الفيلم، بل تكاد تكون الحقيقة هنا هو أنه لا يوجد حقيقة! التلاعب المتكرر في الفيلم بتنقله الدائم بين أكثر من رواية يفقد المتفرج القدرة على تصديق اي من الروايتين ولا يكون منه إلا أن يستمتع بمشاهدة الفيلم وهو قابل إلى تصديق جميع الروايات. التلاعب الآخر الذي ظهر بوضوح في الفيلم كان عن طريق شخصية ""الجارة"" وهي Single Mother تعمل على تربية ابنتها بمفردها دون اي وجود لرجل في حياتها، صاحبة بشرة سمراء ومن المسلمات في تاريخ العنصرية هو وجود أمرأة ليست متزوجة وسمراء في بلد أوروبية مما جعل وجودها في مثل هذه الهيئة الشكلية والوضع الإجتماعي هو تأكيد على التهميش الواقع عليها داخل مدينة جوثام، يحتك آرثر بها في المصعد وتنشأ بينهم علاقة رومانسية عذبة ومن خلالها تكون داعم حقيقي له والشخص الثاني بعد والدته الذي يثق في موهبته فنشاهدها مبتسمة أثناء سماعها إلى نكاته، ولكن طبيعة هذا الفيلم دائما ما تصدم المُشاهد فهي لا تعرفه! إذ فقد كانت كل المشاهد التي أتسمت بالعذوبة عبارة خيال ورغبة داخلية لدى آرثر تمنى العيش فيها، وهذا بالتحديد أمر مهم لمن يريد البحث حول دوافع الجوكر إلى القتل لأن معايشة الخيال وكأنه الواقع هو أكبر دليل على كونه شخصية مضطربة ذهنيا. كان آرثر يمتلك دوافع إنتحارية أخبر بها ""طبيبته"" بوضوح لكنها لم تلق لحديثه اي اهتمام فقد كانت تكتب له ورقة الأدوية المصرح له بتناولها والمدعومة ماليا، عندما أراد آرثر للمرة الآولي أن يتحدث بما يدور بداخله بكل صراحة إلى الطبيبة كان ردها عليه أن المجتمع لا يهتم به وبها فقد تم إيقاف التمويل لهم وسيكون على كل منهما أن يسعى في طريقه بعيدا عن الآخر، هذا الأمر الذي حدث بالفعل في عام 1981 عندما ألغى الرئيس الأميريكي رونالد ريغان قانون أنظمة الصحة العقلية لعام 1980 الذي أصدره جيمي كارتر، ما تسبب في دفع العديد من الأشخاص الذين كانوا تحت المظلة التأمينية إلى الشوارع وكأن هذا الخط الدرامي هو إسقاط وتعرية لحقيقة ما حدث قديما مما يؤكد إمكانية خلق جوكر في مثل هذه المجتمعات بسهولة. بسبب عدم وجود إشراف طبي كان من المنطقي أن تسوء حالة آرثر إلى حد الإنتحار ولكن طريقته في التعبير عن معاناته كانت في القتل والرقص والإبتسام والضحك الحقيقي لأول مرة، فعندما لجأ آرثر إلى القتل اختفت حالته المرضية التي تخص ضحكاته المضطربة اللاإرادية، وكأنها تأكيد على يقين آرثر من مقولة الفيلسوف جان بول سارتر ""الجحيم هو الآخرون"" فعن طريق القضاء عليهم تمكن من الرقص بخفة ورشاقة وأمتلك وجهة نظر في هذه الحياة. آرثر ولد طيبا لماذا لجأ آرثر إلى القتل؟ في جريمته الآولى التي لجأ فيها إلى المسدس كان لديه غرض نبيل من المضحك قول ذلك ولكنها الحقيقة، عندما شاهد آرثر مضايقة ثلاث شبان إلى فتاة داخل محطة المترو تصاعدت ضحكاته بسبب سخطه من الموقف وهنا حاولوا هم التعدي عليه، دافع عن نفسه للمرة الأولي فقتل أحدهم، كانت المرة الآولي التي يخشاه فيه أحد فقتل الثاني والثالث حينها بدأ الشعب يشيد بأفعاله ويرتدون أقنعة المهرج مثله أثناء قيامهم بالثورة، رد فعل أهالي مدينة جوثام كان التعرية الحقيقة لهذا المجتمع فجميع أفراده ليسوا سوى جوكر في إنتظار فرصة مناسبة للتكالب والثورة وإعمام الفوضى، المهمش ينتظر فرصة واحدة حقيقية من أجل إثبات نفسه حتى يعوض حالة اللامرئي الذي فرضها المجتمع عليه وهنا ليس من المنطقي أن نطلب منه أن يظهر بصورة أخلاقية بل على العكس كلما ظهر بصورة مشوهة كلما كان أوقع لطبيعته. لم يكن من الصعب الإقدام على تنفيد الجريمة الثانية وهي القتل بالوسادة، قتل آرثر والدته بسبب إكتشافه انها السبب الرئيسي في تدمير حياته بإصابته بهذا المرض المزمن من الضحك بسبب تعذيبها المميت له في صغره، آرثر لم يعش يوما واحدا سعيد في حياته، بطل تراجيدي في وضع مأساوي منذ نعومه أظافره يجبر المُشاهد على الشعور بالشفقة تجاهه ودعم عمليات العنف والقتل التي قام بها، ولهذا كانت جريمته الثالثة مرضية نفسيا للمُشاهد وهي تهشيمه رأس زميله في العمل الذى آتى إلى منزله لزيارته فهشم آرثر رأسه أمام صديقهم القزم ومما يؤكد أن قتله لمن حوله لم يكن إعتباطي وإنما لغرض إنتقامي لم يقتل القزم بل حاول طمأنته وفتح له باب الشقة حتى يذهب في سلام، وعملية القتل الآخيرة من نصيب مقدم البرامج موراي ""روبرت دي نيرو"" الذي كان يعتبره بؤرة الضوء والسعادة الوحيدة في مدينة جوثام حتى إنه كان يمهد نفسه لمقابلته ويتخيل الأمر أكثر من مرة ولكنه فوجئ بسخريته منه والحط من شأنه، فقتله هو الحل الرادع من أجل إسكات صوت الإعلام التلفزيوني المزيف فهو وجه آخر إلى السلطة التي لا تأبه بالشعب الحقيقي. جوكر وليس الجوكر كان قرار المخرج فيليبس عندما أخرج فيلم بهذا الشكل هو إغراق المُشاهد داخل عالم آرثر وليس عالم الجوكر مما جعل الفيلم منفصل ومختلف عن صورة الجوكر المخلدة في الذاكرة وفي نفس الوقت ساهم في خلق فرضية انها قد تكون الحياة الغامضة التي نشأ فيها الجوكر حتى يصل إإلى مرحلة ما قبل الوحشية الغير مبررة، والجوكر قد لا يكون آرثر بعينه بل هو كل شخص من أبناء بلدة جوثام الذي ذاق الفساد والتعفن داخلها، في هذا الفيلم نجد آرثر قد تحول إلى ""جوكر"" وليس ""الجوكر""، جوكر هو إسم قد تم إختياره بصورة عشوائية في النصف الأخير من الفيلم عندما سخر موراي من آرثر أمام المشاهدين ولم يكن يعلم اسمه فقدمه في فقرته بأسم ""جوكر"". كان الأسلوب الذي لجأ إليه آرثر عند القتل يزداد عدوانية شيئا فشيء كما ذكرت في الفقرة السابقة فمن طلق ناري إلى خنق بالوسائد إلى تهشيم رأس ثم القتل أمام جميع مشاهدي التلفاز، فقد أعترف آرثر وهو في ثوب شخصية الجوكر بقتله للثلاث شباب في برنامج موراي على الهواء مباشرة ولم يقف الأمر عند هذا الحد بل قتل المذيع نفسه الذي سخر منه، امتلك آرثر كل المقومات التي تجعل قتله تبرير منطقي فقد كانوا هم من تسببوا في الآذى الذي تعرض له فكما يقول جان جاك روسو ""الإنسان يولد طيبا، المجتمع يفسده""، لقد أفسد شعب جوثام آرثر وجوكر في نفس الوقت في السابق سخروا منه وتعمدوا تهميشه وعندما تحول إلى قاتل قاموا بتمجيده، وفي الحالتين فهو يستحق شفقة المُشاهد. منطق الجوكر في إتخاذ قراراته ليس بالضرورة ان يكون نفس المنطق لدى المُشاهد الذي يشاهد الفيلم عند إتخاذ نفس القرارات في حياته الواقعية، ولهذا كانت هناك مواقف هجومية تجاه الفيلم بأن البناء الدرامي له ضعيف وغير منطقي، في الحقيقة أن عدم منطقيته هو أحد أسباب أهميته، فالفيلم بأكمله يدور في الثمانيات عند مدينة وهمية تم إفتراضها في عالم القصص المصورة تسمى جوثام، اي انه لا ويوجد ملمس حقيقي لها على أرض الواقع رغم إشاراتها الواضحة والصريحة إلى تشابهها مع مدينة نيويورك ولهذا يكون توظيف أغنية That's Life للمغني Frank Sinatra أمر منطقي، فكل جملة داخل الأغنية تصف الحالة الشعورية لآرثر المحاصر طوال الوقت إلى أن تحول إلى رمز لدى سكان مدينة جوثام ليحقق بذلك هدفه البسيط من هذه الحياة وهو ألا يظل غير مرئي في أعين الجميع قائلا: ""أنا الآن موجود، بدأ الناس في ملاحظتي..""",Joker,Joker - Movie Reviews

There's some problems but eh. This film is what solidified this saga for me. At first the highest i rated one of the films was a 7.6 for ""Empire Strikes Back"". Granted, I was torn about my ratings from the get go, but this film is what really awakened my true feelings. Empire went from a 7.6, to a 7.9, and then after this film, an 8.7. This film barely beating it, at an 8.8/10. I mean, I know it might change later, just like it has been, but for now I feel confident enough about my ratings and reviews; which is a first, ever since I started this saga. The Star Wars Saga went from a good franchise, to being one of my fav universes/franchises in film history. It gripped the Force around me, and now I love it and the Force is with me.

1143,Chris F,"Nov 19, 2021","It's hard to even encapsulate my thoughts in words, because I'm not even sure what I witnessed. Like watching a person in a wheelchair topple down a flight of stairs, I want to do anything to help, and yet I can only sit back and watch aghast knowing that there's only suffering left. This is immensely sad it becomes comedic, in a deeply mournful way. It feels impossible to make a mockery of something with such a powerful legacy such as Star Wars. But Rise of Skywalker somehow exceeded all hopelessly low expectations to be an absolute travesty of filmmaking. I've heard that this was an attempt to reset from the mistakes made in The Last Jedi. And yet the entire runtime of the film is filled with MORE mistakes, nothing of which resolves or absolves the previous poor filmmaking, and all which only makes the situation worse than it already was. It's as if Abrams gave up before he began, attempting to juggle far more than he knew he could, dumping his entire juggling act on the floor, shrugging, and walking away even though he was paid to entertain. The first part of this film is exhausting. The nonsense jump-cutting from scene to scene at (quite literally) lightspeed is so disorienting. It was so hard to wrap my mind about even what the general plot or objectives were as it bounced between conversation and action spectacle. Only when Lando Calrissian makes an obligatory cameo that I was somehow drawn out of my drunken stupor, and realized that I was actually watching a beloved series near and dear to my heart. And then I saw that series so bastardized that it was hard not to sit back and mock the entire thing. Jedi ghosts have super powers! Rey also has healing superpowers, wowee! Is that Palpatine? What's he doing there? Look at all those sith in coliseums. Why are they there? Who knows! It's just nonsense. To think of all the controversy there was when the new trilogy was originally debuting, and the entire Star Wars canon had to be reset just to make it make sense; knowing this is where it all ended up, it's almost a joke that the lore needed to be reconstituted at all. This series stomps on everything you love and acts happy about it. And you're meant to feel joyful that everything you love has been destroyed, truly and completely. You're meant to like this.

JJ has to come back and try to fix this trilogy, an impossible task I'd say, and I'd be correct. This movie is a mess with MAJOR plotholes, and it seems like it satisfied the fans? I don't get that, maybe the positive reaction stems from the after-shock of having to watch Rian Johnson's attempt at butchering the whole franchise, but this movie seriously lacks the Star Wars charm, which George Lucas gave us with his film. The reason why The Force Awakens is held higher than the two later instalments into this sequel trilogy is because that movie has the Star Wars charm, and the nostalgic feeling and hype around watching Star Wars again got to us all. There is serious potential wasted in this sequel trilogy, JJ played it safe, Rian ruined everything, and this is the attempted clean-up... This is a sad attempt, Disney, maybe you should try to bring in a George Lucas or a Dave Filoni in a supervising role or something. Both of them know how to handle this franchise.

1196,Jacob R,"Jul 04, 2021","This is a movie, that even now I still can't really make my mind up about. Like, I enjoyed it, I'm giving it a positive review, but it's easily the weakest of the entire franchise, and I actually don't think it's that close. The biggest problem is that this isn't a ""Toy Story"" movie; it's a movie completely about Woody. Everything is around him, not the rest of the toys. Because it's the fourth film I guess they can do that, but imagine if like a seven year old went with his or her family to watch this movie. They'll like it, but are they going to remember characters like Jessie, Bullseye, and the rest of the gang like the other three films? No, they're just not. In the other three films it felt like the screen time for all the characters were perfectly balanced. In this movie, however, again, it's all about Woody. Another big thing is that the new characters are really either a hit or a miss for me. Like I love Duke Caboom, but not really that tiny officer toy thing. It's like the same thing that Toy Story 3 has, just more of a distraction, at least for me. Now, with all of that said, this is a really enjoyable movie to watch. Animation is great, I like the story enough, but what's not talked about is the setting. Putting this story in a carnival was such a smart idea, and it can lead to a lot of good ""action"" shots. So yeah, I'm recommending it, just don't expect the same impact the other films had. There was really only one scene that left a huge impact for me, and without going into spoilers, it involved Gabby Gabby, the villain. I would put on a lot more Pixar movies before this one, but I wouldn't mind taking this one out of the toy box every now and a then. Go to Disney+ and make you're own opinion on this probably ending of arguably the best animated franchise ever!",Toy Story 4,Toy Story 4 - Movie Reviews

1202,Jerry S,"Jun 15, 2021","Toy Story 4 was pretty good. The animation was top notch and the best out of all of them. The story on the other hand needed some work. I honestly think that this movie should've had a subtitle under it because this feels more like a Woody movie than a a stand alone Toy Story film. I have no problem with it being a Woody movie but the movie is called Toy Story. With this I did expect the story to be about Woody and the toys not just mostly Woody himself. Sure the new characters like Forky, Gabby Gabby, Ducky and Bunny, and Duke Kaboom were memorable and fun to watch it just would've been more entertaining with the other toys that are there. However despite the movie's flaws there's a lot that I enjoy in this one. I enjoy Woody and Bo Peep's relationship. I actually enjoyed the father figure between Woody and Forky and I also enjoyed Bonnie experiencing school for the first time. However my favorite thing about this movie is the ending. I just loved how this movie ended. I really like the idea of Woody doing what he wants for wants he really wants to be with Bo Peep and he finally gets to do that is just so satisfying. This brings so much character development from Woody and opens the door to so many possibilities to tell knew and interesting stories for the toys. So overall was Toy Story 4 perfect? No, but it does do a lot of interesting things to not only keep you engaged but to also make you feel satisfied. 9/10",Toy Story 4,Toy Story 4 - Movie Reviews

1231,Jacob R,"Jun 27, 2021","Man….did Pixar kick off this decade with a bang with another 5 out of 5 movie! The last couple of Pixar movies have been some of my personal favorites, with Cars more suiting as a guilty pleasure than anything else. However, I think Toy Story 3 is better than all of those films by a good bit. First, the story and plot. It's a prison break movie, which I'm already a sucker for. Combine that with the Already great storytelling of Pixar, and you have a chefs kiss for it! Next, the villain. Lotso is probably the best Pixar baddie since Syndrome. He has a great backstory, and for the majority of the film, he wins, which is kind of insane. Now, let's talk about the animation: it's perfect, not too much to talk about there. And the ending, OMG the ending! It's such a great way to end the movie. If I had to nic pic one thing, it's probably the plot line of making Buzz a space ranger again, that seemed a little lazy. But that means we got Spanish Buzz, the funniest part of the film, so it doesn't affect the quality of the movie at all. The question really is is this the best Toy Story film? To me at least, I like the second more, the sole reason being that I like the characters introduced in that one better than this one. Not to say the new characters are bad in anyway, but are they going to leave as big an impact as Jessie or Bullseye? Yeah, me neither. This is a great film, and a perfect way to end this franchise….too bad they made another one, but that's for another review.

I also like the idea of a prison break out of a summer camp. And I also really like how they keep on bringing memorable new characters. And the ending of the film does put you on the edge of your seat. However even though I like the ending of this movie I think it would've been better if it had a tighter good bye to Andy. I think it should've had a little bit more time to feel the emotion through Andy, Woody, and Buzz. But other than that I really enjoyed this movie.

Hamuru 8 parçaya ayırıp parçaların her birini güzelce yuvarlayın. Tezgahı ya da başka bir düz zemini bolca unlayarak hamurları tek tek açın. Tereyağını eritip hamurların üstlerine gezdirin. Hamurları dıştan içe doğru sararak rulolar yapın. Ruloları kendi etraflarında spiral olarak sarıp 10 dakika kadar dinlendirin. Dinlenen hamurları yeniden tabak büyüklüğünde açın. Tereyağını eritip içine suyu ve tuzu ekleyin. Yeniden donmaması için kısık ateşte bekletin. Hamurların her iki tarafını da yapışmaz tavada iyice pişirdikten sonra üzerine yağlı sudan sürün.

Once again the performances are great, and the characters are as great as they were in the first. However this time around, we get introduced to an even more compelling villain than Barbossa from the first film: Davy Jones. Davy Jones is the best villain the ""Pirates"" franchise has to offer. Besides Jones, another aspect of this film that I think puts it above the first is the plot.

On the complete off chance, someone stumbles upon this review who has yet to watch the movie (that's got to be one niche market haha), it's fun, action-packed, has literally the best CG villain of all time, and actually an ok plot. Honestly don't get the hate for number two, it's still got a lot of the good qualities of POTC and hasn't yet gone threes route of being a bit ott and down right messy righting wise. Zimmer's new additions to the score are also very welcome, Klaus did a fantastic job with the first movie, but honestly I think he'd gone as far as he could with creating an incredibly iconic theme. Needed Zimmers expert touch to do the more subtle love themes and breath more life than solely reusing the same old main theme again and again.

Like the first movie, the visuals, music, costume, makeup and set designs are incredibly impressive, the acting is just as good, the film is honestly funnier than the first, it's a much darker movie, the characters are just as great and have clear motivations and once again, we get amazing pirate action scenes especially with the Kraken, the Will vs Norrington vs Jack fight and I love the ending where Sparrow comes back to ‘defeat' the Kraken. Seeing Will's father was also heartwarming and Davy Jones is a great villain and is built to be an intimidating threat but it's flawed. The tribe scene (whilst hillarious) adds nothing to the plot, Beckett does nothing throughout the movie but sit in an office and I just don't find the plot as intriguing as the first movie. It's basically a treasure hunt story without the obstacles. It seems more focused on characters than telling a fun story and because the story isn't over yet, it's also not entirely satisfying but it's still a good movie but the first movie was way better.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest - Movie Reviews

This movie has the best fight scene out of all the pirates' movies. It is well choreographed and worth its 2 hour run time.

To be real, there's never gonna be a Lion King rendition that's gonna come anywhere close to the 1994 classic, let's be honest with ourselves. However for it's credit, this remake did not want to make me leave the theater in disgust. If anything it's a good movie that it's worth a watch, you just gotta dial down your expectations of the movie because some parts of it are kinda watered down and a bit of filler moments are put in there too which would explain this movie being 25 minutes longer than the original. Other than that, it does follow the script to the letter and makes for a good nostalgia high with modernized graphics. Props to the CGI team, this movie does look beautiful, probably the highest mark of the movie. It's not a bad Disney movie at all, the unfortunate part is that it does not surpass what the animated classic has already brought out to us and those are shoes that are almost impossible to fill so I can understand this movie falling short in some parts. It does make for a good comparison of what is being brought to this generation versus what my generation got as a kid growing up in the 90's.",The Lion King,The Lion King - Movie Reviews

While it's a shame that director/producer Jon Favreau added nothing new to this tale (despite proving his capabilities with 2016's vivid and fresh 'The Jungle Book') it manages to retain the soul of the original and is sufficiently entertaining. Excellent voice and vocal performances couple with stunningly life-like depictions of wild Africa and it's animal inhabitants to satisfy fans hoping to relive an old favorite, while offering new viewers an experience approximate to what the rest of us experienced in 1994, albeit with less facially emotive animals.",The Lion King,The Lion King - Movie Reviews

The CGI is the best in any ""Star Wars"" films, and the entire story feels darker though still very welcome. The action is also done very well in this, and the worldbuilding is still very spectacular. About the only bad thing I can really think about this film is that there is quite a number of instances of fan service, though I think that this film handles it better than most other films do. Jones, Luna, Mendelsohn, Yen, and Tudyk are some of the better actors that really give it their all in this film. The humor is also very well and lands a majority of the time.

1350,Yuri L,"Sep 18, 2021","One of the best Star Wars films ever made, and certainly the best one made during Disney's ownership of Lucasfilm. This movie took a risk by dispensing with the orthodox Star Wars formula by not being focused on the Skywalkers, and instead introducing a new set of main characters who all died at the end. The risk paid off. A change in pace from the normal style of Star Wars films worked well. It was nice to watch a Star Wars film without countless scenes about the force and pompous Jedi preaching. Instead we had an intertaining action film which expanded the lore of the Star Wars universe in an interesting and exciting way. The final Battle of Scarif was very well executed, with an epic space battle and a satisfying and unorthodox ending. My only issue with this film is the character of Cassian who was supposed to evoke some sort of false-equivalency between the empire and the rebellion with his stories of committing unforgivable war crimes for the rebellion. This might be a good point regarding conflicts in the real world, and it might have worked in Star Wars but it was awkwardly executed and unbelievable considering the very black and white perspective we get on good and evil in other Star Wars films.",Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,Rogue One: A Star Wars Story - Movie Reviews

I thought all the lead actors played their parts well especially Felicity Jones as Jyn Erso. I think the visuals of this form are more artistically beautiful than the Lucas films - maybe that's the strength of Disney. I also found the plot more convincing. With the original trilogy the main stars always manage to miraculously survive but in such a conflict that wouldn't generally happen. Also the discussion of the morality of war and conflict in the rebel alliance added to the more realistic feel of this film.

All of the musical numbers were done to perfection, as well as the new songs included in the film. The animation looked great, even making a big blue Genie look like he belongs in our world. The only major gripe I have with this movie is the actor who played Jafar was nowhere near as harsh and menacing as the character was in the original.

They also tried WAY too hard to be empowering to women... to the extent they got rid of anything that seemed over-objectifying and gave Jasmine a new song and other quirks that come off as offensive to people in the middle east who have gender roles as a cultural norm.

The big problem with this movie is it banks on the audience connecting and caring about what happens to all of these new characters which just isn't the case. In fact the only familiar faces&people the audience cares about were Barbossa and Jack which are still great characters and all but there was none of the buildup like in Pirates 2&3. Because by the end of the movie nothing has happen except that a few new characters that we barely got an introduction to died which has no relevance to the series. That aside however there were some great scenes with Capt. Jack and Barbossa the palace scene for example and in all is certainly not as bad of a film as Pirates 5. So in all I would say a solid 7/10 film!",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides - Movie Reviews

1440,Daniel F,"Sep 11, 2020","LIKED: As Always, Hans Zimmer's Score is Fantastic and Ian McShane gives an Excellent performance as Blackbeard. It's also a very funny movie. DISLIKED: This is easily my least Favourite POTC Movie as it's missing something without Kiera Knightley and Orlando Bloom. there's not as much action and it gets very boring when they go on the Trek to collect the Challices and to the fountain. Barbossa also seemed pointless to bring into this movie as he didn't really have much to do.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides - Movie Reviews
1441,Thomas J,"Sep 09, 2020","This is the worst Pirates movie. While Jack is still fun and witty, the rest of the movie isn't. The villain is uncreative and unintimidating. The bootleg versions of Elizabeth and Will are so boring I found myself groaning with annoyance when they came onscreen. There is far too much action, and even the score is mediocre. Would not watch, skip straight to number 5 (which is ok in my opinion.)",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides - Movie Reviews

1447,Matthew D,"Jul 10, 2020","A return to form for this piracy centered franchise. Rob Marshall breathes life into a dead series with his swashbuckling adventure picture Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011). Borrowing heavily from the previous installments and Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade, Marshall takes us on a curious sea voyage seeking The Fountain of Youth and eternal life. Gore Verbinski's original Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy was much darker and more distinct, but Rob Marshall makes pretty well made films with a sleekness that's comforting. Johnny Depp is hilarious as the bumbling Captain Jack Sparrow, who improvises his way to victory with some clever wordplay and devious cunning. Geoffrey Rush's Captain Hector Barbossa is still fiercely entertaining with a raging vengeance sailing him towards Blackbeard. The gorgeous Penélope Cruz is cool as a sword fighting love interest for Sparrow as the voluptuous and vexing Angelica Teach. She's a wonderful addition to On Stranger Tides and adds a formidable foil element to bounce comedy, romance, and swashbuckling off of Sparrow. Ian McShane has a gravitas as Blackbeard, but I wish he got more screen time. If his crew were not focused on so much, he could have fought and killed more as Blackbeard to make him more intimidating and scary into the dread pirate Blackbeard. Kevin McNally is still steadfast and funny as first mate Joshamee Gibbs. Sam Claflin is nice and charming as priest Philip Swift. His romantic affair with the enchanting French mermaid, played by the hauntingly lovely Astrid Bergès-Frisbey, is a nice side plot for On Stranger Tides. Richard Griffiths has a hilarious cameo as King George II. Keith Richards kills it again as Jack's father Captain Teague Sparrow. He's mysterious and entertaining, while providing a serious presence in his scenes. Dame Judi Dench gets a funny quick cameo as High Society Lady. Marshall knows how to direct interesting action sequences like the double duel or the mermaid encounter with intricate timing. Marshall is also competent at directing sincere drama, but he leans too heavily here into the hectic near improvised humor. I wanted more romance drama between Captain Jack Sparrow and Angelica as well as more character development for Blackbeard. Marshall's direction is engaging and slick enough to keep me easily entertained by On Stranger Tides' 136 minutes. It's more compact than previous movies with David Brenner and Wyatt Smith's editing is more forward thinking and efficient than the bloated jump cut riddled At World's End. Hans Zimmer returns to cascade us with epic classical music for his Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides score. Heavy strings and intense percussion mark his sonic style with beautiful compositions throughout On Stranger Tides. Penny Rose's period costumes continue to amaze me with realistic pirate outfits down to the floppy hats and boots. Ve Neill's make-up is still excellent as I still like his use of black eye liner and dirty looks for all the pirates. It's not perfect with Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio rely too much on past in jokes instead of new bits, plus Blackbeard's crew being zombies is dumb and has essentially already been done in The Curse of the Black Pearl. Elliott and Rossio create a mysterious atmosphere with their intriguing writing with plenty of fun humor and lighthearted action. Dariusz Wolski's cinematography features heavenly fountain wide shots to intense mermaids attacking from dark waters with striking shots. Wolski is a creative cinematography with a stalwart style for Pirates of the Caribbean. In conclusion, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a refreshing splash of cold water to the face after the wayward and bloated At World's End.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides - Movie Reviews

The adventure was lame, overpowering Blackbeard was dumb and overall not really a good movie.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides - Movie Reviews
