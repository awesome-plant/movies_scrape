0,Ben W,6h ago,The best movie of all time,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
1,Aidan B,3d ago,"It provides groundbreaking CGI and is a well-acted film, however, the extremely generic story and mediocre plot end up bogging this film down. I think Cameron does a good job in directing this film, and the idea and worldbuilding was very well, however, the execution is poor as it just feels way more generic than it should have been. The acting is well though, and the CGI is phenomenal. There were also several plot holes, though I do hold hope that the planned sequel does expand well upon this film and better explains a lot of the things that occur. Overall, an entertaining film, just not one of Cameron's best works due to its lacking story.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
2,Rob T,"Nov 11, 2021","I didn't watch this in 3D but I did watch this on a big screen (not some 65"" TV) so I admit the visuals are quality but I'm guessing the 3D adds a lot more to the visuals. The story itself is unique, though there are some occasional scratch-your-head moments. I may be in the minority but it felt a bit weird to root for the romantic inter-species relationship. Still, overall a fairly decent piece of entertainment.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
3,Jon S,"Nov 10, 2021","Spectacular 3D visuals. Everything else (plot, character, dialogue, acting, pacing) was middling to bad.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
4,Michael P,"Oct 24, 2021","Unfortunately, this movie just hasn't aged well over the years. While the visuals are stunning (Pandora's flora and fauna) where built really well, great lighting, great photography work and the human portion of the dialogue isn't bad either, I just can't get past two big things in this movie a) the dialogue of the Na'vi - I mean, that is the best they could come up with? and b) the story arc - the movie is basically a mashup of Dances w/ Wolves, FernGully, and Pocahontas. Sure it isn't a complete 1 for 1, but for someone who had a lot of time to work on the story line, this is the best James C could come up with? (Dances w/ Wolves in Outer Space?) The technological concepts are good, but the story overtime, it just gets worse everytime I watch it. I cringe when I hear the Na'vi rally cry, its just culturally...well, insensitive. In this regard, the Na'vi language isn't original...of course, its a unique language completely made up (Frommer took inspiration from the Maori language)....and I guess that is my problem here. The vocal range is human, the language is based off a human language, the pitch and frequency of the spoken language is human. It just doesn't make a lot of sense...think about it, we share 98.8% of our DNA with chimpanzees, 70% of our DNA with zebrafish, and 60% of our DNA with bananas, and we sound NOTHING ALIKE! ;-) We travel to another fictional part of the universe and the Na'vi just happen to sound like one of our Polynesian languages hear on earth? If they are in the process of are being unoriginal, they could have at least given the Na'vi a proper Haka War Cry.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
5,Shane B,"Oct 20, 2021","When you take away the CGI and 3D effects, the movie itself isn't great. Go to a planetarium, you'll save some time. Dud!",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
6,Andrew M,"Oct 08, 2021","The world of Avatar is absolutely stunning. The visuals are remarkable, The Na'vi culture is very rich and Zoe Saldana does an amazing job in this film. A lot of hard work was put into this movie and it shows.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
7,Robb D,"Sep 09, 2021","What Avatar lacks in originality, it easily makes up for with stunning visuals and some amazing action. Cameron is a genius with a camera and his mastery is on full display to anyone who can view this beautiful film in the best HD resolution possible. 9/10",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
8,Eric P,"Aug 28, 2021",Here is a film that is truly amazing! The visual effects in this were one of a kind that were special and effective. The music and the scenes in Avatar gave me emotional feelings where I almost teared up. The action sequences in this film are amazing as well. One could argue that this movie is just Dances with Wolves knock-off with a hint of science fiction but the positives outweigh the negatives. James Cameron did a very phenomenal job directing this film.,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
9,Jordan H,"Aug 24, 2021",Cookie cutter plot. Saw it for the novelty of new 3D in 2009. No need to ever watch it again.,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews

16,Robert P,"Jul 23, 2021","The most expensive film to make, and currently it holds the biggest gross returns in history, I can only say this is the ultimate sci-fi adventure you can see to date!",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
17,"Jul 18, 2021","Probably the best Disney movie I've ever seen, ahead of it's time, watched it in theaters back then with 3d glasses and it blew any 3d movie out the water",FLAG THIS REVIEW,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
18,Dean S,"Jul 17, 2021",Saw in the movies in 3D so that was fun. But the story itself was pretty cheesy. I'm glad James Cameron stopped this nonsense and is now focusing on the epic story of Alita the Battle Angel.,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
19,Joe D,"Jul 11, 2021","To me this is the most perfect blockbuster of all. Love Sam Worthington's empty cup, I find his everyman acting compelling, Saldana may be the most beautiful woman on the planet with her trademark perfect posture, and Sigourney adds class with extra to spare wherever she goes. The planet Pandora remains the real star, and the revelation that we're the bad guys and the spiritual tree-huggers were right all along, I find genuinely touching every time. First class and I can't wait for more of Cameron's magic touch.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
20,Jimmy W,"Jul 10, 2021","The fact that this movie can make the most money of all time and also gain a following of hive-minded morons to defend it says more about the state of society than it does the movie itself. For a movie that's meant to make a point about abusive use of the environment, they sure seem to indulge in the use of massive amounts of expensive technology that no doubt utilized way more than its fair share of natural resources. Oh well, at least you can pretend to be vindicated by the box office numbers.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
21,Goudkuil E,"Jun 29, 2021","Apart from the visuals everything feels uninspired and thrown together using a old cliche of an outsider seeing what's wrong with what he's people have been doing falling in love then whiching sides. The acting is ok, the dialogue is kinda rough. The movie is padded with a lot of nice scenique views with no real narrative meaning.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
22,Antonio D,"Jun 15, 2021","o filme possui uma fotografia muito bela e, mesmo o filme sendo de 2009 não conseguimos encontrar defeitos em relação a montagem e fotografia, a história é satisfatória e é um reflexo do que sabemos que aconteceu no inicio da colonização",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
23,Tyler W,"Jun 11, 2021","The visuals were revolutionary for the time. But story matters and to the extent this film had a plot, it was borrowed from FernGully and Dances with Wolves.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
24,Noah H,"Jun 08, 2021","Great film through and through. The plot is excellent and engaging, and the character development is of a very high standard. Although it is a very long film, every scene adds to the atmosphere. Definitely worth watching - you won't regret it!",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
25,Erick F,"May 28, 2021","Filme perfeito. Edição, imagens, efeitos, narrativa, roteiro, atuações, planos de sequências. Incrivelmente extraordinário, te transporta para a incrível realidade de Pandora, e faz você de lá nunca mais querer voltar. Película completamente por múltiplas razões.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
26,Nathan t,"May 28, 2021","Avatar is an American science fiction film, directed by James Cameron and released in 2009. In this film we can find many guess like Sam Worthington or Sigourney Weaver. They portray Jake Sully and Dr. Grace Augustine. The main character Jake Sully try to understand how does a new specie live in Pandora. The film is about the probably future of humanity. The humans have deleted all the ressources of the earth, so they try to visit others planets for maybe find minerals. During this film we are on Pandora, a moon of a new planet. Human species can live in the Pandora's atmosphere, but scientist found a possibility to go discover all the planet. Take control of humanoids who live in Pandora. So we follow Jake Sully and Dr. Grace Augustin who will try to make contact with Eywa the chief of this new population. When I watched this movie for the first time the plot convinced me, because it is unpredictable and highly absorbing. There are many unexpected during all the movie. I must talk to you about the special effects. This movie is, for me, the most staggering film of the last 10 years. All jungle and humanoids made with special effects, the colors and the mood are very special. Each flowers or trees are detailed. It is perfectly stunning. The photography also is breathtaking, colors enable to convince all the viewers. There different cinematography techniques which give a beautiful introduction and transitions during the movie. Actors, portrayed, a human character but also a humanoid character, they must keep the same attitude and the same mouvements when they represented creatures. Each actor is natural and it's likeable to see. To sum up, I can say that this movie must be watch by everybody. With all work to make the special effects and the script, this movie seem prefect.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews
27,Jasper S,"May 27, 2021","De wereld van avatar roept bij mij vooral emoties van verwondering op. De wereld is zo wonder schoon en goed uitgewerkt. Je kan de hele film 2 keer kijken 1 keer voor de film zelf en de tweede keer voor de visuals. Het best voor deze film is om hem in de bioscoop te bekijken. Daar in die donkere bioscoop waar niks uitmaakt behalve de film worden bijna alle zintuigen geprikkeld. De dolby atmos surround sound zorgt ervoor dat jou oren alles meekrijgen wat er om jou heen gebeurt. Van het kogelschot rechts voor naar het fluitende vogeltje links achter. Het grote doek zorgt ervoor data jou hele gezicht veld word opgenomen door deze adem benemende film. Je voelt misschien niks fysiek op je huid neerkomen maar als jij kippenvel krijgt van de film merk jij dat heus. Het jammere is dat je de film niet kan ruiken of proeven wat zou dat een beleving zijn. Dan zou er bijna geen verschil meer zitten tussen film en realiteit. Deze wereld bevind zich in het universum met de aarde. De wereld zelf bevind zich echter op een andere planeet binnen dit universum. De wereld lijkt erg op de aarde met het aantal gewassen die overal staan alleen is alles een stuk groter. James Cameron is de regisseur en schrijver van de film. Dus de wereld is in zijn hoofd gemaakt. De mensen die de wereld daadwerkelijk gemaakt hebben zoals jij het in de bioscoop mag zien is gemaakt door een groep van meer dan 1000 mensen een gigantische computer server en een groot budget. Filmen begon in april 2007. Dat betekent natuurlijk niet dat deze film toen al af was want hij was pas in december 2009 te zien in de bioscopen. Avatar is een box office film gedirigeerd en geschreven door James Cameron die zich afspeelt op een andere planeet. De boodschap van avatar is dat je zuinig moet zijn op je grondstoffen. En je zuinig moet zijn op de planeet waarop je woont. De doelgroep van Avatar is iedereen die van films houd vooral van een beetje science fiction. Er zit niet perse een leeftijd grens aan de film je moet alleen wel 13 zijn om de film te kunnen zien. Het verhaal van de wereld is dat de aarde niet meer goed bewoonbaar is en de mensen van de aarde naar een andere planeet gaan om daar grondstoffen te verkrijgen om rijk te worden. De hoofdrolspeler is een man die geen functionaliteit meer heeft in zijn benen en naar de planeet komt voor onderzoek. Hij gaat zichzelf over zetten in een lichaam van de inboorlingen waarin hij ook weer kan lopen. Het conflict van het verhaal is tussen mens/machine en inboorling/natuur. De inboorlingen houden namelijk van hun wereld en behandelen de wereld met de respect dat die nodig heeft en de mensen komen alles kapot maken. De hoofdrol speler zorgt ervoor dat er een connectie gelegd word tussen mens en inboorling maar stapt uiteindelijk over naar de kant van de inboorlingen om hun te helpen mens te verslaan. De characters Bestaan uit mensen, mensen in machines, Na'vi (inboorling), en meerdere dieren. In de wereld waar de mensen komen is alles een stuk groter dus de mensen maken exoskeletons om een kans te hebben. De Na'vi aan de andere kant zijn zo in toon met de natuur dat is een vlecht hebben waarmee ze een band kunnen maken met dieren. De sferen die in het verhaal komen zijn heel wissel valig door de film heen. In het begin is het vooral leuk dat je alles kan ontdekken en sta je achter de mensen. Als de hoofdpersoon met zijn lichaam van een na'vi het kamp van de na'vi binnen komt is er vooral liefde. Daarna sta je achter de na'vi en is er vooral verdriet over de destructie van de mensen. Maar op het eind is het euforie door de overwinning van de na'vi. Een hele achtbaan aan sferen dus De film word foto realistisch vorm gegeven op een 2d doek. Ook 3d als je de bioscoop extra betaald en je een bril opdoet. Het thema van de wereld is natuur en duurzaamheid.",Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews

36,"Apr 27, 2021","The main film of the year 2009 is «Avatar» by James Cameron, the producer of such films as «Terminator», «Titanic», «The Strangers». This film ranks with above-mentioned world-famous films and probably belongs to the science-fiction genre. The action of the film is set on the planet Pandora in the year of 3000. The plot is rather simple: the super hero Avatar is to save the alien planet and to fulfill this mission he struggles with a lot of difficulties. The main character, Jack Sally, is a disabled navy who has just come back from the war. The film starts with the scene when he is invited to take part in a secret expedition to the planet, inhabited by weird creatures. Thus, he becomes the part of the programme called Avatar. Being turned into a a three-metre giant with blue skin, he is sent to the planet with the help of special «drivers» that link his mind to the mind of Avatar. What impressed me most is the spectacular world of aliens that we, the audience, see through the eyes of the main character. The special effects and 3D technologies enhance the impression of the bright and colourful world in contrast to the human one, which is grey and dying. The plot of the film is fast-moving with some amusing episodes. For those who are indifferent to the computer graphics, there is another storyline that is love of «the dream worker» to a beautiful female alien, who, being hostile and suspicious at first, falls in love with him. Such love is forbidden and as a result the pair is chased by the aliens. Happily, they managed to escape in the end. To my mind, the brillant acting of Sam Worthingdon, who is starring in the film, is above all expectations. To sum up, I can say that the film «Avatar» is that kind of film that takes us to a special world beyond imagination. More than that, it is the film that you want to watch over and over again. Definitely, the new film by Cameron couldn't be missed.",SHOW MORE,Avatar,Avatar - Movie Reviews

This is one movie that Just HAD to be seen in 3D! Loved it! Great action, special effects and a powerful story. The story has similarities from both Fern Gully and Dances with Wolves. I was blown away!! James Cameron did a great Job of creating this new world of Pandora and the Navi and the Beautiful creatures of this world. The cast such as leads Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana also did a tremendous job!

It's what I expected to see, after they've invested over $ 350 million doing it. And it's definitely what I was hoping to see to dramatically close a franchise that, in my opinion, should take a break so as not to saturate the genre.

59,Alex T,"Nov 16, 2021","I've always liked Marvel comics and followed the movies somewhat as a result, never really following the MCU, but due to movies like Endgame I feel like I'm really falling out with the fanbase. My view of Endgame is its just overrated beyond belief, I think the premise is okay in the sense that it ties all the previous movies up and includes many of the characters but its bad in the way in how destructive it is, disabling any kind of meaningful progression in the franchise. I feel in this way, the deaths in this film and the one before it are hollow where they have little meaning due to them being resurrected in a spinoff or in canon. Admittedly the special effects are impressive and the sheer scope of the movie is as well but is undermined by a destructive and substance-less story in addition to the its copious runtime. I'm sorry Marvel, you've lost me on this one.",Avengers: Endgame,Avengers: Endgame - Movie Reviews
60,Aidan B,"Nov 16, 2021","A fine film that, in my eyes, feels very overrated. The comedy feels more forced, the story is just constant fan-service, and the final fight scene feels more cringe than epic due to the goofiness of some of the choices they made (ie all the Avengers running in a line). While the beginning and ending was admittedly great, and the acting is still as good as ever, ""Avengers: Endgame"" just fails to hold a light to some of the far better installments in the MCU. While I still found the film to be mostly enjoyable, I was able to find enough glaring flaws during my rewatch to bring the score down.",Avengers: Endgame,Avengers: Endgame - Movie Reviews
61,Vito N,"Nov 15, 2021","After much thought I have come to the conclusion that this is my Favorite Movie of All Time. It's 3 hours long, and it's all worth it. There's so much to talk about this film whether it's the drama between Cap and his final fight, Tony and coming to peace with his father, or Thor realizing that it's him that makes the lighting and not the lightning that makes him. The action is the best it's ever been, the CGI is world class as always, and the performances from the entire ensemble cast is as good as it'll ever be. Is it a perfect film? Heck no, but it's as close to perfect as you could ever get, and it comes pretty damn close.

This classic movie has revolutionary CGI for its time, with the classic story of star-crossed-lovers transitioned to the Titanic perfectly, this film remains one of Cameron's best works ever put on the big screen.

85,Money G,"Nov 09, 2021","CMON! I was expecting more from the characters. I grew up in America and this is a movie commonly referenced in conversation. Sadly, it is a reflection of American taste and depth more than it is a beautiful movie. James Cameron extends greater consideration towards budget, set design, a panning camera, and scope of grandeur and disaster than what I identify as the real conflict worth tears. Not one person survived with a Third Class ticket. The rich negotiate, offer leverage, hide in spacious lifeboats and Rose survives instead of Jack. This is an accurate story but should be received as a tragedy instead of a romance. What lines of memorable dialogue are there? They pass the plot along, the ship must sink. There are memorable visuals, the set is magnificent, and the scene where voices stop and are frozen is excellent. However, unlike the iceberg, there is not enough depth.",Titanic,Titanic - Movie Reviews

100,Romina R,"Aug 30, 2021","There is a trend happening more now than ever where people hate on classic films for the sake of hating because they are classic films and loved by the majority of the public. As I start this ""Re-watching and Re-visiting films"" series, I will be repeating this many times. I do not quite get people's issue and ""beef"" (to put it less sophisticated) with Titanic. Is it one of the best movies of all time? Not quite. Is it a really well-done film that stays in our minds years and years after seeing it for the first time and if it is playing on a TV channel, you put it on? Why, yes. I understand the bother with a ""pointless"" love story plot line for dramatization but what's funny is that it works with the strong performances and magical chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet. But what I want to focus on in Titanic is the little scenes. There are many scenes where the tears uncontrollably fall down your face. Towards more the last section of the film where the boat officially sunk down, there is a shot from sky above of all the passengers screaming and flapping around the water. Up close, it is suffocating hysteria and from afar, it is just one sound in the middle of the gigantic ocean. People being left to die (as there are themes being shown of the lower class being purposely cast aside and the rich prioritized) and people coming to terms this might be their last breath on earth. Playing with camera angles intensifies a small scene for a viewer and makes that small scene stand out in a 3 hour movie.",Titanic,Titanic - Movie Reviews
101,JOHN U,"Aug 29, 2021","Shmaltzy, overly long, ridiculously well crafted and disarmingly heartfelt this movie is just larger than life. I think it's pacing problems are best summed up by the very first scene where Bill Paxton's character essentially does the same gag twice with the exact same reaction from his crewmember. Everything that is done in the present day in this film is essentially useless and definitely provides the most unnecessary though not the only element that makes this movie as grandiose as it is. I was ok with it all, but it made the film seem redundant in a lot of places. Do the present-day scenes add to the film? Yes, but only incidentally, it does put us in the frame of mind of the impending tragedy in a very delicate way and makes for a very meaningful and lovely ending scene but all of that was accomplishable in much less time-consuming ways. After all, the love story is the heart of the film, it would have been perfectly acceptable to keep it to just that. What happens on the Titanic is what really sets this movie apart. At it's core this is a romance and that's what gives the wide appeal of the film but in general terms, this is an absolute masterclass (and I can't stress that enough) in disaster film. I got the feeling that that was what drew James Cameron to the Titanic as a potential film, the slow sinking of such a lavish set piece, the impending and ever nearing doom as the water chases after our heroes as they struggle to survive. It is in the disaster elements (and in the glorious shots of the Titanic before that) that the film is entirely justified in it's longevity. The scale of such a disaster demands a film of such scale and Cameron was certainly the filmmaker, perhaps the only filmmaker, who was truly up to the challenge of giving the Titanic justice. So in terms of destruction, this movie absolutely floored me not even mentioning the staggeringly large scale and lavish set design. The scenes in the engine room particularly gave off a visceral sense of largeness and power that was awesome to behold even on my computer screen and the shots of the Titanic's propellers rearing from the water literally took my breath away. Its like this movie's sets are beefy. That's the word that came to me while watching it, I don't know why but that's what I thought. Of course, no amount of excellent cinematography, special effects, set design, music or sound editing will make a complete film and since we all know the story, a genuine personal touch was necessary for this movie to really excel. Well, I won't call it genuine per se but I will call it just as larger than life than the ship it took place on. I don't think it's a secret to anyone just how melodramatic this movie's nuclear romance between poor artist Jack and unsatisfied rich girl Rose is. I suppose it's also cliché to a point but I didn't really mind (it helped soften the cliches when James Horner's score just leans into the schmaltz with full force) I think the film does a good enough job with building up it's emotional center and it sprinkles in enough universally pitiable scenarios (the musicians, the babies, the families) to make it personally devastating as the long, slow burn of the Titanic's destruction unfolds in all of it's glory. The story didn't really hold any long-lasting meaning, but I don't mind that either, it was just a story aiming to be a crowd pleaser and a white knuckler at the same time, and it succeeded really well at both. I liked the whole ""jump together"" motif. Somehow, I didn't see its payoff coming and old Rose throwing the heart of the ocean into the sea really spoke some volumes about something… I don't know, it was emotionally resonant at the time. Came for the destruction, stayed with the romance long enough to actually get to the destruction and enjoyed the sweet, admittedly pretentious ending.",Titanic,Titanic - Movie Reviews

James Cameron achieved something remarkable in Titanic, with his relentless attention to detail, perfect direction and clever use of every trick in the special effects book to take the viewer aboard the great ship as she set sail in April, 1912. The underlying Romeo and Juliet love story of the film's two central characters, Jack and Rose, is engaging and bought to life by the perfectly cast Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet, who have just enough chemistry to make you care about their love story. A fantastic supporting cast of quality actors, perfectly cast, helps to bring this modern remake of A Night To Remember to life. You realise you have completely bought into the movie when you feel utter dread during the sinking scenes. Definitely one of the all-time greatest movies ever made.

The set is magnificent and the contrast between rich and poor as well as society expectation and free will is handled really well but the moment the ship hits the iceberg, it's near perfect. You truly feel the tension and fright as we see the effect of the sinking on so many people as well as the (let's be honest) terrible organization of the crew and the visuals hage aged super well. Hard to believe it's a 1997 movie. And gosh that last half made me cry, seeing the hopelessness of many of the victims and of course, Jack's death. I'm still pissed that Jack died but that bastard Cal survived. But still, incredible. It's definitely slow at times.

It is still just the third highest grossing film ever (however part of that comes from the 3-D rerelease) and still is quoted and talked about constantly to this day. Now is it a perfect movie, no. Is it overrated, absolutely. But there is still such a great nature to it that makes it honestly hard not to love (at least slightly). The first 90 minutes of the movie is essentially just a chick flick (and the writing is not the best) but it has such a charm to it and Leo and Kate’s chemistry is so likable that you can’t help but enjoy it (even if it isn’t the best). Then the rest becomes a completely different movie almost, as we see the titanic sink. This is where the movie really becomes phenomenal. The effects done and the cinematography and shots we get are great. Even though I’ve never really liked James Cameron much as a person you deny that he is a great director, especially with action scenes like the end to the movie. The entire last half of this movie is completely thrilling to watch and also it is heartbreaking when (spoiler alert) Jack dies (but you probably already knew that).

127,Aidan B,"Nov 20, 2021","""The Force Awakens"" opens this new ""Star Wars"" trilogy to an entertaining start, with groundbreaking CGI and action sequences, this film is easily the best in the whole trilogy. The new characters and places introduced are not entirely fresh or memorable, though they fit well into the story. Speaking of the story, I thought that this film was heading in a very interesting direction by making Finn, a stormtrooper that betrays the First Order, learn the ways of the Force. I also liked the character Rey, though I don't think that she should've been the main focus of the film. Kylo Ren is a very well done and emotional character though, and his connection to Darth Vader adds all the more depth to his character. Where I think this film fails, however, is the constant fan service that is done, which isn't done in a very creative way, rather it seems more of a cheat for that extra ""Hey I recognize that"" moment. It often plays on the nostalgia of those that grew up with the previous films and uses that nostalgia to power its main story.

154,Jacob B,"Sep 16, 2021",Star Wars 7: The force awakens (A-) (90%) Movie had so much hype before it's release and j.j. Abrams did a good job with it. Really wish that there was a more cohesive story throught the rest of the trilogy which ticks it down a bit now for me. But this movie and the other movies of the trilogy work better on their own then together. This movie in specific is just a whole lot of fun. Love seeing the rise of Kylo Ren (my favorite character from the sequels) and Harrison Ford back in action. Fun watch but don't get to attached to where the plot is taking the story in the other movies.,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,Star Wars: The Force Awakens - Movie Reviews

It has a large number of characters, and I like that each one has their moment to shine, that's a plus point. The actions of each character are completely justified, Thanos as the main antagonist is perfect, the reasons for which he acts are given and he gives more richness to the film. Anyway, you can not stay without seeing Infinity War, it is a good movie but I think it was enough for more, that if, this does not prevent you from enjoying it at all.",Avengers: Infinity War,Avengers: Infinity War - Movie Reviews

214,Jon M,"Sep 23, 2021","The word ""soulless"" covers most of my issue. The voice acting was entirely lacking heart, and in some cases was simply given poor direction. (Mufasa roars, and asks ""Is that a challenge?"" As if he's inviting Scar to tea.) John Oliver was entirely out of his depth, Ejiofor gives zero malice to the role, Beyonce over-sings every line, and Seth Rogen's perfectly played irreverence stands as the one bright spot.

215,Jayden D,"Sep 22, 2021","I have NOT been a fan of the rehashed remakes that Disney have put out as of late (Beauty & The Beast, Aladdin, Mulan...UGH...,Lady & The Tramp...not bad but mediocre) though I have 2 exceptions, The Jungle Book and this latest rendition of The Lion King. To be real, there's never gonna be a Lion King rendition that's gonna come anywhere close to the 1994 classic, let's be honest with ourselves. However for it's credit, this remake did not want to make me leave the theater in disgust. If anything it's a good movie that it's worth a watch, you just gotta dial down your expectations of the movie because some parts of it are kinda watered down and a bit of filler moments are put in there too which would explain this movie being 25 minutes longer than the original. Other than that, it does follow the script to the letter and makes for a good nostalgia high with modernized graphics. Props to the CGI team, this movie does look beautiful, probably the highest mark of the movie. It's not a bad Disney movie at all, the unfortunate part is that it does not surpass what the animated classic has already brought out to us and those are shoes that are almost impossible to fill so I can understand this movie falling short in some parts. It does make for a good comparison of what is being brought to this generation versus what my generation got as a kid growing up in the 90's.",The Lion King,The Lion King - Movie Reviews

It feels less like a remake or re-imagining than a remaster - viewers who want a new spin on a classic will be disappointed to find they are paying to see a movie they've already seen (albeit with a new coat of paint). While it's a shame that director/producer Jon Favreau added nothing new to this tale (despite proving his capabilities with 2016's vivid and fresh 'The Jungle Book') it manages to retain the soul of the original and is sufficiently entertaining. Excellent voice and vocal performances couple with stunningly life-like depictions of wild Africa and it's animal inhabitants to satisfy fans hoping to relive an old favorite, while offering new viewers an experience approximate to what the rest of us experienced in 1994, albeit with less facially emotive animals.",The Lion King,The Lion King - Movie Reviews

269,Michael S,"Dec 23, 2018","As any hardcore fan of the TV series knows, no actress was ever going to be able to fill the tights of icons like Honor Blackman and Diana Rigg. The producers should have known such fans would provide not an instant audience but an army of instant deplorers many of whom notoriously refused to even see the movie. What idiot producer then provides not just one unacceptable Uma, but adds a second unacceptable Uma in the bargain (Uma's dual role as both Emma Peel and nemesis)? Poor Uma never stood a chance, given she is a notoriously verveless actress especially compared to Diana Rigg. Uma turned out to be much more suited to originating roles that she was capable of playing (see Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill). As bad an idea as casting Thurman (or anyone in a film that shouldn't have been made), there was a great idea in casting Connery as the Bondian villain and this was the only potential drawing power the film really had (it was the only reason I went to see it!). Connery appears to be having the time of his life portraying the essence of maniacal glee. The script is awful, even if the science is not gibberish it's delivered at such breakneck speed it comes off as such. The actors spout dialogue at each other to zero reaction, like each one is occupying a separate room. Fiennes is credible in the action scenes, but otherwise is so bland as to blend into the wallpaper. If Patrick MacNee had feared being outdone in the role, they turned out to be groundless. If you actually need a reason to watch this, there are a few good moments reminiscent of Peel-era idiosyncratic oddball Avengers style moments, such as the Spectre-like villains meeting at a round table disguised as different colored teddy bears.",The Avengers,The Avengers - Movie Reviews

The two head off to the Ministry to meet Mother (Jim Broadbent), who informs them the Prospero project - an attempt to influence the weather - was sabotaged apparently by Emma Peel. Dr. Peel claims she is innocent, but she is sent to work alongside Steed to find the real culprit. Mother's off-sider, Father (Fiona Shaw), claims Peel suffers from a mental disease. They go off to visit Sir August De Wynter (Sean Connery), an old ally of The Ministry. He takes an instant liking to Peel, as they both share a love of weather. Steed and Emma follow a lead to Wonderland Weather - a business that artificially creates heat or rain with a special machine - where they discover two dead men in teddy bear suits. The members of a secret organisation - led by De Wynter - all wear teddy bear suits to disguise their identities. One of them, however, looks exactly like Emma Peel. Steed arrives in time to save Peel, as the double jumps off a roof and disappears. Steed and Emma go off to visit De Wynter at his mansion but are attacked by mechanical bees. Alice (Eileen Atkins), a Ministry agent, helps them to flee; nevertheless, De Wynter captures Emma who then tries to escape but finds herself trapped due to the mansion's ever-changing floor plan. She smashes her way through a window, and Steed rescues her. Back at Steed's apartment, however, Peel is arrested by Father, as Steed visits Invisible Jones (Patrick MacNee), a man inside The Ministry, to investigate the meaning of a map Steed found at Wonderland Weather. After viewing some photos of failed genetic experiments including cloning (revealing that the other Emma Peel is a clone), Steed determines Father is working with De Wynter. Father and Peel's clone capture Peel but are confronted by Mother, who is then incapacitated. De Wynter, controlling Prospero and the weather, confronts the world's leaders. He boasts that he controls the weather, and they will have to buy the weather from him, will pay a lot for it, and will have until midnight to pay... ""The Avengers"" is a 1998 American action spy film adaptation of the British television series of the same name that ran between 1961-1969. Warner Bros., the film's distributor, refused to allow any early press-screenings for movie reviewers that most releases attempt to generate interest in; such a decision is often made when a studio and/or distributor knows a film will not be received well and pre-release reviews would only be negative. The film was originally scheduled to open earlier in June 1998 but was pushed back until August, often referred to as the late-summer ""dumping ground"" for films that are not felt to be strong or worthy enough to open on the more lucrative holiday weekends in early summer. The film was a notable failure at the box office, grossing only $48 million worldwide, compared to its budget of $60 million. Mick LaSalle, of the San Francisco Chronicle, warned against poor editing and direction, explaining; ""There's.......some business involving a dead ringer for Emma going around causing trouble, and there's some mention of the word ""cloning."" Then all talk of that is dropped. Everything is dropped. After a slow opening, the 90-minute movie jolts into climax mode. What happened to the middle? Clearly, this wasn't just edited but gutted. No doubt they did us all a favor, but it doesn't help. Instead of just being a bad picture, the missing middle makes ""The Avengers"" a bad and weird and strangely off picture. One example: There's never a moment when Emma and Steed realize who the villain is. At first, they don't know. Next, they're in a titanic battle to the death. At one point, Emma is shackled and floating around in a hot-air balloon. I don't know how she got there. I must have blinked. Due to internal wrangling at Warner Bros., the decision was made to vastly cut down the running time after test screenings, reducing the 115-minute film to 87 minutes, sacrificing much coherence and continuity in the process. Key scenes removed included the opening sequence in which ""Mrs. Peel"" infiltrates and destroys the Prospero science installation; early trailers included the scene where she says the words ""How now brown cow"" in a false telephone box to gain admittance. The movie was originally scored by composer Michael Kamen, who included the original Avengers theme; however he was unable to re-score the film after the radical editing, so was forced to drop out. The recut version of the film was scored by Joel McNeely. The original script was used for the film's novelization and included all the material which were first shot and then removed from the film. The original cut has yet to surface; Warner Bros. has no plans to release a director's cut or special edition in any form, despite that director Jeremiah Chechik has offered to recut the film for free. The film was panned by critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes consensus reads, ""A TV spinoff that lacks enough energy to spin, The Avengers is an ineptly written, woefully miscast disaster."" The purists disliked it for its disrespect to the original series (particularly the introduction of a romance between Steed and Peel - a carefully ambiguous subject in the series). Newcomers were lost by all of the misfired attempts to capture the mood of the original. Rod Dreher in the New York Post called the film ""a big fat gob of maximum crapulosity, the kind of shallow, stupid, big-budget cow pile that smells of Joel Schumacher"", referencing the previous summer's likewise poorly received Batman & Robin, which also starred Uma Thurman. David Bianculli stated, ""This Avengers film is so horrendously, painfully, and thoroughly awful that it gives other cinematic clunkers like Ishtar and Howard the Duck a good name."" Jay Boyer in the Orlando Sentinel said ""The Avengers is, without a doubt, the worst movie of the summer"". Reception in Britain was equally hostile. The Birmingham Post stated ""The Avengers is being slated by critics as the worst film ever made - such a turkey, says one, that the makers should have handed distribution to (mass turkey producer) Bernard Matthews"". Alan Jones in The Radio Times stated ""The cult 1960s TV series gets royally shafted by Hollywood in this stunningly designed blockbuster that's stunningly awful in every other department... Terrible special effects and zero chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman make this notorious disaster a total waste of everyone's time and energy."" Commenting on the truncated released cut of the film, New York Times's Janet Maslin noted, ""At a pared-down, barely rational 90 minutes, ""The Avengers"" is short but not short enough."" I did not grow up with the original ""The Avengers"" (1961-1969) but I know of the show, the main characters and the actors. This is yet another example of a film that was slaughtered in the editing room when they reduced the 115-minute film to 87 minutes, sacrificing much coherence and continuity in the process. Everything in the film feels random, campy, poor and as said there´s no coherence nor continuity which gives us a very confusing film. With A-list stars like Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman and Sean Connery you´d think there would be potential, but the end result is far from it. All three seems to have no idea what´s going on due to mediocre direction. I reckon charm, style and fun was the main pillars of the tv-show, but with the film all of that is not in place. It´s a weird and strange unfunny film in many ways and you really struggle to find anything that is good about it. The effects are shoddy and the script silly in an Austin Powers way. Once the colourful teddybears appears in the film you realise that this film will never recover. Trivia: Peter Bart's book ""The Gross"" covered the film's unfolding disaster in great detail. Among other facts: Warner Brothers greenlit the film largely on the strength of a star-packed cast and their appreciation of Jeremiah Chechik's work on Diabolique (1996) and were horrified when seeing what the first cut was like. The first screening took place in front of a ""largely Spanish-speaking, working class"" audience in Phoenix, Arizona, who hated the film; the studio then forced Chechik to cut many of his favorite scenes, and conduct reshoots; and the final cut went from 115 to 89 minutes, and was completely incoherent. The studio even refused to hold further test screenings, or to have an official premiere before the film's August 1998 release. Ralph Fiennes said of the film, ""I think it's a badge of honor to have a real flop on your resumé"".",The Avengers,The Avengers - Movie Reviews

It's not deep and only clever in its small details, but it is well constructed, well paced, well choreographed and features the type of performances perfect for a cast of actors who are mid-level at acting, but big on charisma. The actual bits where the cars go fast are intense, intricate and extremely well staged & well executed. Even better, this movie features a central villain played wonderfully by Statham and a muscle-baddie played by the always amazing Tony Jaa, and while the latter is notably underused, both of them are a lot of fun to watch when on screen, giving the silly-but-likeable heroes a larger-than-life obstacle. Honestly I strongly recommend this movie if you like well-made movies that don't require any usage of the brain to enjoy; like, if you've had a long and frustrating day at work and you want to enjoy something explosive while simultaneously relaxing, Furious 7 more than does the job.

Statham is great in his limited screen time, and the script and characters are great but the director couldn't pull it together with tension and visual realism like Justin Lim somehow perfected with the 5th and 6th films. Even with all the crazy stunts and set pieces in those two films, if felt very thrilling and weirdly grounded. Some moments recreate that style to an extent, but other moments fall flat in visual unrealism. The final act/set-piece, while very stupid however, was pretty awesome though.

I knew this movie was going to be dumb - they've all been dumb up to this point - but most of the rest of them have been dumb in a fun way. Unfortunately this one really flirts with just being dumb in a dumb way. The plot makes very little sense when it's given an ounce of thought, and characters inexplicably trust others for no reason other than to keep things moving. The humor is more forced than usual, with characters rarely leaving their archetypes. This movie is filled with tropes and cliches, but this franchise is so influential that it's hard to tell if it's regurgitating these tropes or inventing them. Also, Dwayne Johnson is severely underutilized. All of that being said, of course it's still fun. It's got the fast cars and the stunts we're expecting. The movie is stuffed with easter eggs and inside jokes (cars don't fly!). The familial theme is there, although not as obvious as in the previous entries, and there are heartwarming moments.

However, the fun continues making it likeable and fun enough to watch. In here Jason Statham is brought as the villain who is obviously one dimensional but has a legitimate grievance. The send off of Paul Walker incredibly works well although some of the scenes look weird knowing he is not really there but the movie pays tribute to the tune of When I see you again specifically written for his passing. Finally the Rock continues to prove how badass he is in these movies despite a limited role in this one.",Furious 7,Furious 7 - Movie Reviews

333,Stephy S,"Oct 23, 2021","An overall improvement upon its predecessor. Frozen II is exactly what you'd want from a sequel, more songs, more charming character moments and interactions and some absolutely gorgeous animation! First off, with this being a musical, you got to have some good songs and Frozen II definitely doesn't lack in that department, with the highlights being Lost in the Woods, The Next Right Thing and Into the Unknown. The acting was also top-notch as you'd come to expect from the returning cast. Especially Kristen Bell and Jonathan Groff deliver on some exceptionally charming and delightful performances. But without a doubt, the biggest praise I can give this movie is the animation. Hot damn, It's truly something else. The water looks too real for an animated flick and the movement is just as great and fluent. The character designs are also very exquisite and distinct. Unfortunately, it isn't all sunshine and rainbows. Some characters are painfully underutilized. Kristoff gets kicked out of the story early on and doesn't get to do anything meaningful and the new additions to the ensemble of characters aren't used in any meaningful in creative ways. All of these characters seemed to have some great potential for fun and quirky character interactions and had some noteworthy chemistry. Finally, the world-building is hit or miss. They introduce some really cool concepts and themes into the universe but they feel a bit rushed and half-baked. Some of them could've been thought out a little better while others feel like they aren't properly explained to the audience. In short, Frozen II might not be a subversive and perfect sequel but it's still pretty solid. It's truly a miracle this movie still turned out so good considering the rushed and problematic production.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews
334,Jan B,"Oct 18, 2021","As we all know, Disney has completely taken over, especially when it comes to movies. Frozen 2, amongst the singing and dancing, deals with real issues, like growing up and finding your place, your purpose. Though it may be a little heavy for some younger kids, those who grew up watching the first frozen movie, like me, find a real message embedded in the plot and various popular songs. The songs are just one portion of how the movie is dealing with these issues, such as change. For example, the first song describes how some things will be the same no matter what happens. Things like family and friends and true love. However, as the movie progresses we can see that things change regardless of what we do, some quite ironically if I might add. In the first song they sing about how the flag will always fly, and as soon as the spirits wake up and show their wrath to the city, the flag is ripped from the flagpole with the wind. For characters like Anna, this is a hard realization that things are changing. In the same breath, as those things change, we figure out a way to handle the change for the better, and that not all change is bad. Another topic they deal with is growing up. The kids who watched the first movie when it came out, grew a whole 6 years before the second movie came out. For me, I was in high school and applying for college when the second movie came out. Growing up is a scary topic and it could evoke some unhappy feelings for younger kids, especially those who don't like change. Frozen 2 also implies some falsehood about growing up, ""When you're older, absolutely everything makes sense"", as adults, we know this statement doesn't ring very true. On the same note, as you grow and go through life, you can find your place in this world, your purpose, just like Elsa and Anna did. Elsa found her place in the enchanted forest as the fifth spirit, and Anna found her place as the queen of Arendelle, which is arguably where they both belong. Aside from the positives and negatives to Frozen 2, I honestly think it's a great movie. It is more suited for slightly older audiences, but the topics that this movie deals with are important, even the heavy ones. Everything changes eventually, everyone grows up, but growing up and changing isn't necessarily a bad thing. It can definitely be intimidating, but it does ring true that no matter what changes, things will be okay. In my opinion, that is a great message for kids who are scared of growing up and finding their place in the world, like I was.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews

352,Manuela B,"May 28, 2021","I want to speak about Frozen II. This film is directed by Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee, they had realized the first movie also. The mains characters are Elsa and Anna the voice respectively of Indiana Menzel and Kristen Bell. The movie was released on 2019 by Walt Disney Pictures. The film tells a story of two sisters who lost their parents during the first movie. Anna and Elsa lives in the Arendelle's castle, Elsa is the queen. After the death of their parents, Elsa heard a mysterious voice call out to her. So she left the castle and the citizens to follow this voice. Anna, her sister is stubborn as a mule, she follows Elsa during this adventure. Many things will happen Personally I love this plot, I find it entertaining, touching and also interesting. In Frozen , there are a lot of specials effects. Elsa has a power, she can built an ice house, frozen the way, make a snow. Her power is very captivating, and beauty. For exemple in Frozen I Elsa make a snowman for her sister. The movie is an animation, the draws are very well done. The characters to appears real. I saw the making of, and it is a very long work. The details are important, we can see the emotions, the feeling of the characters is interesting. For exemple when Elsa sing, there is a close up, we see the character's face , the profound emotion. I thinks the script is good. For exemple Olaf the snowman is hilarious, even if is a snowman, the characters is lovable. We can laugh when he makes a joke. I recommended this film,to anyone who loves the Disney animation. Seriously, when I see this film I can cry, laugh, have all emotions. Waltz Disney animation makes characters very captivating. Songs are choose with attention. Everybody know « let's it go » this song is moving. I'm full of admiration for Frozen. The animation is difficult, isn't easy. Waltz Disney makes a interesting job. I'm never be disappointed by Disney Animation. Really go to see this film because is incredible.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews

359,Jesse D,"May 05, 2021","7.0/10. Have you seen the first Frozen? If you have kids, like Disney films, or have a pulse, it's more than likely you answered yes. And given that yes is your answer, then you have already seen the better of the two films. While Frozen 2 is still a good film, especially for those with children to entertain, it doesn't reach the heights of it's predecessor in any appreciable anyway. The animation is as good as ever, the perfect voice cast from the original return, and this heroine-led story has action, laughs, and some meaningful moments. But so did the first Frozen, which did all of that, but better. While the narrative foundations for Frozen 2 are arguably stronger than the boiler-plate fairy-tale original, this film adds too many unimportant characters and slices the film into separate plots that aren't always engaging. The tear-jerker moments don't jerk as effectively and the soundtrack pales in comparison it's counterpart; it almost concedes the point when it uses motifs from the original on more than one occasion. That's not to say it does any of these things poorly - this movie has heart and a good soundtrack, but it stands in the shadow of one of Disney's biggest recent hits. Some things never change, including that Disney's freshest ideas are usually better than the retreads.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews
360,Dollores L,"Apr 24, 2021","I thought Frozen 2 was a whole lot better than the first one. In the first one it overall just made me frustrated at what they did and said. I wholeheartedly agree that the songs in the first movie are 100% better than the ones in the second (minus Olaf's solo). However, in the second the characters look way more mature. I was so surprised when I saw how good they actually looked. Yes, I know that looks aren't everything but I thought that that was something important that should be pointed out. In the second I didn't exactly understand the point they were trying to get across though. What really saved the movie, for me, and made it a whole lot better was Olaf. He is by far my favorite character and I am guessing most everyone else too. Olaf makes the most hilarious comments and his solo song made me and my whole family laugh. Not going to lie, without Olaf the movie would most likely be a dud. I liked the story line of trying to save the enchanted forest and it gave me some real Moana vibes. I thought all the element characters were well thought out and I especially had a soft spot for the adorable little fire lizard/gecko. My least favorite part of the movie is either during the opening song ""some things never change"" or when Christoph has his solo ""Lost in the woods"". I was cringing hard during both of these songs. The first one that I listed was extremely sappy and made me shudder multiple times during the song. As for ""Lost in the woods"" I thought it was the most cringy of all the songs. It looked like they were going for an old montage theme for that song. I actually went to get refills for my drink and popcorn during it because I was so unsettled. (the popcorn was delicious by the way 🍿) I thought the songs were all sung extremely well and they even had me singing along at some parts. (I don't think the others in the theater were impressed though) I wouldn't consider this a must watch to those who haven't even seen the first but if you have then you NEED to see this one too. By the end of the movie you will have had some good laughs and I honestly believe that it won't feel like a waste of time.",Frozen II,Frozen II - Movie Reviews

The writing is witty and handles all the characters differently but emotionally and mostly in a clever way, with stand out characters being Tony and Wanda but the real pinnacle of the film being Ultron. Much like the movie, the only reason he is not the best villain in marvel is cos we have so many great ones, because Ultron is a hilarious and threatening, well designed marvelous (see what i did there) mix of Tony, Bruce and Vision who has motives that line up with Iron Man's character leeding to real deep dives into the sea of his phyce. The story is mostly simple, with many well choreographed but somtimes boring fight scenes and lot's of exposition but you have to remember that it's introducing three new characters here AND trying to move development on for the Og's. The movie set's up further Marvel movies, like Civil War, and gives our heroes something internal to recon with while still leaving us asking questions that we know will be answered.

397,Cailan D,"Jul 20, 2021","Avengers: Age of Ultron unfortunately falls into the ""sequel is worse"" trap. The writing and directing lack the finesse that they had in the first Avengers and are both awkward at times. Ultron, though Spader gives a pretty good performance as him, isn't the greatest villain because it seems that he dislikes the Avengers for reasons that aren't personal to him. He attempts to come off as sort of a ""people person"" but ultimately fails to do so because of his goals and execution. The humor is decent but not as good as it is in other MCU installments and is hampered by the script. The biggest issue of Age of Ultron is that it's a very ambitious film and tries to do too much with its runtime. There are multiple stories going on so as to set up future movies and the movie would've done better with a more specific focus. All that said, the actors as usual do their best to overcome the script and are successful at doing so in many instances. The chemistry between them helps to carry scenes where other elements don't work as well. One highlight of this film is actually one of the low points of the first Avengers, being Clint Barton/Hawkeye. This movie treats him very differently than its predecessor and gives him more screen time and moments to shine. His speech to Wanda during the climatic battle is one of the best speeches in the entire MCU and his arc gives more depth to his character and leaves plenty of opportunities for future development and storytelling. The action sequences are entertaining enough and should keep viewers engaged for the full runtime. While Age of Ultron is far from the best the MCU has to offer, it has some redeeming qualities and is worth taking a look at.",Avengers: Age of Ultron,Avengers: Age of Ultron - Movie Reviews

However, with certain deaths revealed the true glorious purposes that those characters were burdened with. I saw some of them in different light, and it was very sad. The beginning started just a little bit slow, but after that, the movie became unrelentingly thrilling. Even though it's the shortest in runtime in the franchise, I was basically glued to the TV the entire time. I sensed so much urgency in Harry and could not be more invested in him and his allies. The ending did not disappoint and delivered plenty explosion, wizardry, and valor from the characters. Everyone united and faced the strong and desperate dark lord himself. It was glorious.

The one 1/2 down-grade I gave it was actually due to the final duel scene with Harry & Voldemort, right after Neville Longbottom kills Voldemort's snake, Nagini, with the Sword of Griffindor. The simple cracking of Voldemort's face and then scattering away in the wind in tiny pieces was a complete slap in the face to audiences that deserved a MUCH more intense demise after following this movie series for 10 years. Lets face it, if we started our kids on the first movie at age six, they would have been sixteen when the last installment was released. I'm fairly confident they could have handled a more severe send-off to one of the screen's most hated characters. Did anyone in the theater you attended applaud loudly and yell vocally when Voldemort was defeated. Our's was packed and not a peep from anyone when he was killed by Harry. There you have it.

This movie hardly competes with any other because of its circumstances where the somewhat flawed buildup was all shoved into a different movie entirely, leaving this one with the sole task of delivering a lengthy fan-service climax to the entire franchise with a practically unlimited budget and plenty of characters whose arcs were 95% finished. The plot revelations were the best part of the movie, followed by the special effects, then the acting prowess displayed by the leads (especially Fiennes and Bonham Carter in this one), then the dramatic and memorable film score. The most touching scene of the movie and perhaps the entire series for me was Hermione offering to go into the woods with Harry - it came off incredibly altruistic and human, hitting me right in the feels unexpectedly in a way that Snape's memories did not. There were some things I would've preferred to see happen with the characters than what did, though that's mainly a very minor gripe with the source material. This was extremely successful as an ending to the series and deserves its spot as the highest-rated movie in it, even if that's mostly for getting to adapt only the exciting parts of one of the novels.

If the previous three film (Order of Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince, and Deathly Hallows part 1) if these films were the resistance underground films, this one is the out and out war film with wall to wall action, separated by a few tender quieter moments in between. In the last stand battle of Hogwarts everybody showed their bravery. Dame Maggie Smith's Prof. Mcgonagall got a moment to show how badass she is taking over Hogwarts, and Neville Longbottom was one of the most courageous young wizards, standing up for the Dark Lord himself. He was so brave he earned the right to wield the Sward of Gryffindor and truly save the day. That said, the true sacrifice came from Snape, the most misunderstood hero of the story. He gave up his entire life and managed to live as an outcast for years just to protect Harry and fool the Dark Lord, he managed to have a final moment with Harry which just made me very emotional. The final showdown between Harry and Voldemort was short and sweet. The Dark Lord's hubris lead to his downfall after our heros managed to take him down piece by piece working together, and utilizing the Deathly Hallows for good not for personal gains. The film then was bookended with a happy scene at the train to Hogwarts 16 years later, with the new generation of wizards starting their first year at the school.

Does this film play heavily on your memories and nostalgia of a cinematic masterpiece? Absolutely. Is this a Hollywood blockbuster to entertain your kids and eat popcorn to? Most certainly. But beyond that, this is just poorly made. After finishing the film, I had to wrack my brain for hours to try to understand what I witnessed, and what it meant. And I've come to the conclusion that it is simply confused. Masterfully confused. It tries both to be everything at once and an intricately focus-tested action romp. It tries to be a skit comedy, an action-adventure, a space opera, a drama, a romance, and an action spectacle. And it fails on almost all counts. At very least it was entertaining. If you enjoy Star Wars, you'll see everything you want to see here. There are X-Wings, and blaster lasers; there are jedi and lightsabers; epic swordfights, big explosions, and more. It's quite fun if you don't take it seriously at all! But that's the inherent issue, isn't it? Star Wars isn't just some nonsense sci-fi romp; it's one of the biggest sci-fi epics in the entire genre's history.

It's a phrase for killing the past, deconstructing old beloved characters, having stupid plot twist for its own sake, having no respect for the old fans at all, pushing a political agenda and using a franchise to parading your own ego as a filmmaker. What Rian Johnson did here - as a filmmaker (not as a person), is unforgivable. Many fans watched Star Wars in their youth when they had troubled times - they looked up to the characters - especially to Luke Skywalker. It's not only a shallow action figure - it was a symbol of goodness and hope. ""The Last Jedi"" makes a bitter, cynid old grump of Luke - who cowardly nearly killed his defenseless nephew, left his friends and family alone and dies off alone in the end.

Considering that they didn't quite know where this story was heading to, I think Johnson did a fantastic job. The theme of failure being a lesson throughout the movie was really cool to see. It wasn't just blasters and action and everybody wins; it was much more layered than that. Luke being an irritable hermit to me was very fitting after what he went through. And on top of this was the intricate budding relationship with Rey and Ben Solo was great. It showed them both of having flaws and I think that's needed in the Star Wars Universe more. Both feel lost and hopeless and alone, but they realize they have a connection this way. Is it a healthy relationship? Not at all but I like that it showed the grey of their personalities inside such and black and white universe. Also, bringing back the puppet Yoda made me tear up in nostalgia.

The script doesn't help--at every possible opportunity, the story is forced to be some sort of swelling, dramatic, climax--strange, since it is hard to feel anything given how soulless it turns out to be.

Rian Johnson is on record of saying the best films are ones that half the audience likes and the other half hates. Mission accomplished. Though I'd say it was 10/90 like/hate. The film's story had no cohesive structure. It was more like multiple, unrelated subplots hewn together like a kindergarten level collage.

The Last Jedi breaks everything we know as a trilogy... and that's perfect. You just have no ideia of what to expect, because actually, everything can happen at anytime, and things really does happen. Director Rian Johnson knows what make a Star Wars movie and a great sci-fi epic, setting the bars pretty high for this one visually, technically and narratively, not just making it a love letter for the real fans, but putting it up there with The Empire Strikes Back in a kind of surprising manner, while also setting it apart from his older ""trilogy brother"" by the inventively corageous plot, the gorgeous presentation and the mind-blowing twists.",Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi,Star Wars: The Last Jedi - Movie Reviews

The lack of world building is prevalent The most idealistic person in the galaxy was turned into a cynical and brooding hermit. The fact that the true escape plan is kept from Poe Damaren is infuriating. They kill off Snoke and Captain Phasma before any arc can be established. Their main character is so utterly forgettable. Instead of exploring Finn's background they turn him into a bumbling idiot. He could of been a scarred anti-hero with a dark past. By attempting to subvert the viewer's expectations the film makers subverted all the fun right out of the movie.

Also, the Holdo maneuver would have been more effective at the beginning of the chase, thus saving the rest of the vessels of the resistance. Also, where is the rest of the New Republic military.

Here are my reasons: - Memorable and well developed characters. - An original and well-executed story. - A soundtrack that was only surpassed! like photography, it's the best! The original essence of the first movies is back! and the CGI is great! It is very well worked, you can see the dedication with which it was made. - Finally, we cannot forget that we will open the doors for what is to come in 2022 in Jurassic World: Dominion!

509,huyqiwd s,"Jun 24, 2021",Okay this movie sucks. I'll start with everything I hate. The movie is really cheap and it starts off with with claire wanting to save the dinosaurs even though they should be extinct. She cries about it. The trailers are also annyoing they just showed every single good part of the movie to make you think it is going to be good. They showed all of jeff goldblums performance and they try to shove in so many dinosaurs. It has an allosaurus a carnotorus a baryonyx a synoceratops and of course they are going to make rexy kill off the bad guy at the end. It is too predictable but perhaps the worst thing about this movie is they keep copying the other ones and they do that to much. It is basically the lost world but in a more modern way. The plot twist about the clone girl is stupid the characters are stupid and all while this is going you have bad acting unnecessary scenes and overall a horrible plot. The first scene is the only good scene in the whole movie. I think the worst actor of all is bryce dallas howard chris pratt was okay I don't know why he is so good with this role but so bad when he plays stare lord in the mcu. Speaking of marvel the jurassic world movies have so many actors that have been in marvel movies for example chris pratt bryce dallas howard ty simpkons vincent d'nofrio sam neil jeff goldblum jake johnson but that's not really there fault.

This is hands down one of the best musicals Disney has created. This starts with the amazing work of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez who were the song composers for this film and Christophe Beck who was the score composer. The score wonderfully sets the backdrop and the songs are all memorable and work so well with the themes and character arcs. The casting is also perfect as all the main character voice actors have experience performing on Broadway. The work on the animation is also well done with great particle effects for the snow and noticeable improvements on human hair. I understand the oversaturation of this film in pop culture, however I fully believe it is well deserved.

The first part was released in 2013 and made a splash. 3 Speaking of the plot, it is quite heavy even for an adult, because even my parents were touched by the plot. The drawing itself is at a height, everything is very clear and every detail is drawn, which pleases the eyes. One of the most important things is that even though it is a cartoon, but all the emotions are perfectly conveyed and touch the soul. Thanks again to the smallest details, you can very well understand each character, well, except for Prince Hans( my most hated character). Of course, the cartoon has a sequel, this is its second part, but the first one will always remain in my heart. Although, I don't mind the third part) so ""Frozen"" is the best animated film I've ever seen.

It really differs from your average Disney movie as it isn't based on ""true love kiss"" and ""boys"" and ""I need a prince to rule."" The characters are hilarious and make you smile. But if you are watching with kids you will probably be hearing ""Let it go!"" for weeks on end. Even as a teenager now, my little sister puts it on and I sit with her and actually enjoy most of it.

570,Dale R,"Nov 15, 2021","A live action remake of the 1991 animated film of the same name. There are some big names in this film: Emma Watson as Belle, Dan Stevens as Beast, Luke Evans as Gaston, Josh Gad as LeFou, Ewan McGregor as Lumiere, Ian McKellen as Cogsworth, etc. They all do a great job with what they are given, except for the music. With the exception of ""Gaston"", all the songs in this film feel unemotional and over processed. Some of this, I feel, is due to the fact that there is limited musical theater experience with the actors chosen for this film. Ewan McGreagor is good, but he can't hold a candle (pun intended) to Jerry Orbach's many years of musical acting experience. The CGI for the Beast's face was lacking and I'm sure it hid a great facial performance from Stevens. There were a couple of scenes where Watson felt like a stick saying, or singing, lines. The added material didn't feel necessary to the story, though some of the plot holes from the original film were plugged. Nostalgia fueled the success of this film and maybe that will be enough for you to enjoy it as well.",Beauty and the Beast,Beauty and the Beast - Movie Reviews

589,Urainia S,"Jun 07, 2021","I really love the moral behind ""Beauty and the Beast"", and it's the only Disney romance which still gets me. It's an important lesson about the ideas behind the curse of Beauty. In my mythological soup, this stands for The Judgment of Paris, where Aphrodite was chosen as the fairest (Athena DID NOT like this) because of her ability to provide a beautiful wife for the shepherd prince. The Beast becomes a Beast in mind because he has objectified his kingdom through beauty. Beast is a stand-in for Mercury, and/or Dionysus, and that's why the beautiful Athena-like witch shows up in ugly drag to test his hospitality. When he turns the witch away based on exterior appearances, not recognizing the beauty of her wisdom, she curses his kingdom to be physical objects until Beauty reappears. Then it's up to Beauty to reverse the curse through her wisdom, by seeing past the objectification of the Beast as a horrible animal to locked up in a mansion with his material things. It's important here that Belle is the hero. The Beast can't fix himself, he's the victim, and only someone who reads books and doesn't just stare at the covers can put it all together before the rose loses her last petal...",Beauty and the Beast,Beauty and the Beast - Movie Reviews

Best parts of the movie were indeed the raccoon, Jack-Jack, and scenes with Edna Mode. During the latter parts of the movie, I literally just wanted it to end. Three years (2015-2018) of waiting for this movie, walked out extremely disappointed. Watched it for the second time last night, no, just an absolute no. I understand the animation was smoother. But certain scenes were ""cut"" too sharply. The ending of Edna Mode's scene was abrupt, cant quite describe it. If you watch it at that point, you'll understand. So sad. There was so much potential.

627,Jacob R,"Jul 03, 2021","Ok, so this movie is pretty good, and has all the good stuff from the original movie, but it has a few too many problems that prevent it from being as good as the first movie. First, all the things that I thought were basically spectacular. All the stuff that involves them actually being superheros is really good, not better then what was in the first, but still really good. Next is the animation, which feels very different then all the others. This feels like it's stylized for the 1950s, which the film takes place. Some people can find that distracting, but I didn't. Also, all the new characters are either good or funny, except for one thing, but I'll save that for a little later. Now, let's talk about all the things that this movie just didn't do well enough in, which keeps it from being as good as the original. The main thing is really the characters that are brought back. Except for Elastagirl, Frozone, and Jack-Jack, all the old characters feel significant weaker. I don't want to say this, but the worse character in this movie by far is Mr Incredible. He is either acting completely crazy, completely mean or ignorant, or is not really blaming himself for everything that is going wrong with the family. I'm sorry, that's a huge problem that you can't fix with just one scene. Violet and Dash seem weaker too, but I was able to look past them. I, however, cannot look past Mr Incredible. Also, another big problem is the stupid twist villain. I know Pixar has done them before, but only one of them was actually bad (Miles Axelrod from Cars 2 ring a bell for anyone?). That is…until the Screenslaver shows up. This was the first time I was able actually to predict the twist villain in a Pixar movie, which made it super boring. It's also really hard when the last villain in this franchise, Syndrome, is the best Pixar villain ever. So, with all of that said, I still think this a good film that everyone should watch. All the superhero stuff (besides the villain), is still spectacular, you're just gonna have to sit through a bunch of the family stuff that isn't as strong. I think that's the biggest difference between this movie and the original. ""The Incredibles"" is a family and character study first, and a superhero movie second. ""Incredibles 2"", however, is a superhero film first, and a family film second. If you don't mind the change, then you'll think this movie is great! If not, like me, you'll only think the movie is pretty good, almost great. But hey, why listen to me? Go to Disney+ and watch this almost ""Incredible"" movie!",Incredibles 2,Incredibles 2 - Movie Reviews

But anyway, that's just a minor inconvenience. I hope that's the only problem I have with this movie, other than probably the fact that it's nowhere as memorable as the first movie. While The Incredibles is something of a pop culture icon this movie is, well, let's just say we'd have never learnt about it if it wasn't advertised so much. Incredibles 2 starts off from the part where the prequel left. And it finally answers the question of what happened in the fight between the Parr family and the Moleman - It... Happened. The only thing that came out of it was that Violet's BF learnt about her identity, which was later wiped out (or so I remember, I don't even think this movie was memorable enough. I'm remembering all the scenes as I'm writing this). So now Helen is out on another adventure, leaving Bob with the kids. And he's terrible at handling them. It was a very funny scene, seeing him struggle everyday trying to help Dash with his homework and Jack Jack in changing his diapers. The family moves into a new home which is way better than their previous one. Dash and Violet discover Bob's car and they bring it home. Then something something Helen finds out the guy who she's working with has a sister who is her costume designer, and she's secretly evil. And now it's up to the kids to save the day with all the superpowers and plot armours. See this is exactly the problem of this movie. It is super predictable, although that's not a bad thing since the way those scenes are executed make it very satisfactory to watch. The animation of this movie is probably the best thing about it. It is one of the only things which has improved drastically since the first movie. The Incredibles, you might remember, was very cool. But I just wrote a review of it yesterday and it was then that I realised the quality of that movie has aged terribly. In terms of polygon count this one takes the win. However, I also mentioned in that review that the thing which makes The Incredibles so much fun to watch is that it feels like a videogame, something similar to Sonic the Hedgehog or Spider-Man for PS4. That's not something I could say about this movie. Incredibles 2 isn't one of the movies Pixar is known for making. It's something of a sequel that can only satisfy you that the fight in the end of the first movie didn't end on a suspenseful note. It is a one-time watch for the fans of the first movie, although the kids might like it since the movie seemed to be more oriented towards them.",Incredibles 2,Incredibles 2 - Movie Reviews
632,Jerry S,"Jun 17, 2021","(SPOILERS) Honestly I am almost tempted to say I like Incredibles 2 better that the original. The characters are great as always and there is some real character development the music is spot on and I really enjoyed the moments between Bob and his kids and the awesome action sequences between Helen her self. I honestly have a blast watching this sequel, however the only problem that I have with this movie is the villain Evilen Deavor. On the one hand her character is really great. She and her brother Winston Deavor have interesting and intense back stories and have good moments with each other, however the movie kinda drags just a tad because there really trying to hide the fact that one of them is the main villain. Another thing is that Evilen's plan can kinda get confusing at times. However that doesn't mean that it takes away from the movie itself though. There is this seen with the Screen Slayer a villain that Evilen herself created and has some of coolest moments in the movie. However going into that seen though there are flashing lights so you have been warned. That scene was pretty thrilling and even haunting. However the best action scene in the entire movie was the opening which was just straight awesome and so satisfying.

Of course it's not the original but it took a well known story and added onto it perfectly. I enjoy how it focused on Elastagirl and really showed how before becoming a house wife she was a force to be reckoned with. I think the villain was very unique and there was a good twist added in.

659,Jean L,"Jul 09, 2021","The Fate of the Furious continues the downhill spiral of mediocrity that is the fast and furious franchise. Once a fairly ok but fun series of movies about street racing and fighting organized crime has now become a multi million dollar franchise about extraordinary heist crime action that defies the laws of physics, stupid characters, plot devices that make no sense, and just simple stupidity. Previous movies are fun enough to watch including this one but it does not make it good. In this one Dominic Toretto played by Vin Diesel betrays his team of street racers turned into international crime fighters with nice cars. The story is completely ludicrous although it tries to make some sense but in the end is just dumb. The villain played by Charlize Teron is badass and formidable as Teron brings her incredible presence that she carries into every movie yet the character motives are questionable and flat out cartoony. The only fun thing here is The Rocks and Jason Stahams chemistry which is hilarious and great which led to the spin off Hobbs and Shaw. Otherwise the rest is a bunch of explosions and impossible action pieces in a movie universe that is supposed to be realistic and is now trying to mimic superhero movies. This franchise is losing steam.",The Fate of the Furious,The Fate of the Furious - Movie Reviews

That's the dumbest thing to have in a FF movie. Rewatch this before seeing F9 tomorrow. Not gonna bother talking about the story, cliche dialogues, villain that only say stuff slowly and slam the keyboard, or family stuff, because that is just a vehicle for the movie to exist, so that they can lay waste to as many cars as possible. It is important that after watching too many movies, you just gotta turn your brain off and enjoy a dumb movie. And the later installments of this franchise is just what I need. Watching so many cars getting destroyed and blown up was crazy fun. The best scene was for sure the remote car control scene. It was ridiculous in all the entertaining way. Dwayne as Hobbs and Jason as Shaw were great as usual. I like both of them, and Dwayne displaying his alpha body was just great.

The first part of the movie was enjoyable and fun, but Gary Gray tends to drag it a little too much towards the end. It is obvious what was gonna happen and, honestly, I expected more fireworks and CGI magic.

I watched the extended edition of this film, which in my opinion was perfect (you can rent it for the same price on Amazon). The humor and action were really good in this movie, and I loved some of the twists and turns in this movie. While it could've been generic, as suggested by some of the trailers, this movie constantly stays unique IMO. While it is VERY over-the-top, it didn't feel nearly as stupid (in a bad way) as the last one.

Paul Walker's absence is felt throughout, but thankfully this isn't a major plot point and doesn't hold the film back from having fun. I appreciated that the writers took this film in a slightly (really very slightly) different direction by having some betrayal within the group. Dwayne Johnson finally feels utilized in this entry with far more screen time and humor than in predecessors. The physics in this one are outrageously unbelievable as always, but the stunts and set pieces are impressive. I was hesitant about Shaw's redemption arc at first, but it proved to be quite satisfying and effective.

Some people complain Tony is not in a suit enough and sure, but isn't that kind of the point?

703,Nathan D,"Sep 05, 2021","Iron Man 3 was such a joy to watch as there were so many great moments throughout the film. The script is solid and doesn't shy away from any aspects, which leads to a great viewing experience. The main villain of the movie is rooted, and his motives are clear. Is he the best villain? No, but he gets the job done. The character arcs in this film are so much better here than in the second installment. Tony grew as a person and was able to become a better person overall. If I had to nitpick the script, I think I would have toned down the political tones a bit. It began to be a lot at times which I think was unnecessary. Another thing was that it felt a bit predictable at times. Using the shady businessman for the third time in a row does get a bit repetitive. Shane Black does a stellar job directing this installment and is on par with Favreau's work on the first film. There were plenty of scenes that felt inventive and unique, making the film have very few dull moments. Even with the more serious scenes, it still had the emotion it needed to be entertaining. To accompany Black's directing is some solid cinematography from John Toll. There are a lot of shots that look very nice and have some significant elements to them. Sadly, those two aspects get brought down by the harsh editing in the film. The action sequences have too many cuts leaving the scenes to feel rushed and messy. There are even a few scenes where some cuts don't match up with the shot before. The score does make up for this as it keeps the energy up in some of the scenes. Composer Brian Tyler created this bombastic score that impacted the film profoundly. The production and set design are also very attractively done. Many visually appealing locations complimented Shane Black's vision quite nicely. The cast also does a fabulous job here with stand-outs all around. Like always, Robert Downey Jr. shines on screen. This performance is the most human he has felt in any of the three Iron Man movies as he and Black translated what was on the script to the screen very nicely. Gwyneth Paltrow continues to do great in the role of Pepper Potts. Although, her performance in Iron Man 2 is still the best out of the three movies. Ben Kingsley is outstanding here and created a lot of entertaining moments in the film. I can see why some people do not like his performance, but I thought he was a lot of fun. Guy Pearce is also a solid addition to the cast. His acting seems bland at times, and it does not help that his character is somewhat the same as the other two films in the franchise. Supporting cast members like Ty Simpkins, Rebecca Hall, and Don Cheadle are fantastic in the movie. Overall, Iron Man 3 is an action-packed blockbuster that is so enjoyable to watch. The film does have a few blemishes in the script and editing department. Yet, the entertainment factor helps hide it at times. An exceptional cast, an outstanding score, and marvelous directing make Iron Man 3 a stand-out film in Marvel's cinema catalog.

The villain is generic and forgettable, and the twist is rather insulting, especially to hardcore fans. The suit that makes Iron Man who he is comes off nigh-indestructible in every other Marvel film, now the thing just flies to pieces if he gets hit just a little too hard? And he spends less than a quarter of the movie in it. Wow, how inspiring. I get that they were trying to go for 'Iron Man is the MAN, not the armour', but it just falls apart.

709,Ethan T,"Aug 25, 2021","Iron Man 3 is an average popcorn superhero film saved by Downey Jr. in the lead role. His smarmy yet lovable Iron Man is always a sight to behold. The action alternates between a decent showcase of big-budget CGI and illogical messiness. Paltrow and Downey work well together and Don Cheadle and Paul Bettany (voice) seem to have fun. Simpkins is a rare likable child star, but the positives end there for the supporting cast. Guy Pearce brings all of the campiness and not much else for a villain. Ben Kingsley is very welcome in another villainous role but does little to justify his inclusion apart from a bit of hit and miss comic relief. The comic relief in general does not completely miss, but could be stronger and telegraphs much of its humour in advance. Rebecca Hall did alright, though it's another case of her not quite bedding into admittedly daft proceedings as with Transcendence.

But, someone did make a good point about Marvel making all of the villains in witty comedy pieces. It happened with Loki in ""Loki"" and ""Thor Ragnarok"", Zemo in ""The Falcon and The Winter Soldier"" and The Mandarine in ""Iron Man 3"". It isn't really the best ideas to make people who tried to kill everyone on the Earth best friends with the main characters. Robert Downey Jr. always puts out his best as Tony Stark. The Ironman franchise is one of my favorite trilogies in cinema history. I'm sad his story is over, but I am so happy about his character arc throughout the MCU.

732,Christian K,"Aug 19, 2021","Honestly it's difficult to choose which is the most deranged film I've seen this week, Being John Malkovich or Minions. Minions does feature a 'hypno-hat' which enables the wearer to hypnotise whoever is in front of them and take control of what they're doing. So there is a slight link between the two films there. I've only seen the first two Despicable Me films (2010/2013) and they're pretty decent; nothing groundbreaking but a nice idea played out well. Minions is arguably the most inevitable spin off movie in film history, and unsurprisingly there's a sequel due next year. The sensible route seemed to be using the film to tell a minion origin story, and the opening sequence that explains the minions route through the earth's timeline is good fun, telling us how they've always wanted to serve some terrible evil master. We know where the film will probably end, and sure enough, it does, but it's produced well enough to hold the attention span of children and adults alike, even pre-schoolers will preoccupied for ninety minutes (mine certainly was). It's also absolutely bonkers, and I think to make this work the producers had to double down on the madness (or double up if you will) which is exactly what they have done. A lot of it is set in London, and there's plenty of shots of people drinking tea, as well as an extended cameo from an animated Queen Elizabeth II. But I understand that this description might not sound anywhere near as insane as a Charlie Kauffman film.",Minions,Minions - Movie Reviews
733,Puroo R,"Aug 09, 2021","I had watched Despicable Me just to understand the memes and to get within the lines of the pop culture. I never understood the deal with the Facebook memes which have pictures of Minions in them and have quotes written next to them. So I used to think Minions always speak out funny one liners for the audience to have a quick laugh at. After watching Despicable Me I realised this was nothing but cheap publicity, but then I decided to watch the whole franchise anyway, and so here we are. After having watched the original trilogy, this one feels a step back, but that doesn't mean it isn't entertaining enough. Minions is a spin-off to the Despicable Me franchise (the name of the franchise is Despicable Me or Minions, I will never know). This tells the story of how the Minions found Gru and became his, well, minions. In the beginning the Minions were only wild animals who used to serve whoever was evil. They move on from one master to another, until they have none left. And that's when three Minions set out on an adventure - Bob, Kevin and Stuart (isn't it funny that they have English names even though they were born before humans existed?). The franchise has a really good animation style. It looks cute enough to be memorable, especially seeing the Minions take part in activities in the things they see for the first time. Even the action scenes of these movies are incredible. Scarlet Overkill being shown as a total badass and then getting her comeuppance made this movie so much fun to watch. Queen Elizabeth's mockery was also very funny, especially the part where one of the Minions tries to pull the sword out of the stone. The ending with Gru was also very unexpected and gave the movie a happy (?) ending. What this movie lacks in, however, is the storytelling. This is not a good movie, but rather a good ""enough"" movie. There's nothing in this which you haven't seen before. The plot is mostly predictable, many parts are very annoying to watch, especially Scarlet being a generic female villain who always wins with martial arts. Other than Queen Elizabeth and Herb there weren't any memorable characters. Herb was memorable and still I forgot his name. Minions is one of those movies I can imagine kids going crazy over, since the movie is targeted only for them. If you're an adult you will find this movie very childish. It's not like the Despicable Me trilogy which is fun for the whole family. It has just selected all the things which made the franchise marketable and went all out in showing them here, namely, Minions.",Minions,Minions - Movie Reviews

There are non-meaningful fights, like Bucky vs Black Panther, or even the airport scene in this film. But the final fight here between Cap & Iron Man is a meaningful fight—and simply sad, especially as Baron Zemo watches from a distance with pleasure. I'd much rather see villains fight against each other (Doctor Doom vs Magneto vs Ultron vs Loki vs Thanos vs Carnage, anyone?). What was cool was introducing Spider-Man and Black Panther, and going deeper into Vision & Wanda's relationship. The plot was generally fine (even if you were semi-familiar with the comics version of the plot) but the circumstances causing the final fight seemed contrived.

I really enjoyed this in Age of Ultron, and to SOME degree here, but the talking here seems artificial to promote the highlight of this film where each side poses before fighting the other side. The disagreement over the Sokovia Accords seemed just dumb, and both Tony and Steve seemed like they were on the flip side of where they should be. Really? Tony is going to not go save someone when a bureaucrat in Belgium tells him not to? I get character growth and guilt and all, but please.

That makes the movie almost impartial, which was a super-intelligent idea because everybody could be a villain. The action sequences are spectacular and the introduction to new characters added to the development of existent and returning ones are perfect. Tom Holland (Peter Parker/Spider-Man) and Chadwick Boseman (King T'Challa/Black Panther) are two of the best characters of this universe.

Pretty great cast with Patrick Wilson, Amber Heard, Dolph Lundgren, Willem Dafoe and Nicole Kidman. Probably ranks up there with Black Panther for most colourful movies.

Though the acting isn't great by any means, and the story is kind of generic, Aquaman is selling what is literally says on the tin; a bro-ish superhero, with fish-powers, must save the World from his evil brother, whose powers are similar to his. Aquaman isn't my favourite character by far in the cinematic universe, but he does stay true to his portrayal in the comics, unkempt and brooding with a few quips here and there. I liked him far more in a solo film than I did in Justice League, as it seemed too many of the team had similar attributes and he just didn't stand out. Black Manta, being one of my favourite comic book villains, was also excellently portrayed by Yahya Abdul-Manteen II. Aquaman works better than the previous films because it doesn't need a lot of exposition and time to get to the root of the story.",Aquaman,Aquaman - Movie Reviews

Luscious visuals, incredible special effects world, great supporting cast including Oscar winners Kidman and Defoe with many stellar performances. Biggest drawback was the female lead did not have the chops to keep up with Momoa nor the chemistry to hold the position of female lead and love interest! She was barely tolerable and that God-awful red wig... At least director Wan did not have her use a hideous British accent like in the Snyder cut of Justice League. Her poor acting and general vibe left a bad taste in otherwise great movies. But I digress, this is an Aquaman review. Aquaman is an over the top character that is bigger than life. Momoa takes a character that was made fun of for many years and makes him cool. He makes this superhero someone you want to hang out with, without needing to use his powers. Wan did a nice job showing Curry's early life and showed how he became the person we are following now. Long live Aquaman!

845,Cailan D,"Aug 06, 2021","Aquaman is one of my favorite films from James Wan and shows that the director is capable of handling multiple genres. Aquaman may not be the best movie we've seen in the DCEU, but it's by far the most fun and entertaining and has the most rewatch value. The visuals are phenomenal, the fight sequences are fantastic and the premise is pretty good too. The acting supplements all this really well; all the big actors do great jobs with their roles and Jason Momoa is a surprisingly good casting choice for Arthur Curry. This movie is a solid origin story for Aquaman that I only wish we'd had before the Justice League disaster so we could've had context for character upon seeing him in a big group setting, although the movie does play off of Curry's appearance in Justice League nicely. Patrick Wilson is a very welcome face in this movie for me and fans of the Insidious and Conjuring franchises and marks his 5th collaboration (I believe) with Wan. Wilson shows how good of an actor he is in this movie. I appreciate how this movie made good use of all it's big-name and A-list actors; it didn't squander any of them and gave an actor we haven't seen too much of before the film the spotlight a few times. I do wanna reiterate a point I made earlier now about the movie being fun. Aquaman struck a very different tone and mood than pretty much every other film in the DCEU; the other movies have been very serious or comedic, but haven't been so in ways that make them truly entertaining. Aquaman has a very different vibe from the rest of the DCEU, and it's a breath of fresh air. Aquaman wants to be a fun movie and succeeds in doing so, and it's a movie I could watch 5 or more times and still be entertained by, a luxury I don't personally have with any other film in the DCEU. All that said, Aquaman isn't a perfect movie, and it's biggest fault for me is the dialogue. It's really cheesy, cringey and corny at times and without the great performances from the actors some scenes would be really awkward, stupid and unwatchable. Some the actors, especially Patrick Wilson, have to be on their A-game to keep a straight face while they say their lines due to how ridiculous the dialogue is at times. Honestly, if the dialogue had been better, this movie probably would've been a perfect 10 for me since everything else about the movie works really well; the dialogue is something I hope they work on and refine in the sequel, which according to Wan started filming recently. Overall, Aquaman may not be perfect or the best movie in the DCEU but it's a fun, entertaining and action-packed movie and has some of the best rewatch value of the whole DCEU.",Aquaman,Aquaman - Movie Reviews

The infamous Minas Tirith battle scene, the heroics at the Black Gate, Arogorn's speech, the brotherhood between Legolas and Gimli, the corruption of Frodo by the Ring... it's just cinematic perfection and there may never be a movie series to rival LOTR, particularly not in the fantasy genre.

It adapts by far the worst source material of the three and really pays the price for it with one of the worst cases of deus ex machina in movie history (the ghosts); the director thankfully chose to excise the worst chapter of writing Tolkien ever produced, that being the Hobbits returning to the Shire to find that Saruman has taken it over, but a lot of the buildup to Frodo's eventual character-ruining refusal to destroy the ring was internal and wasn't conveyed in the movie. We are instead left with a protagonist (who had already become worthless halfway through the second movie) making a heel turn long after all respect for him had been lost. I think a few of the Oscar wins this received was based on accrued appreciation for the trilogy as a whole and a lack of significant competition in '03.

884,Puroo R,"Jun 22, 2021","This is my third and final review of the trilogy. In the first movie's review I called it an RPG game and mentioned on how the world building was done adn how great the visuals were. In the second review I said it was like watching a book come to life and talked about the character development and philosophy/message the movie gave. In this third review I have called it an art and here I will talk about the story and why it will be remembered not just as a masterpiece, but also as a legacy. Keep in mind that all the reviews have been written separately but all of them imply to all three movies. The Lord of the Rings is one long story that has been divided equally among three movies. Because of this there is virtually no major difference between the them, and all the three movies have received almost the same ratings. Normally in trilogies the stories do not directly pick up from where the last one left but rather these are three different stories, because of which it is possible to have two great movies and one movie which does not live up to them (Sam Raimi's Spider-Man, Christopher Nolan's Batman, the original Star Wars trilogy, Godfather etc), or there is one great movie while the other two don't live up to that (Zack Snyder's Superman, Star Wars prequel and sequel trilogies, Jurassic Park etc). Here the risk was much bigger. Since there is just one story, either the entire trilogy would have been good or the entire trilogy would have been bad. This is why the movies were so long. The story is set in a fantasy world and not everyone has read the original books by JRR Tolkien. So Peter Jackson had to elaborate every minor detail. There should have been no questions left. The audience should've had a clear idea of what they were watching. Normally such things are only possible in TV shows which are book adaptations like Game of Thrones or The Man in the High Castle since they have enough time in their hands to explain everything. This, however, was a movie series. This is the reason why the runtime is so long. The total runtime of the trilogy is 10+ hours, and 12+ hours if you watch the extended cut. Another major problem that could have plagued this movie, if it wasn't addressed, was the number of characters and the fact that all of them were in different places doing different things. There were some minor characters right in the beginning of the story and some in the middle. All of them had to be humanised, something which is possible only if we get to know more about them. Because of this the story is moved forward such that we are made to care about all of the people. While we ask what happened to Gimli and Legolas in the battle, we are also worried that Frodo has been tricked by Gollum and is about to be eaten by a giant spider. The direction does not shift in the bias of any of the characters, otherwise the ones the audience cares about would have been left behind. People often make fun of the half-hour long epilogue shown in the end of The Return of the King, but imagine if it was not there. So many characters would have received vague endings. This was meant to assure that all the good characters got good endings and the bad guys got bad endings. I'd also take a moment to talk about Gimli and Legolas' relation. In the beginning they both hated each other but later on they grow to become friends. This is another great message that the movie sends us. In my previous review of philosophy I didn't mention it because it was seen in this movie. It talks about how we hate some people based on their appearance, their beliefs, their way of life. But we end up becoming friends with those same people once we actually interact with them. People were never meant to hate each other. This is something we are taught to do. This is also seen when Aragorn unleases the Army of the Dead. They never wanted to work with the living because of their hatred, but when one of them came forward and made the request, they gave in. It is these small moments that show the humanity in all the characters. And finally, what makes it a legacy? Today everyone knows about The Lord of the Rings. Gandalf is the first thing someone imagines when they hear the word ""wizard"", in spite of there being a more popular book adaptation movie franchise which is literally about wizards. So many RPG games have their stories set in the manner of ""some characters with different abilities go out on a dangerous yet exotic adventure"". Elijah Wood has become world famous for his role as Frodo Baggins. Gollum, in spite of being the same annoying character found in all fantasy movies, is more popular than Jar Jar or Dobby. All of this is possible because of the way the story unfolds. Everyone who was evil was simply so because of the circumstances, and those who were good were because of how much the story emphasised on their actions. This coupled with great direction and a good world building made it so popular. The Lord of the Rings is one of the era defining movies of our times. It looks like a painting brought to life, one that we used to look at in fairy tales and nursery rhymes. It is the first thing that comes to someone's mind when they think of a fantasy adventure set in the medieval era. The patience of the creators and the fans is what made this trilogy so powerful. I really hope we get to see more such adaptations of books that we haven't heard about. This one has made a benchmark that will be hard to reach in the near future unless a miracle happens.",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - Movie Reviews
885,Big Mojo W,"Jun 09, 2021","Lord of the Rings: Return of the King is the best ending imaginable to this incredible trilogy. The characters continue to shine, most notably Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf and Aragorn in this movie. With the Battle of Helm's Deep won and Saruman dead, the stage is set for the final battle in this epic saga. Upon finding that Sauron plans to strike the city of Minas Tirith, the heart of Gondor, Gandalf and Pippin ride to the city only to find Denethor, a madman in control of the city who is totally unfit to be the Steward. Eventually, the forces of Gondor, Rohan, Eriador and Mordor all coincide at Minas Tirith for the largest and in my opinion, best battle not only in this saga, but in all of cinematic history. Every scene in this movie holds weight to it, it is my favourite in the trilogy and seeing Aragorn finally take his place becoming King of the Reunited Kingdom always brings a tear to my black heart. This movie, like every other in the trilogy is flawless and I will rewatch these movies until the day I die.",The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - Movie Reviews
886,Will C,"Jun 06, 2021",(Extended edition) I've always found this the weakest of the trilogy and it is also by far the worst of the extended editions. This suffers much more than The Two Towers from pointless additional scenes that add nothing to the film other than to bog down an already exceptionally long runtime. There's very few additions that I think make the film any better.

I had certain expectations and I suppose Homecoming helped me know what to expect from its sequel. With that in mind I really had a good time with this film. Its a fun small neighborhood film with a really good villain. They nailed Mysterio in the film. I loved how they portrayed his character and I loved his costume. I was surprised just how close they got to the comics with it. I am glad the days of trying to subdue or gritt-ify superhero costumes are somewhat over (still holding out for Wolverine to get his comic book costume). Ideas of certain superheroes are kind of goofy and so are the costumes. It's part of the fun. Certainly adapt so it doesn't look super goofy but don't destroy either. Overall I would recommend giving it a watch. Holland still isn't my ideal Spiderman, nor is his world, but I enjoy it for what it is. And I am so glad they got rid of Spiderman's AI voice.

The humor is still good enough, the action is done well, and Holland continues to play his role marvelously.

901,Felix L,"Nov 16, 2021","I have a lot to say. I am a huge Spider Fan a Huge MCU fan. The number of people that know Peter Secret identity is Outrageously high so it doesn't feel like watching a spider man story. The Whole Teenage movie Recipe Cliché. The Character Dialogue try to copy the one from the early marvel Iron man movie.. and fail because they have nothing to say to each other. The Teacher is the best part of the movie. The pitch meeting for this movie should have been very differently .. You think Peter can go back to a normal life after the event of Infinity War.. I know marvel wants to Elongate the story but darn it felt wrong. You know from the beginning who Misterio is.. So nothing is a surprise .. Kinda dum that Sony want to make a Misterio movie since sooo long. He's really not an interesting character. At least he was well played. Again to many love scene and goofy scene. We will we ever have a spider man movie without love scene that never ends ..i rather watch a 45 minute movie that is good than 2h movie that just pointless boring story with multiple plot hole just to insert character that you really don't care about. Fake Fury team look like the Nebucad Nezar team from Matrix and they are super Cringe .. Movie is dull make no sense . Do you really think the Skrull can be this Dum. Its like if Peter did not learn anything from all his adventure in the past few years. He has 0 sense of responsibility . Homecoming was the best Spiderman movie.. why did it turn this way Why did Peter gave Edith to Misterio ,,, And the END with J Jonas Alex Jones Jameson is simply ridiculous it made me lost all interest in the continuity because we all know what comes next.. Just like in the Infinity Saga (2012-13) in the comics. that will keep going on with dr strange / Happy Plus Aunt may = Cringe I seem to be alone to think that this was a bad representation of who Peter Parker is. But i own 9000+ comic book and I'm not living in USA so what do i know This is my least favorite MCU movie and i am serious. I gave one star for acting and cast because it was a good cast . and another star for the score BGM and FX.

917,Rafael R,"Oct 30, 2021","Compared to this movie, Spider-Man: Homecoming is on another level. Far From Home is in general a decent film, but the two most important parts are bad-written: the protagonist and the villain. Tom Holland's Peter Parker involuted, becoming an idiot teenager who wants to run away from his responsibilities to conquer the girl he likes. Where is the guy who wants to prove himself? The guy who wants to be more than the neighbourhood friend? And Mysterio's plan and motivations don't make any sense. Luckily, he's imposing and Jake Gyllenhall is a stunning actor. The humour is more basic and less intelligent, but almost as efficient as Homecoming. And what elevates the level of this film is the third act, which is for sure one of the best acts in the whole MCU. The visual effects are amazing (by the way, the movie plays with them smartly) and the final fight is MCU's best individual fight (only one hero against the villain). Tom Holland and Zendaya's romance may seem forced, but it makes sense, they have chemistry and fortunately, the script kept MJ's cynical personality. No other character but Peter has been distorted.

979,Stefan Z,"Nov 11, 2021","Ah yes The Dark Knight one that turns into Home Alone. It's got a sprinkle of mission impossible too, but it's more known for being The Dark Knight that turns into Home Alone. All the The Dark Knight stuff are great. I am a huge Batman fan and absolutely hate Joker especially his oversaturation in the DC universe, but in this he actually works as the main villain. The score, directing, and cinematography are all fantastic. Deakins did unnecessarily use yellow more than need, but fantastic otherwise. It's when the film turns into Home Alone that I have trouble suspending my disbelief. Silva exposed all double-0 agents, but 007 because he was presumed dead, But MI6 have only 9 field agents? Where are the single-0s? If there were ever a time bond would NEED to work with someone else it would at the Skyfall property. Some snipers in the off distance trees, some in the house, another in the DB5 (that unfortunately was destroyed... again. I hate when movies think it's ok to destroy timeless cars). Some other times in other Bond movies I think ""maybe this would have been better with another double-0 by his side, perhaps not"". In this one I'm thinking ""bring in the cavalry"". Yes, I get it, they can't trust anyone especially how M's bodyguard of 15 years tried to kill her in Quantum of Solace, but then why trust Bond? He was presumed dead for how long, not know how much he's changed or feels betrayed still about her practically shooting him and doesn't know how much Silva's word affected him AND even acknowledges how little she knows if Bond is being influenced by Silva by abruptly feeling the need to stop and explain her actions involving Silva. I am also not really a fan of the film constantly asking the audience if the franchise is relevant, particularly M's scenes in the courts. Every single EON productions James Bond film, all 25 of them, have made money, even with new actors in the protagonist role where customers are not used to the new shoes yet, those sometimes make even more than the last one of the previous actor. Skyfall itself grossed over a billion dollars in 2012. So to answer the redundant question, yes, it's relevant. There also are some weird plot holes involving Silva. How exactly did he know the train was going to come through the wall when it did or how did he plan to kill M years in advance when the hearing was only set up 3 days beforehand. However, this and Casino Royale (2006) are the only Bond films where James gets character development, so that is a plus. I'm torn. Not a fan of those to particular writing things, the Home Alone part being a bigger deal for me really, but man, even though I spent like a sentence or two on the positives, they do really boost up the overall quality. The cold open, the fight against the sniper in the skyscraper, and the subway (tube) foot chase are some of the best action set pieces in Hollywood history. The tense gripping atmosphere of the mystery behind who is is hacking in MI6 before the villain is revealed is absolutely expert filmmaking. I do really think the positives outweigh the negatives here.",Skyfall,Skyfall - Movie Reviews

993,Nathan D,"Oct 10, 2021","Skyfall is an incredible movie with many astonishing aspects that make this film feel like a genuine spy thriller. Sam Mendes does a magnificent job directing this movie, as he creates this obscure yet exciting tone throughout the whole screen duration. The solid script helps support Mendes' vision with a prominent central story. Skyfall nailed down the story perfectly, as this is the first Daniel Craig Bond movie to feel like the world of a spy. Both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace struggled to capture the elements of a James Bond. However, the screenwriters perfected it here in this movie. Having the central storyline being an attack on MI6 while mixing in some of the personal elements of the characters is excellent for this franchise. Where the script falls flat was the misuse of the Bond girl. The poor treatment of Sévérine is very noticeable throughout the film and makes Skyfall suffer significantly. It is not necessarily wrong to not have a Bond girl, but to have one and completely butcher her character arc is wrong. Skyfall is visually stunning, with the exquisite cinematography stealing the spotlight at times. Roger Deakins does an extraordinary job here as the director of photography. Many shots were remarkable and captured the worldbuilding exquisitely. The editing is also the most potent of the first three installments. There are a few scenes with slightly choppy editing, but it is not as detrimental as the first two films. The score is also very compelling as it elevates a lot of the scenes. Thomas Newman knows how and when to make the music match sonically with what is on screen. The cast of Skyfall is strong, with a lot of great performances all around. Daniel Craig is smooth and has a lot of fun quips that make this movie special. While he may be exceptional in the role, his performance in Casino Royale edges his performance here just by a bit. Javier Bardem is phenomenal in this film and had the best performance out of everyone. The emotion Bardem put into creating Silva was comprehensive, and Bardem never overacts in any of his scenes. Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw are both prominent in their respective roles. They each stand out in all the sequences their characters are present in. Lastly, there is Judi Dench, who knocks it out of the park. It is Dench's most excellent performance in all the Bond films, as we really get to spend time with the character and not just see her tell people to eliminate the enemies. Dench still keeps that aspect alive in her performance, as it is an influential aspect of M's character arc. However, it never becomes too over-the-top. Skyfall is the complete embodiment of James Bond as the film holds every aspect a spy thriller needs to be a great film. The story is easy to follow yet has this slight complexity to it that still makes it shocking. The cast is perfect, with no bad actors bringing down the film. What does bring down the film is a messy subplot that looms its gloomy shadow over the film. If it were not for that terrible treatment of Sévérine, the film would have been perfect.

She was charming and fun. I loved them both in Knives Out. It appeared Craig was enjoying this segment as much as I. I personally don't think any Bond movie should end like this and I actually regretted watching this outing.

1005,Lequisha S,"Oct 05, 2021","The Dark Knight of the Craig Bond films. Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins offer by far the best cinematography for a Bond film. You like that shot of the burning city in 1917? They got you covered with Bond's family estate. You like that shot in Shang-Chi of them fighting against the backdrop of neon advertisement billboard? They got you covered. Like the meditative wide shots of the landscapes in 2049? Oh do they have you covered in Macau. Like Adele? Covered. This film challenges Bond in a way no other film has. He's weary, battered, and no longer as fit for superspy espionage as he was in his earlier years. But the one woman who has been a constant in his hectic life, his boss and surrogate mother figure, and the person who gave the ""take-the-shot"" order than made Bond end up in the drink, Judi Dench's M is at risk. The best bond villain to date, Javier Bardem's Anderson Silva, is not trying to take over the world. He's got a personal vendetta against the one person Bond has any real attachment to. What's more, he's a dark mirror to Bond. A former 00 and M's previous favorite, Silva was the Bond before Bond who also suffered from ""mother's"" decision to prioritize the mission over the agent. He's not only a formidable foe for Bond, but he's an effective foil. This is also the best fusion of the modern, gritty, grounded Bond and the gadget-laden, seductive, classy elements of early Bond. It pays homage to hallmarks of the olden days (Moneypenny, Q, etc.) yet breaks new ground (we visit Bond's home, we change M's, etc.) This is truly prestige bond.

Skyfall brings the stakes higher as everything seems to be collapsing hence the title. In here Daniel Craig continues to shine as James Bond and here is directly paired with Judy Dench as M as M16 is attacked by a powerful villain. The chemistry between the two is wonderful almost as a mother and son relationship and Craig faces his most challenging antagonist until this point Silva played by academy award winner and spanish actor Javier Bardem. Bardem kills this performance and brings a similar aurora to that he brought to No Country for Old Men. Bardem is psychotic, mild mannered, and out for revenge in one of his most iconic roles. Lots of great action here as always but is the drama between the characters and the great relationship between M and Bond that makes this movie so incredible to watch with a climax that keeps on the edge. With Adele singing in the intro, great direction by Mendez, a great script, and an incredible performance by Javier this movie is almost a masterpiece.",Skyfall,Skyfall - Movie Reviews

1020,Puroo R,"Aug 08, 2021","Looking at the poster and trailer of this movie I was thinking this might be something really good. I had recently watched the first three movies of this franchise and I really liked the whole concept of Transformers; just seeing them do something on the big screen is enough to get my attention. So when I heard that this is the worst movie of the franchise, the robot dinosaur poster refused to let me believe that. How can a movie with such a good CGI possibly be bad? And when I watched it... I now apologise to all those people I didn't trust. I'm really sorry. The problem with this movie is that it has humans. I know, Transformers are all about Autobots and humans interacting and coming together to beat Decepticons, but the humans in this movie are terrible. I forgave Dark of the Moon since it was Sam Witwicky, the same guy we had previously seen in two prequels. But this time, it's the new guy. I don't even remember his name, so let's just call him Mark Wahlberg. Mark is such a two dimensional character. He loves mechanical engineering and hates anyone approaching his daughter. Yes, that's his entire personality. So when Optimus Prime ends up coming to his lab, they bond together. The premise of this movie is all wrong. The Autobots are now considered criminal in this world because of the destruction that happened in the previous movie. Like, what? Dude, even the army was doing destruction in the previous movie if that's supposed to be a real reason. Also everyone saw the Autobots fight the Decepticons in the epic climax moment. And it's not like there's some communication gap between the Autobots and the humans, since Optimus Prime literally lived with the military. So if there's any problem at all, they can just talk about it. So anyway Optimus helps Mark, his daughter and her boyfriend escape from there, and they team up with Hound and some other Transformers (I don't even remember the names at this point, because they don't give a reason to do so). Together they go to The Lost World where Optimus fights the robot T-Rex for which I watched this movie in the first place. First of all, the T-Rex is like, five times bigger than Optimus Prime. For comparison, just try fighting an elephant with your bare hands (except that elephants are herbivores and won't attack you unprovoked). And after the beating that T-Rex becomes friends with Optimus because it's a Michael Bay movie. So then there's the epic showdown battle between Mark and some bad guys. I was doing my college project on my laptop and this movie was running on my phone's Prime Video, so I used to only look at the movie whenever something interesting would be happening, otherwise I'd just keep doing my work. I don't think I looked at the screen more than 3-4 times throughout the work. This is the reason why I can guarantee you that it's a boring movie. I don't remember most of it. Transformers: Age of Extinction is the movie that taught me that Transformers could be bad too. Earlier I used to see Screen Rant articles which said that after a time the movies went repetitive with the CGI fighting and explosions, so I didn't understand what's bad about it since that's literally what I watch them for. But it turns out the reason why I hate it is the other way round. The big, cool robots have now turned into parodies of themselves and the humans are no longer even close to being interesting. I'd say if you haven't begun watching this franchise, just watch the first three and then jump straight to Bumblebee. That would save a lot of time and inner peace.",Transformers: Age of Extinction,Transformers: Age of Extinction - Movie Reviews

The new Transformers are fun as well, whether it be the snarky Crosshairs, the serious Drift, or the violence loving Hound. This movie is a new start, and a good one at that.

The score once again is very amazing. It makes a good moment into a nearly perfect moment. The story is not complicated and if anything its too basic. The action like every Transformers movie is GREAT. It also is probably the most kid friendly Transformers movie out of all of them. This or TLK. The humans aside from Cade are pretty bland and just, ""Eh."" Lockdown is great though. He might be better than Megatron. He is very powerful and pretty cool looking. Some of the shots in this movie are insane. But another problem is how long this movie is. I feel like it could have been done in a one hour and forty five minutes movie. Like every other Transformers movie its pretty stupid. The dinobots were pretty cool. but they could have come sooner. Lockdowns ship is very cool. Crosshairs, Drift, and Hound are all ok additions to the cast. They kill off an important Transformer in the beginning which sucked. It helps show how powerful Lockdown is though. This movie is like a cake. You eat it and it tastes pretty good. You think to yourself that you would it the cake again in like half a year. You do and it tastes just as good.

1060,Jeff B,"Oct 29, 2021","Jeff Barnes 8/28/21 The Dark Knight Rises Review The Dark Knight Rises enables you to be absorbed while watching it with: symbolism advising you to pay attention, intrigue, a moral that teaches us persistence. Batman in The Dark Knight Rises plans to save Gotham City from a terrorist named Bane with the help of Catwoman. Catwoman is perhaps the most captivating character in the picture. Catwoman is a thief, but she believes she's being a thief for a good reason. She tells Bruce Wayne that she, like Robin Hood, steals from the rich to give to the poor. She is so full of mystery we wonder why does she feel like she must steal to get what she wants? I's probably because she enjoys being sneaky and manipulative. She does it because she sees a lot of fun in it. Catwoman believes you should take what you see because you only live once, and that you should seize the moment. Catwoman is an insecure woman who's not sure if she wants good or evil in the world. There is a scene in the film where Catwoman a/k/a Selina Kyle sees a picture of a family and realizes that the place that has been demolished and spoiled was someone's home, and her friend Holly says ""now it's everyone's home. This is what you wanted a storm is coming."" Selina then looks dismayed and unassured as if she seems to be comprehending that maybe evil isn't as pleasant as it seems. One of the most powerful moments in The Dark Knight Rises if not the most powerful moment is when there are an army of policeman running towards an army of criminals shooting at each other, and this represents a war between law and crime. The Dark Knight Rises like the previous Christopher Nolan Batman films has a main theme and it's persistence. The occasions that most notably represent persistence is when Bruce Wayne is thrown in exile when he's thrown into a pit where men suffer, and he's determined to get out. Wayne realizes that climbing out of the pit takes persistence because he figures out that only one person made it out. He also grasps that he and Batman have a whole lot of endurance as well more than you can imagine. He's still willing to climb out of the pit despite only one person having done it successfully. Before Wayne successfully climbs out of the hole, he sees Bats coming out of the walls and this symbolizes that he truly is Batman. The film that shows that Batman is willing to have so much persistence that he's willing to be selfless by risking his life to save others at the end. Christopher Nolan brings a satisfying conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy with: persistence, theme, morals, symbolism, and intrigue.",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews

1069,ggavwva a,"Sep 30, 2021","Sep 21, 2021 This review contains spoilers. the filmmaking in The Dark Knight Rises is nothing short of masterful, and stands above the other two in the franchise, especially from a cinematography, production design, and art direction standpoint. Not to say ‘Begins' and especially ‘Knight' were lacking, because they were crafted to astoundment, but ‘Rises' just took it a step further, especially with the sound, and the fact that it didn't get nominated for either sound mixing or editing is a straight up insult to the film, and goes to show The Academy was only concerned with the politics of the shooting that year rather than the merit of the actual film, which was fantastical. On a technical level, it's **** amazing. It deserved a cinematography, production design, SCORE, sound editing, and sound mixing, and visual effects nomination and there's no **** denying that. The production design and art direction were more layered and complex than the past few films. The cinematography did seem a bit more modest than ‘Knight"" but it still succeeded at giving us some haunting and memorable images and composition that really fit the more somber and hopeless tone of the film, instead of the fiery orange and blues that bolded the presence of chaos in ‘Knight"". The score may have taken track basis' from Begins, but it restated them and added much more variety and emotional power and timing to the film. The sound design isn't even an argument, and while the visual effects were actually pretty minimal for the part of a lot of them being practical, that still should've given it enough to grasp a nomination over ugly bland CGI **** like The Avengers and that Hunstman movie. I mean come **** on, those two movies have some of the ugliest color palettes and uninspired VFX I've ever seen. In a less competitive year, it easily could have gained a supporting actor nomination for Michael Caine, because he added a whole extra layer of emotional depth to the film with his performance, and boy he really got it out in those few scenes. it gave me a feeling I haven't really felt in any other movie, bringing tears to my eye. And no, he wasn't not in it enough. Check Hal Holbrook for Into the Wild. He was in that movie for a very short time, but gave enough of a performance to get a nomination. Same type of deal. With very similar roles, actually. Despite being the best, most relevant, and most well made film of the year, and even one of the best of the decade, Adapted Screenplay, Picture, and Director were extremely unfavorable for the simple fact that the Academy can't see past ""Batman"" and because it wasn't getting anything more than its predecessor did. I can go on and on and analyze all the relevant and subtle political themes and philosophical depth that is beautifully mixed in with honest and emotionally resonating heroism, postmodern ambivalence, and themes of pain, corruption, and personal crisis and struggle, but it's not that important to this topic. People are too busy nitpicking **** that doesn't even matter (and can easily be debunked) anyway. The fact of the matter to this question is that it was ungratefully and unreasonably snubbed from the technical categories simply for the fact of the Aurora shooting. There is no other answer. The Academy didn't want to glorify a film that ""represented"" such a tragedy. The Dark Knight Rises is one of the most gritty and beautiful films ever made, and from a technical standpoint, it is one of the absolute greatest next to its predecessor. It deserved at least 2 or 3 nominations for sure at the very least. **** the Academy for putting politics over actual filmmaking merit.

The movie is exemplary in its use of editing and sound, they complement each sequence in the film perfectly and set the atmosphere for the film. Tom Hardy is almost unrecognisable as Bane. I believe it was a great performance. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman is a complete scene stealer and the dynamic scenes between Christian Bale's Batman and her Catwoman are well done.

1075,Hhhh V,"Sep 01, 2021","Where to begin. It starts out with an absolute bang. Another movie to the trilogy, another extremely badass, villain of the century introduced. Bane is intimidating, ruthless, badass, a myth; everything a great villain should be: pure evil. We immediately are hooked to the story that continues unraveling through the next parts of the movie. We get to see yet another deep and dark interpretation of Bruce Wayne/The Batman. Once again, Christopher Nolan flawlessly executes the complexity of the character and gives us so much more than just that. We see Wayne using his fears, his pain, his suffering to overcome those very things and rise above. We see our beloved Alfred giving his all to what can only be described as his father-son relationship with Bruce. We see new characters appear for the first time, such as the talented burglar, Catwoman, who also gets a very deep character and personality behind the mask. We get to see a mere cop, who gives his city his all, and risks his very life for the great good, representing a symbol of pure goodness. Not a single moment throughout this movie that makes you feel bored or not entertained. It's filled with amazing CGI; next level story-telling; suspense to keep you at your toes; character development that makes you connect to them in a way you never have before. You can literally feel the pain Bruce is going through, you can literally feel his journey to overcoming it.

1077,Janjz Z,"Aug 29, 2021","Aug 21, 2021 i just rewatched this film for the first time in a few years and boy was it much better than i remembered. this film offers a new look at gotham compared to the dark, gritty criminal underworld present in the first two films. we can see a gotham that has prospered in the last few years, moving out of the darkness both figuratively and literally. most of the scenes in this movie are set in broad daylight, which is a refreshing change from the last two entries. tom hardy is excellent as Bane in this movie. he is the first villain in this series that truly feels like an unstoppable force. the moment where the whole plan comes together, the cops are trapped underground and bane declares anarchy on the football field was chilling and was the first time i felt as though there were real stakes from a villain. i do find miranda tate being the true villain an excellent twist. she is Bruce's reckoning, a cultivation of everything he has done and him quite literally facing his past dealings with the league of shadows and the consequences of his never ending work to protect gotham. i do wish they'd built up her relationship with bruce a bit more, though, as their romance did seem to come out of nowhere, but in the end it made the twist even more jaw dropping. this movie is long, and there is a LOT going on, but for the most part the pacing is pretty good. there were definitely parts that could've been cut out, this film suffers from agonisingly long and boring car chases like the dark knight does. other than that there isn't much i would change about this movie. anne hathaway is also spectacular in this movie and was very enjoyable to watch. i found myself enjoying every scene she was in and we get to see her grow from the selfish to the selfless across the movie. this movie also features great performances all round. out of the main ensemble i can't say there are any weak performances. my favourite scenes would have to be the ones of bruce in the pit. he is quite literally reborn there and the harrowing chants of the prisoners as someone attempts to climb is something that i always remembered from the first time i watched this movie. this movie excels at being the end of the trilogy - batman's final mission. with the highest stakes ever, and one of the most impressive villains i have ever seen in a superhero movie, it's an enjoyment to watch from start to finish. And in the final scene where we see the plane fly off with the bomb and batman inside it we are quite literally seeing the death of batman. bruce may still be alive but he has hung up the cape, and the batman died along with the bomb leaving a beautiful well-wrapped ending to one of the best trilogies of all time. i don't see much point making more batman movies after these ones, they are hard to flaw are greatly celebrated even today. afflecks batman wasnt great, but he still feels like he stands in the shadow of Bale, which i also worry will happen to Pattinson once ""The Batman"" releases. after rewatching the remarkable ending to a franchise it has got me thinking about how future movies can compete, and in my opinions batman should be left to rest for now. the dark knight rises is the perfect fulfilling ending to batman and his story",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews
1078,Vghh H,"Aug 26, 2021","Aug 21, 2021 Not only is this the most intelligent Nolan film, really getting you to work as you watch the villain's plan unfold before you and the heroes, but it is also the most powerful in storytelling and moving the audience. Already you have the groundwork laid out from the previous film 'The Dark Knight' to follow up with Batman, running from the police who now has to tackle a new threat. It could not be done in a more mind-shattering and brilliant way. Bane's character, while seemingly a bit generic, quickly makes you realize how much you've taken him for granted when learning more about his backstory. Every time he walks on the screen he has a presence. I would say the same for the Joker, but he's been unfortunately memed too much for me to take him 'so serious' anymore. The way in which Bruce must rise again from the pit truly felt inspiring, and how he climbed out without the rope, the safety which he had always throughout the previous films. To me, that rope was symbolic of everyone he had with him throughout the films. Alfred, Rachel, and Dent as well. Now he had lost them all to the very same symbol which he crawls back to every night. He still finds the courage to put it on one last time. This time especially, I felt extremely interested in all other subplots in the movie. Gone was the fun but slightly stale 2000s grain and the lower mm cameras. This really plays up the aesthetic which Gotham is, and also allows for Gotham City to feel breathed in, as though people are really walking through it. This is something I never truly feel in any other Batman series or adaptation. To say this is the best Batman movie is an understatement. This really is the peak of Nolan's filmmaking for me. Everything from the acting, choreography, the score, and much more is such a step up from both predecessors. It never ceases to amaze me how much effort must have gone into this film.

This is going to be like a combo of my review of the movie and just my general thoughts on the trilogy as a whole but in both regards it deserves nothing but the highest praise. Such a brilliant display of everything from audio-visual work to narrative structure and characterization this trilogy really does it all. The score was absolutely outstanding from beginning to end and in this movie I felt like the score did so much to amplify all of the scenes regardless of what was happening. The dialogue was amazing, iconic one liners and more subtle conversations that carry so much emotional weight it doesnt feel like a single line is wasted at any point which is extremely difficult to do. The cast is so well done, can we just talk about how this one trilogy has some of the best protagonists antagonists and side characters in all of fiction? Every character arc was explored and developed to its fullest from beginning to the end, characters that are introduced in one movie get the proper amount of development necessary to flesh out every aspect and ultimately creates some of the most iconic performances in all of media. This movie had that in spades, in particular it had a lot of really good development for Commissioner Gordon who was already one of my favorite characters in the trilogy but this cemented it for me. My favorite character in this movie in particular was Catwoman for sure, she served as a super interesting counterbalance for Batman acting as sort of a more self-serving out for herself version of him and god damn was it fun to watch. Amazing performance Anne Hathaway absolutely killed it, its honestly kinda nuts how well she fit the role imo. Bane was another really interesting character, had some great dialogue, and his characterization was really well done. I think one of the main themes of this trilogy is the idea of chaos and how it brings out the worst in people, and Bane is a fantastic device used to explore this idea. I think The Joker was the better device through which this was explored but like I think thats being a little bit unfair so its whatever, both are fantastic in their own rights. Also this ending might be one of the best most conclusive most satisfying endings to anything that I have ever watched or read, everything fit perfectly into place, I just wanted to see my boy Bruce happy and thats exactly what we got, the ending had me straight up crying it was so good. I came to become so invested in these characters over the course of these movies and it feels so good to see this trilogy end in such a beautiful way. This trilogy is absolutely goated in every way, shape and form, Christopher Nolan is a genius.,I'm not even mad that we didn't get any more it's absolutely perfect. Truly one of the best universes in all of media, I honestly don't even know what else to say other than the fact that its brilliant The Dark Knight Rises: 9.5/10 Goated, absolutely fucking goated. This is going to be like a combo of my review of the movie and just my general thoughts on the trilogy as a whole but in both regards it deserves nothing but the highest praise. Such a brilliant display of everything from audio-visual work to narrative structure and characterization this trilogy really does it all. The score was absolutely outstanding from beginning to end and in this movie I felt like the score did so much to amplify all of the scenes regardless of what was happening. The dialogue was amazing, iconic one liners and more subtle conversations that carry so much emotional weight it doesnt feel like a single line is wasted at any point which is extremely difficult to do. The cast is so well done, can we just talk about how this one trilogy has some of the best protagonists antagonists and side characters in all of fiction? Every character arc was explored and developed to its fullest from beginning to the end, characters that are introduced in one movie get the proper amount of development necessary to flesh out every aspect and ultimately creates some of the most iconic performances in all of media.

1083,Jim T,"Aug 18, 2021","There's a lot of good in this film still. But it has neither as strong of a plot as Batman Begins or the stupendous fun of the Dark Knight. The climax is well done, but leaves unanswered still the question of whether Gotham can truly be saved, undermining the final product. Batman rides off into the sunset, but it is unclear that he has actually changed the city much for good - it still appears that it is only the same small group of individuals in the city who care for the city's character - not what Bruce Wayne took the mantle of Batman to do. Sure, he beats the bad guys in this battle, but he leaves the war while it's still being fought.

1086,Vhbg H,"Aug 13, 2021","Aug 9, 2021 Now this is how you close off an epic trilogy successfully! The Dark Knight Rises is the third and concluding chapter to Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, and is what I consider to be, a grand fitting end to the Christian Bale Batman/Bruce Wayne story arc. Released in 2012 to tremendous box office and critical reception, The Dark Knight Rises managed to become the highest grossing Batman film of all time, surpassing the hefty financial gain of The Dark Knight (2008), and still bares that title to this day. The Dark Knight Rises also has a few criticisms drawn from fans and critics alike, despite its mainly universal appraisal. Luckily for me, I'm not one of these hateful naysayers that hold any vice against this film. Drawing inspiration from various Batman comics storylines, such as ""Knightfall,"" ""No Man's Land,"" and ""The Dark Knight Returns,"" The Dark Knight Rises manages to convey an engaging and effectively entertaining plot that's jampacked with numerous allusions, homages, colossal themes, and most importantly, a gratifying and emotionally powerful conclusion. Christopher Nolan really outdid himself with this production. Not only do we get a phenomenal plot, but we get phenomenal choreographed action sequences and intense visuals. The special effects alone are a treat to the eyes!! Christian Bale is remarkable in his final performance as Bruce Wayne, bringing us a battle-hardened, broken hero who must rise past his broken spirit (and broken physical limitations thanks to Bane and previous fights) in order to save Gotham City from total nuclear destruction. Familiar faces aiding him such as characters portrayed by Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman bring their A-game in their final roles also. Newcomer Joseph Gordon Levitt does great as cop John Blake. And Marion Cotillard delivers an alluring, mystifying dual-identity role as Miranda Tate/Talia Al Ghul. But it's fellow newcomers Tom Hardy and Anne Hathaway that really stand out. The Bane we get in this movie is a lot different than the remedial one we get in Batman And Robin (1997); this new one portrayed greatly by Tom Hardy feels almost ripped straight from the comic books: an intelligent mountain of a man, who poses as both a physical and intellectual threat to Batman. Behind Heath Ledgers groundbreaking performance of The Joker, he's my favorite Batman villain in Nolan's trilogy. Anne Hathaway portrays Selina Kyle/Catwoman, a professional cat burglar, grifter, and femme fatale who develops a relationship with Bruce Wayne/Batman. She manages to evoke the sense of who Catwoman really is, and does such a great performance, she rivals Michelle Pfeifer's take on the character in Tim Burton's Batman Returns (1992). Lest we forget the intricate and meticulously well-shot 70mm IMAX cinematography? Or Han Zimmer's delightfully haunting musical score? Or every sliver of a detail perfectly synchronised to make connection and reference to the entire trilogy as a whole? No, lest us not forget. I still choose The Dark Knight as my favorite of Nolan's brilliant Dark Knight Trilogy, as well as my favorite comic book adapted film of all time; but The Dark Knight Rises will blow you away regardless",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews

The symbolism of the ending ends the trilogy off perfectly.",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews
1089,Ghhh b,"Aug 09, 2021","The dark moral of a corrupt political climate that The Dark Knight Rises shows through Gotham's grief is really excellent when the perspective is put on the issue. With Bane's ever lasting commitment to pulling off pain in the city, and Miranda's morality with her revenge it sets off a never ending stream for the tone of the film to follow along. Then Bruce wanting to be his own nation ""per say"" and do it without the willingness of others around him. Focusing on the complexities of the film is what I loved during this rewatch. Half of the dark blend of Nolan's direction and the surrounding technicals are what send this film off another level. With each of his films he keeps that dark tone and hits a nerve on the edge of your seat with every picture he makes. With each shot he focuses his time on making it make sense and capturing the message and/or symbolism of the scene. I don't really talk about it that much because it never turned to conversation but honestly the greatest scene in this film is the Star Spangled Banner Scene. The symbolism of that is so impressive. Your honestly watching one of the most messed up scenes in the history of Cinema. By using that song in the angelic voice of that young child symboled the freedom Gotham felt, but we as an audience no good and well it's not. And the feel of the scene is so damn intense. I always notice that it's only the kid singing, noticing that nothing else is happening except the anthem of freedom being used as the last thing to be heard before that feeling of freedom is stripped away entirely. Bane then going on to say ""that's a lovely, lovely voice"" knowing good and well he's about to kill that symbol of freedom singing the anthem of freedom. After that scene the third act takes off and the film gets nothing but brilliant. The technical blend as well deals with the more explosive side of visual effects. They go so well with the film it's hard to take your eyes off. The character of Bane has to be the best part about this film. Not only is he so **** misused in other DC properties and gets his rightful spotlight, but Tom Hardy's ability to make such an evil character and use that flow of darkness that Bane is so viscously proves that Christopher Nolan can be a director to take risk, and that arc of doing all of this for Miranda was pretty much a great twist. And I'd just say I recognize the hate that Miranda gets for her twist of being the head mastermind and not Bane, but I honestly think that the writers so greatly used their minds to convincingly show why she was the one behind it. Overall, The Dark Knight Rises should go in the all time books, and be shown as a way to tell a unique perspective on political corruption.",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews
1090,Jsnna S,"Aug 05, 2021","The casting is still great. The gravitas of Oldman Caine and Freeman just add so much weight and levity to characters which could not have been anything special. Tom Hardy is excellent as Bane and I love the way they shoot scenes to make Hardy seem larger then he actually is. He is almost the representation of pure evil and is the definition of intimidating. His famous 'I will break you' line from Batman Knightfall in 1993 has lived on to one of my favourite comic series and I love the soft adaptation that it gets. Selina Kyle contributed to some of my development in this movie in the same way that Carrie Fisher as slave Leia contributed too many children's development. Marion Cotillard is good as Tate but probably the weakest actor as she gets really cheesy towards the end. It's ironic as she is one of the better actors as a whole but doesn't always bring it for this movie. The most underrated performance though comes at the hand of the main actor and Bale knocks it out of the park again. Probably his best performance in any of these movies. The action is easily the best in any of the Dark Knight trilogy. Its funny ironically however as it means that Catwoman has some of the best action. The jewel in the crown though is Batman vs Bane in the sewers which is so cool. Speaking of which this is one of those extremely quotable movies due to Bane. My favourite is easily 'oh you think darkness is your ally, but you merely adopted the dark. I was born in it Moulded by it, I didn't see the light until I was a man, by then it was nothing to me but blinding'. This all combines to make one of my favourite scenes when Batman escapes the pit and as a detail I love the bats coming out just before he jumps. Very rich plot. Its my favourite type of plot as if you are barely focusing on it you still get everything that happens but if you really focus you pick up every minute detail and I love those sorts of plots so much. The cameos also really surprise me as I didn't expect Scarecrow to rock up the first time I watched it. It's also miraculously well directed. Nolans over the city shots alongside his practical work, work wonders to create a realistic but also extravagant movie. His cinematography is also fantastic. It also continues the trend in his films to sometimes not have a concrete ending and in my opinion that works better. 10/10 I have no faults.",The Dark Knight Rises,The Dark Knight Rises - Movie Reviews

1095,haley W,4d ago,"The film, the Joker, is about Arthur Fleck. For a living, Arthur works as a clown who deals with mental illness. He lives in Gotham City with his elderly mother and must take care of her. Arthur is constantly mistreated by society which is present throughout the film. When his social worker tells him he won't be able to get his medication anymore because the government is shutting them down to save money, this creates a major impact on Author and other citizens in Gotham who deal with mental health problems. This film has caused controversy because some believe it could give people ideas of mass shootings. The movie did not motivate mass shootings. It also did very well in theaters and many people, even if they don't know anything about DC Comics, really enjoyed the film. The Joker also had a very successful box-office run and won awards. The twists and surprises in this movie make it worthwhile and will have the audience on the edge of their seats. The opening scene of the Joker sets a dark tone for the rest of the movie. It shows how society treats people like Arthur and makes the viewer feel bad for him. Joaquin Phoenix who plays Arthur, was an incredible choice for this role. Joaquin's movements, emotions, and laugh really made the viewers sympathize with him as well as really helped the Joker come to life. The card Arthur must give to those who are confused why he is laughing is significant. This was a great way to introduce Joker's iconic laugh to the audience and to the citizens of Gotham city. A significant action Arthur does in the beginning of the movie is using his fingers to make himself smile while in clown make up. The reason this is important is because he is putting on a mask to make it seem like he is happy but, on the inside, he is struggling. Later it shows Arthur in his apartment with all his medication he has to take which makes him feel like he is just going through the emotions. The first subway scene shows how Arthur is being picked on because of his mental illness by laughing in a serious situation. This causes Arthur to make a rash decision and causes an uprising. The director Todd Philips did an amazing job picking the cast members. Each scene was important to this story as it went on. The close ups and zoom-ins, like Arthur sitting on the train after getting told he will be on the Bill Murray show, show how important and make you focus on that detail. After, Arthur goes to the Arkham Asylum, one of the many important parts in the movie. In this scene Arthur realizes about his past and what his mother, Peggy, went through. This scene is also huge because mental illness is a big issue in society today and makes people realize how big of an impact it can have on people. When Arthur leaves the Arkham Asylum you begin to piece together the hallucination he had with his neighbor. This begins to make viewers question what parts were hallucinations and what parts were really happening? The music in that scene is a great choice. The soundtrack to the film all fits together and was picked very well. This film is also interesting because unlike most movies about the Joker he is always battling Batman. But in this it takes place before Batman is Batman. It gives an insight into why the Joker became a villain and shows at one point he was a member of society, following the rules of Gotham. Another scene that was created well was when Arthur starts to transform into the Joker, by dying his hair and putting on clown makeup. Another scene is when he is dancing down the staircase. This scene is powerful because he is in his suit, clown makeup, and green hair. The music for this scene pulls it all together, it was a great choice and his dancing to the music is perfect. This is also showing his transformation from Arthur into the Joker. The scene on the subway when everyone is wearing a joker mask is powerful. This helps Arthur escape from the police, and it shows people turning on the police as well. The riot in the subway helps the cause of Arthur. The slow motion of him walking away from the subway while police run into the subway shows how confident Arthur has become and how much more confident, he is becoming. When Arthur is being pulled out of the cop car by fellow rioters and is placed on the hood of the car is symbolic. This is symbolic because there are citizens of Gotham who believe Arthur is right about the way Gotham is being run, which ties into his later encounters with Bruce Wayne. When Arthur uses his own blood to put a smile on his face and the crowd cheers, is the point when Arthur is no longer in control and the Joker has now taken over. The song ‘That's Life' is a great fit for this movie, which is played a few times throughout. It represents how even though society has not been kind to Arthur or others like Author, he still persevered through it and is taking actions into his own hands. On a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the highest score, I would rate this movie a 10. This movie can relate to issues in society today and is a realistic portrayal, unlike a lot of villain movies. It was directed incredibly well, and each scene is important to understanding the character arc the main character goes through. It also brings up mental illness which is an incredibly big issue today. Although Arthur's mental illness is very extreme, it still sheds light on how impactful it is on people. The background music in all the scenes match perfectly with the characters' attitude and show the seriousness of each situation. This really helps show how Arthur transformed into Joker and even when he wasn't telling you still understood the emotions he was feeling. It also shows how little Gotham did for the poor and mentally ill citizens. Todd Philips did a great job with bringing his idea to life and making people empathize with Arthur Fleck.",Joker,Joker - Movie Reviews

إقتباس من جملة نطقها الجوكر على لسانه في فيلم The Dark Knight والتي تمزج بين الرغبة في الشعور بالشفقة تجاهه وبين تبرير أفعاله التدميرية في مدينة جوثام، أما شخصية أرثر المهرج والتي عرفت بأسم جوكر في النصف الثاني من فيلم Joker من تأليف وإخراج Todd Phillips كانت الكاشف الأول عن العالم الحقيقي للجوكر والمبرر المنطقي لخلق شخصيته في أي مكان وزمان مماثل إلى العالم الذي أجبر أرثر على محاولة العيش فيه طويلا مع والدته داخل مدينة جوثام، وذلك من خلال مشهد وراء الآخر وبسبب هذا البناء التراتبي للشخصية يمكن تفهم حالة السوداوية التي تم تحذير المُشاهد منها. فيلم لم يخلو من الجدل أحدث الفيلم ضجة قبل خروجه إلى النور بسبب العديد من الأسئلة ومنها من سيقوم بلعب دور الجوكر بدلا من الممثل ""هيث ليدجر""؟ إلى أن تم الكشف عن ذلك ومعرفة أسم الممثل وهو ""خواكين فينيكس Joaquin Phoenix"" تسبب هذا الأمر في دفع الجمهور إلى حالة من الإنتظار والترقب لما يمكن لخواكين تقديمه في مثل هذه الشخصية المعقدة خاصة وإنه ممثل له ثقل، ولكن لم تنتهي الأسئلة والحيرة عند هذا الحد وبدأت تساؤلات آخرى وهو تخص المخرج، فمخرج العمل تود فيليبس يعرف بإخراجه الأفلام الكوميدية ومنها على سبيل الأمر The Hangover بأجزاء الفيلم الثلاث وفيلم Due Date وبالطبع هم على النقيض من صورة الجوكر الدموية وطبيعة الشخصية المحفورة داخل ذاكرة المتفرج بسبب قراءة القصص المصورة ومشاهدة أفلام باتمان والجوكر، ومع ذلك لم تتوقف حالة الجدال والتخوف عند هذا الحد فعقب الإعلان الأول عنه قامت المباحث الفدرالية بتحذير جنودها FBI من حضور الفيلم لما أتسم به الإعلان من مشاهد دموية كما زعموا في تقاريرهم ، المثير في الأمر إنه بعد عرض الفيلم في مختلف دور العرض كانت ردود الأفعال شديدة الإنحياز بين محبي وكارهي الفيلم حيث لا وجود لحالة وسطية بينهم ؛ الحالة المنتشرة من الجدل هو أمر مفرح في حقيقة الأمر لأنه أبسط ما تستحقه شخصية ثرية وصعبة البناء مثل الجوكر. جوثام رحم خصب لخلق جوكر لم يسبق للمُشاهد معرفة الحياة الخاصة والنشأة الإجتماعية التي ترعرع فيها ""الجوكر"" حتى يصبح بمثل هذه العدوانية وعدم المنطقية، فكل ما سبق معرفته كان قشور سطحية عنه وعن الآذى الذي تعرض له في مدينة جوثام فقط، أما في فيلم ""جوكر Joker"" يستطيع المتفرج أن يشاهد الحياة السوداوية التي سعى آرثر للتعامل معها منذ اللحظات الآولى من الفيلم، أظهر المخرج فيليبس مدينة جوثام بأنها شوارع تفيض بالقمامة والقاذورات وذلك عن طريق حركة الكاميرا عند جانبي الشارع فضلا عن الإذاعة التي تخص أحوال البلدة بأنها مدينة ممتلئة بالقمامة والفئران، وفي هذه الأثناء كانت الألوان المستخدمة لتظهر البلدة هي ألوان غاية في السواد خافتة في إضاءتها تشعرنا بحالة من البؤس والحزن وليس الغضب والثورة، في هذه المدينة ايضا نجد حديث تلفزيوني تعمد فيه المرشح السياسي بإهانة الشعب عن طريق وصفهم بأنهم مجرد مهرجين، الصور السابقة سعت إلى تمهيد عالم ديستوبي تعمه الفوضى وهمي ليس للخير مكانا فيه حتى لا ينصدم المُشاهد من مشهد ما. تدور أحداث الفيلم حول شخصية آرثر، آرثر شاب يعمل كمهرج محدود الدخل والموهبة ايضا وسنعرف الأسباب فيما بعد، يتعرض إلى تعدي جسدي وضرب مبرح من قبل مراهقين بدون وجه حق، لكنه لم يحاول الدفاع عن نفسه وفضلا عن ذلك لم يقف الأمر عند هذا الحد بل تعرض للمضايقات والتنمر من قبل رئيسه وزملاؤه في العمل ماعدا زميله القزم، من خلال أحداث الفيلم نكتشف إصابة آرثر بمرض يدفعه إلى الضحك الهستيري المرضي الذي لا يتوقف، يبدأ آرثر في الضحك عندما يكون أمام مواقف تثير غضبه وسخريته ولكن بسبب تعارض ضحكاته مع الموقف عليه أن يستمر في جلساته العلاجية أملا في تحسن حالته. يعيش آرثر مع والدته المريضة في شقة بسيطة ومبنى متهالك ورغم كل ما سبق يبذل آرثر كل ما في وسعه من أجل سعادة والدته والعناية بها، وخلال هذه الأثناء يعطيه زميل له مسدس حتى يكون وسيلته في الدفاع عن نفسه في عالم يزداد فيه الجنون يوما بعد يوم ومع توالي الأحداث يلجأ آرثر إلى إستخدامه ولكن دون الشعور بالذنب تجاه القتلى وتتولى الخيبات أثناء أحداث الفيلم إلى أن تصبح حياته أكثر أهمية من موته الذي كان يتمناه. الشخصيات المهمشة في حياة آرثر الأمر اللافت إلى الإنتباه أن جميع شخصيات الفيلم هم شخصيات تستحق الرثاء والشفقة مع إختلاف تلك الدرجة فالسياسي نفسه يتم قتله أمام أسرته في نهاية الفيلم، النساء الذين ظهروا في حياة آرثر مهمشات في حقيقة الأمر فنجد ""والدته"" سيدة مسنة مريضة أرغمت آرثر على أن يكون لقبه هو Happy رغبة منها في أن يكون آرثر وسيلة لإضحكاك الآخرين لا لنفسه وهو الأمر الغير مفهوم فمن الطبيعي أن تسعى الأم إلى سعادة إبنها وليس إلى سعادة الآخرين عن طريق التضحية بإبنها لكن آرثر كان متقبل لرغباتها ولهذا سعى لأن يكون مهرج ولكنه بالطبع مهرج لا يضُحِك بسبب إفتقاره لمثل هذه الموهبة، خلال أحداث الفيلم ترسل الأم خطابات بصورة مستمرة إلى الرجل الذي سبقت أن عملت لديه وتظل طوال الفيلم في حالة إنتظار من أجل الحصول على رد وعن طريق الخطأ يقرأ آرثر الخطاب الآخير ليعلم أن والده هو هذا الرجل السياسي المرشح في الإنتخابات، حاول آرثر الوصول إليه ولكن عند مواجهته قام بنكر الأمر وتعنيفه مفجرا حقيقة مرض والدة آرثر العقلي ويخبره بمرض والدته العقلي وبالفعل يجد آرثر أوراق تثبت ذلك، يضع هنا المخرج المُشاهد في حيرة حقيقية ففي عالم مماثل إلى العالم الذي يعيش فيه آرثر يسهل تزييف الحقائق لأن جوثام مجتمع ديستوبي مشوه وملوث يغلب عليه الإنهيار المجتمعي والقمع السياسي مما يعطي إحتمالية زيف هذه الأوراق ولكن طريقة الحصول عليها تؤكد احتمالية صدقها، ولهذا لا توجد حقيقة مطلقة في هذا الفيلم، بل تكاد تكون الحقيقة هنا هو أنه لا يوجد حقيقة! التلاعب المتكرر في الفيلم بتنقله الدائم بين أكثر من رواية يفقد المتفرج القدرة على تصديق اي من الروايتين ولا يكون منه إلا أن يستمتع بمشاهدة الفيلم وهو قابل إلى تصديق جميع الروايات. التلاعب الآخر الذي ظهر بوضوح في الفيلم كان عن طريق شخصية ""الجارة"" وهي Single Mother تعمل على تربية ابنتها بمفردها دون اي وجود لرجل في حياتها، صاحبة بشرة سمراء ومن المسلمات في تاريخ العنصرية هو وجود أمرأة ليست متزوجة وسمراء في بلد أوروبية مما جعل وجودها في مثل هذه الهيئة الشكلية والوضع الإجتماعي هو تأكيد على التهميش الواقع عليها داخل مدينة جوثام، يحتك آرثر بها في المصعد وتنشأ بينهم علاقة رومانسية عذبة ومن خلالها تكون داعم حقيقي له والشخص الثاني بعد والدته الذي يثق في موهبته فنشاهدها مبتسمة أثناء سماعها إلى نكاته، ولكن طبيعة هذا الفيلم دائما ما تصدم المُشاهد فهي لا تعرفه! إذ فقد كانت كل المشاهد التي أتسمت بالعذوبة عبارة خيال ورغبة داخلية لدى آرثر تمنى العيش فيها، وهذا بالتحديد أمر مهم لمن يريد البحث حول دوافع الجوكر إلى القتل لأن معايشة الخيال وكأنه الواقع هو أكبر دليل على كونه شخصية مضطربة ذهنيا. كان آرثر يمتلك دوافع إنتحارية أخبر بها ""طبيبته"" بوضوح لكنها لم تلق لحديثه اي اهتمام فقد كانت تكتب له ورقة الأدوية المصرح له بتناولها والمدعومة ماليا، عندما أراد آرثر للمرة الآولي أن يتحدث بما يدور بداخله بكل صراحة إلى الطبيبة كان ردها عليه أن المجتمع لا يهتم به وبها فقد تم إيقاف التمويل لهم وسيكون على كل منهما أن يسعى في طريقه بعيدا عن الآخر، هذا الأمر الذي حدث بالفعل في عام 1981 عندما ألغى الرئيس الأميريكي رونالد ريغان قانون أنظمة الصحة العقلية لعام 1980 الذي أصدره جيمي كارتر، ما تسبب في دفع العديد من الأشخاص الذين كانوا تحت المظلة التأمينية إلى الشوارع وكأن هذا الخط الدرامي هو إسقاط وتعرية لحقيقة ما حدث قديما مما يؤكد إمكانية خلق جوكر في مثل هذه المجتمعات بسهولة. بسبب عدم وجود إشراف طبي كان من المنطقي أن تسوء حالة آرثر إلى حد الإنتحار ولكن طريقته في التعبير عن معاناته كانت في القتل والرقص والإبتسام والضحك الحقيقي لأول مرة، فعندما لجأ آرثر إلى القتل اختفت حالته المرضية التي تخص ضحكاته المضطربة اللاإرادية، وكأنها تأكيد على يقين آرثر من مقولة الفيلسوف جان بول سارتر ""الجحيم هو الآخرون"" فعن طريق القضاء عليهم تمكن من الرقص بخفة ورشاقة وأمتلك وجهة نظر في هذه الحياة. آرثر ولد طيبا لماذا لجأ آرثر إلى القتل؟ في جريمته الآولى التي لجأ فيها إلى المسدس كان لديه غرض نبيل من المضحك قول ذلك ولكنها الحقيقة، عندما شاهد آرثر مضايقة ثلاث شبان إلى فتاة داخل محطة المترو تصاعدت ضحكاته بسبب سخطه من الموقف وهنا حاولوا هم التعدي عليه، دافع عن نفسه للمرة الأولي فقتل أحدهم، كانت المرة الآولي التي يخشاه فيه أحد فقتل الثاني والثالث حينها بدأ الشعب يشيد بأفعاله ويرتدون أقنعة المهرج مثله أثناء قيامهم بالثورة، رد فعل أهالي مدينة جوثام كان التعرية الحقيقة لهذا المجتمع فجميع أفراده ليسوا سوى جوكر في إنتظار فرصة مناسبة للتكالب والثورة وإعمام الفوضى، المهمش ينتظر فرصة واحدة حقيقية من أجل إثبات نفسه حتى يعوض حالة اللامرئي الذي فرضها المجتمع عليه وهنا ليس من المنطقي أن نطلب منه أن يظهر بصورة أخلاقية بل على العكس كلما ظهر بصورة مشوهة كلما كان أوقع لطبيعته. لم يكن من الصعب الإقدام على تنفيد الجريمة الثانية وهي القتل بالوسادة، قتل آرثر والدته بسبب إكتشافه انها السبب الرئيسي في تدمير حياته بإصابته بهذا المرض المزمن من الضحك بسبب تعذيبها المميت له في صغره، آرثر لم يعش يوما واحدا سعيد في حياته، بطل تراجيدي في وضع مأساوي منذ نعومه أظافره يجبر المُشاهد على الشعور بالشفقة تجاهه ودعم عمليات العنف والقتل التي قام بها، ولهذا كانت جريمته الثالثة مرضية نفسيا للمُشاهد وهي تهشيمه رأس زميله في العمل الذى آتى إلى منزله لزيارته فهشم آرثر رأسه أمام صديقهم القزم ومما يؤكد أن قتله لمن حوله لم يكن إعتباطي وإنما لغرض إنتقامي لم يقتل القزم بل حاول طمأنته وفتح له باب الشقة حتى يذهب في سلام، وعملية القتل الآخيرة من نصيب مقدم البرامج موراي ""روبرت دي نيرو"" الذي كان يعتبره بؤرة الضوء والسعادة الوحيدة في مدينة جوثام حتى إنه كان يمهد نفسه لمقابلته ويتخيل الأمر أكثر من مرة ولكنه فوجئ بسخريته منه والحط من شأنه، فقتله هو الحل الرادع من أجل إسكات صوت الإعلام التلفزيوني المزيف فهو وجه آخر إلى السلطة التي لا تأبه بالشعب الحقيقي. جوكر وليس الجوكر كان قرار المخرج فيليبس عندما أخرج فيلم بهذا الشكل هو إغراق المُشاهد داخل عالم آرثر وليس عالم الجوكر مما جعل الفيلم منفصل ومختلف عن صورة الجوكر المخلدة في الذاكرة وفي نفس الوقت ساهم في خلق فرضية انها قد تكون الحياة الغامضة التي نشأ فيها الجوكر حتى يصل إإلى مرحلة ما قبل الوحشية الغير مبررة، والجوكر قد لا يكون آرثر بعينه بل هو كل شخص من أبناء بلدة جوثام الذي ذاق الفساد والتعفن داخلها، في هذا الفيلم نجد آرثر قد تحول إلى ""جوكر"" وليس ""الجوكر""، جوكر هو إسم قد تم إختياره بصورة عشوائية في النصف الأخير من الفيلم عندما سخر موراي من آرثر أمام المشاهدين ولم يكن يعلم اسمه فقدمه في فقرته بأسم ""جوكر"". كان الأسلوب الذي لجأ إليه آرثر عند القتل يزداد عدوانية شيئا فشيء كما ذكرت في الفقرة السابقة فمن طلق ناري إلى خنق بالوسائد إلى تهشيم رأس ثم القتل أمام جميع مشاهدي التلفاز، فقد أعترف آرثر وهو في ثوب شخصية الجوكر بقتله للثلاث شباب في برنامج موراي على الهواء مباشرة ولم يقف الأمر عند هذا الحد بل قتل المذيع نفسه الذي سخر منه، امتلك آرثر كل المقومات التي تجعل قتله تبرير منطقي فقد كانوا هم من تسببوا في الآذى الذي تعرض له فكما يقول جان جاك روسو ""الإنسان يولد طيبا، المجتمع يفسده""، لقد أفسد شعب جوثام آرثر وجوكر في نفس الوقت في السابق سخروا منه وتعمدوا تهميشه وعندما تحول إلى قاتل قاموا بتمجيده، وفي الحالتين فهو يستحق شفقة المُشاهد. منطق الجوكر في إتخاذ قراراته ليس بالضرورة ان يكون نفس المنطق لدى المُشاهد الذي يشاهد الفيلم عند إتخاذ نفس القرارات في حياته الواقعية، ولهذا كانت هناك مواقف هجومية تجاه الفيلم بأن البناء الدرامي له ضعيف وغير منطقي، في الحقيقة أن عدم منطقيته هو أحد أسباب أهميته، فالفيلم بأكمله يدور في الثمانيات عند مدينة وهمية تم إفتراضها في عالم القصص المصورة تسمى جوثام، اي انه لا ويوجد ملمس حقيقي لها على أرض الواقع رغم إشاراتها الواضحة والصريحة إلى تشابهها مع مدينة نيويورك ولهذا يكون توظيف أغنية That's Life للمغني Frank Sinatra أمر منطقي، فكل جملة داخل الأغنية تصف الحالة الشعورية لآرثر المحاصر طوال الوقت إلى أن تحول إلى رمز لدى سكان مدينة جوثام ليحقق بذلك هدفه البسيط من هذه الحياة وهو ألا يظل غير مرئي في أعين الجميع قائلا: ""أنا الآن موجود، بدأ الناس في ملاحظتي..""",Joker,Joker - Movie Reviews

There's some problems but eh. This film is what solidified this saga for me. At first the highest i rated one of the films was a 7.6 for ""Empire Strikes Back"". Granted, I was torn about my ratings from the get go, but this film is what really awakened my true feelings. Empire went from a 7.6, to a 7.9, and then after this film, an 8.7. This film barely beating it, at an 8.8/10. I mean, I know it might change later, just like it has been, but for now I feel confident enough about my ratings and reviews; which is a first, ever since I started this saga. The Star Wars Saga went from a good franchise, to being one of my fav universes/franchises in film history. It gripped the Force around me, and now I love it and the Force is with me.

1143,Chris F,"Nov 19, 2021","It's hard to even encapsulate my thoughts in words, because I'm not even sure what I witnessed. Like watching a person in a wheelchair topple down a flight of stairs, I want to do anything to help, and yet I can only sit back and watch aghast knowing that there's only suffering left. This is immensely sad it becomes comedic, in a deeply mournful way. It feels impossible to make a mockery of something with such a powerful legacy such as Star Wars. But Rise of Skywalker somehow exceeded all hopelessly low expectations to be an absolute travesty of filmmaking. I've heard that this was an attempt to reset from the mistakes made in The Last Jedi. And yet the entire runtime of the film is filled with MORE mistakes, nothing of which resolves or absolves the previous poor filmmaking, and all which only makes the situation worse than it already was. It's as if Abrams gave up before he began, attempting to juggle far more than he knew he could, dumping his entire juggling act on the floor, shrugging, and walking away even though he was paid to entertain. The first part of this film is exhausting. The nonsense jump-cutting from scene to scene at (quite literally) lightspeed is so disorienting. It was so hard to wrap my mind about even what the general plot or objectives were as it bounced between conversation and action spectacle. Only when Lando Calrissian makes an obligatory cameo that I was somehow drawn out of my drunken stupor, and realized that I was actually watching a beloved series near and dear to my heart. And then I saw that series so bastardized that it was hard not to sit back and mock the entire thing. Jedi ghosts have super powers! Rey also has healing superpowers, wowee! Is that Palpatine? What's he doing there? Look at all those sith in coliseums. Why are they there? Who knows! It's just nonsense. To think of all the controversy there was when the new trilogy was originally debuting, and the entire Star Wars canon had to be reset just to make it make sense; knowing this is where it all ended up, it's almost a joke that the lore needed to be reconstituted at all. This series stomps on everything you love and acts happy about it. And you're meant to feel joyful that everything you love has been destroyed, truly and completely. You're meant to like this.

JJ has to come back and try to fix this trilogy, an impossible task I'd say, and I'd be correct. This movie is a mess with MAJOR plotholes, and it seems like it satisfied the fans? I don't get that, maybe the positive reaction stems from the after-shock of having to watch Rian Johnson's attempt at butchering the whole franchise, but this movie seriously lacks the Star Wars charm, which George Lucas gave us with his film. The reason why The Force Awakens is held higher than the two later instalments into this sequel trilogy is because that movie has the Star Wars charm, and the nostalgic feeling and hype around watching Star Wars again got to us all. There is serious potential wasted in this sequel trilogy, JJ played it safe, Rian ruined everything, and this is the attempted clean-up... This is a sad attempt, Disney, maybe you should try to bring in a George Lucas or a Dave Filoni in a supervising role or something. Both of them know how to handle this franchise.

1196,Jacob R,"Jul 04, 2021","This is a movie, that even now I still can't really make my mind up about. Like, I enjoyed it, I'm giving it a positive review, but it's easily the weakest of the entire franchise, and I actually don't think it's that close. The biggest problem is that this isn't a ""Toy Story"" movie; it's a movie completely about Woody. Everything is around him, not the rest of the toys. Because it's the fourth film I guess they can do that, but imagine if like a seven year old went with his or her family to watch this movie. They'll like it, but are they going to remember characters like Jessie, Bullseye, and the rest of the gang like the other three films? No, they're just not. In the other three films it felt like the screen time for all the characters were perfectly balanced. In this movie, however, again, it's all about Woody. Another big thing is that the new characters are really either a hit or a miss for me. Like I love Duke Caboom, but not really that tiny officer toy thing. It's like the same thing that Toy Story 3 has, just more of a distraction, at least for me. Now, with all of that said, this is a really enjoyable movie to watch. Animation is great, I like the story enough, but what's not talked about is the setting. Putting this story in a carnival was such a smart idea, and it can lead to a lot of good ""action"" shots. So yeah, I'm recommending it, just don't expect the same impact the other films had. There was really only one scene that left a huge impact for me, and without going into spoilers, it involved Gabby Gabby, the villain. I would put on a lot more Pixar movies before this one, but I wouldn't mind taking this one out of the toy box every now and a then. Go to Disney+ and make you're own opinion on this probably ending of arguably the best animated franchise ever!",Toy Story 4,Toy Story 4 - Movie Reviews

1202,Jerry S,"Jun 15, 2021","Toy Story 4 was pretty good. The animation was top notch and the best out of all of them. The story on the other hand needed some work. I honestly think that this movie should've had a subtitle under it because this feels more like a Woody movie than a a stand alone Toy Story film. I have no problem with it being a Woody movie but the movie is called Toy Story. With this I did expect the story to be about Woody and the toys not just mostly Woody himself. Sure the new characters like Forky, Gabby Gabby, Ducky and Bunny, and Duke Kaboom were memorable and fun to watch it just would've been more entertaining with the other toys that are there. However despite the movie's flaws there's a lot that I enjoy in this one. I enjoy Woody and Bo Peep's relationship. I actually enjoyed the father figure between Woody and Forky and I also enjoyed Bonnie experiencing school for the first time. However my favorite thing about this movie is the ending. I just loved how this movie ended. I really like the idea of Woody doing what he wants for wants he really wants to be with Bo Peep and he finally gets to do that is just so satisfying. This brings so much character development from Woody and opens the door to so many possibilities to tell knew and interesting stories for the toys. So overall was Toy Story 4 perfect? No, but it does do a lot of interesting things to not only keep you engaged but to also make you feel satisfied. 9/10",Toy Story 4,Toy Story 4 - Movie Reviews

1231,Jacob R,"Jun 27, 2021","Man….did Pixar kick off this decade with a bang with another 5 out of 5 movie! The last couple of Pixar movies have been some of my personal favorites, with Cars more suiting as a guilty pleasure than anything else. However, I think Toy Story 3 is better than all of those films by a good bit. First, the story and plot. It's a prison break movie, which I'm already a sucker for. Combine that with the Already great storytelling of Pixar, and you have a chefs kiss for it! Next, the villain. Lotso is probably the best Pixar baddie since Syndrome. He has a great backstory, and for the majority of the film, he wins, which is kind of insane. Now, let's talk about the animation: it's perfect, not too much to talk about there. And the ending, OMG the ending! It's such a great way to end the movie. If I had to nic pic one thing, it's probably the plot line of making Buzz a space ranger again, that seemed a little lazy. But that means we got Spanish Buzz, the funniest part of the film, so it doesn't affect the quality of the movie at all. The question really is is this the best Toy Story film? To me at least, I like the second more, the sole reason being that I like the characters introduced in that one better than this one. Not to say the new characters are bad in anyway, but are they going to leave as big an impact as Jessie or Bullseye? Yeah, me neither. This is a great film, and a perfect way to end this franchise….too bad they made another one, but that's for another review.

I also like the idea of a prison break out of a summer camp. And I also really like how they keep on bringing memorable new characters. And the ending of the film does put you on the edge of your seat. However even though I like the ending of this movie I think it would've been better if it had a tighter good bye to Andy. I think it should've had a little bit more time to feel the emotion through Andy, Woody, and Buzz. But other than that I really enjoyed this movie.

Hamuru 8 parçaya ayırıp parçaların her birini güzelce yuvarlayın. Tezgahı ya da başka bir düz zemini bolca unlayarak hamurları tek tek açın. Tereyağını eritip hamurların üstlerine gezdirin. Hamurları dıştan içe doğru sararak rulolar yapın. Ruloları kendi etraflarında spiral olarak sarıp 10 dakika kadar dinlendirin. Dinlenen hamurları yeniden tabak büyüklüğünde açın. Tereyağını eritip içine suyu ve tuzu ekleyin. Yeniden donmaması için kısık ateşte bekletin. Hamurların her iki tarafını da yapışmaz tavada iyice pişirdikten sonra üzerine yağlı sudan sürün.

Once again the performances are great, and the characters are as great as they were in the first. However this time around, we get introduced to an even more compelling villain than Barbossa from the first film: Davy Jones. Davy Jones is the best villain the ""Pirates"" franchise has to offer. Besides Jones, another aspect of this film that I think puts it above the first is the plot.

On the complete off chance, someone stumbles upon this review who has yet to watch the movie (that's got to be one niche market haha), it's fun, action-packed, has literally the best CG villain of all time, and actually an ok plot. Honestly don't get the hate for number two, it's still got a lot of the good qualities of POTC and hasn't yet gone threes route of being a bit ott and down right messy righting wise. Zimmer's new additions to the score are also very welcome, Klaus did a fantastic job with the first movie, but honestly I think he'd gone as far as he could with creating an incredibly iconic theme. Needed Zimmers expert touch to do the more subtle love themes and breath more life than solely reusing the same old main theme again and again.

Like the first movie, the visuals, music, costume, makeup and set designs are incredibly impressive, the acting is just as good, the film is honestly funnier than the first, it's a much darker movie, the characters are just as great and have clear motivations and once again, we get amazing pirate action scenes especially with the Kraken, the Will vs Norrington vs Jack fight and I love the ending where Sparrow comes back to ‘defeat' the Kraken. Seeing Will's father was also heartwarming and Davy Jones is a great villain and is built to be an intimidating threat but it's flawed. The tribe scene (whilst hillarious) adds nothing to the plot, Beckett does nothing throughout the movie but sit in an office and I just don't find the plot as intriguing as the first movie. It's basically a treasure hunt story without the obstacles. It seems more focused on characters than telling a fun story and because the story isn't over yet, it's also not entirely satisfying but it's still a good movie but the first movie was way better.",Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest - Movie Reviews

This movie has the best fight scene out of all the pirates' movies. It is well choreographed and worth its 2 hour run time.

To be real, there's never gonna be a Lion King rendition that's gonna come anywhere close to the 1994 classic, let's be honest with ourselves. However for it's credit, this remake did not want to make me leave the theater in disgust. If anything it's a good movie that it's worth a watch, you just gotta dial down your expectations of the movie because some parts of it are kinda watered down and a bit of filler moments are put in there too which would explain this movie being 25 minutes longer than the original. Other than that, it does follow the script to the letter and makes for a good nostalgia high with modernized graphics. Props to the CGI team, this movie does look beautiful, probably the highest mark of the movie. It's not a bad Disney movie at all, the unfortunate part is that it does not surpass what the animated classic has already brought out to us and those are shoes that are almost impossible to fill so I can understand this movie falling short in some parts. It does make for a good comparison of what is being brought to this generation versus what my generation got as a kid growing up in the 90's.",The Lion King,The Lion King - Movie Reviews

While it's a shame that director/producer Jon Favreau added nothing new to this tale (despite proving his capabilities with 2016's vivid and fresh 'The Jungle Book') it manages to retain the soul of the original and is sufficiently entertaining. Excellent voice and vocal performances couple with stunningly life-like depictions of wild Africa and it's animal inhabitants to satisfy fans hoping to relive an old favorite, while offering new viewers an experience approximate to what the rest of us experienced in 1994, albeit with less facially emotive animals.",The Lion King,The Lion King - Movie Reviews

The CGI is the best in any ""Star Wars"" films, and the entire story feels darker though still very welcome. The action is also done very well in this, and the worldbuilding is still very spectacular. About the only bad thing I can really think about this film is that there is quite a number of instances of fan service, though I think that this film handles it better than most other films do. Jones, Luna, Mendelsohn, Yen, and Tudyk are some of the better actors that really give it their all in this film. The humor is also very well and lands a majority of the time.

1350,Yuri L,"Sep 18, 2021","One of the best Star Wars films ever made, and certainly the best one made during Disney's ownership of Lucasfilm. This movie took a risk by dispensing with the orthodox Star Wars formula by not being focused on the Skywalkers, and instead introducing a new set of main characters who all died at the end. The risk paid off. A change in pace from the normal style of Star Wars films worked well. It was nice to watch a Star Wars film without countless scenes about the force and pompous Jedi preaching. Instead we had an intertaining action film which expanded the lore of the Star Wars universe in an interesting and exciting way. The final Battle of Scarif was very well executed, with an epic space battle and a satisfying and unorthodox ending. My only issue with this film is the character of Cassian who was supposed to evoke some sort of false-equivalency between the empire and the rebellion with his stories of committing unforgivable war crimes for the rebellion. This might be a good point regarding conflicts in the real world, and it might have worked in Star Wars but it was awkwardly executed and unbelievable considering the very black and white perspective we get on good and evil in other Star Wars films.",Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,Rogue One: A Star Wars Story - Movie Reviews

I thought all the lead actors played their parts well especially Felicity Jones as Jyn Erso. I think the visuals of this form are more artistically beautiful than the Lucas films - maybe that's the strength of Disney. I also found the plot more convincing. With the original trilogy the main stars always manage to miraculously survive but in such a conflict that wouldn't generally happen. Also the discussion of the morality of war and conflict in the rebel alliance added to the more realistic feel of this film.

All of the musical numbers were done to perfection, as well as the new songs included in the film. The animation looked great, even making a big blue Genie look like he belongs in our world. The only major gripe I have with this movie is the actor who played Jafar was nowhere near as harsh and menacing as the character was in the original.

They also tried WAY too hard to be empowering to women... to the extent they got rid of anything that seemed over-objectifying and gave Jasmine a new song and other quirks that come off as offensive to people in the middle east who have gender roles as a cultural norm.

The big problem with this movie is it banks on the audience connecting and caring about what happens to all of these new characters which just isn't the case. In fact the only familiar faces&people the audience cares about were Barbossa and Jack which are still great characters and all but there was none of the buildup like in Pirates 2&3. Because by the end of the movie nothing has happen except that a few new characters that we barely got an introduction to died which has no relevance to the series. That aside however there were some great scenes with Capt. Jack and Barbossa the palace scene for example and in all is certainly not as bad of a film as Pirates 5. So in all I would say a solid 7/10 film!",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides - Movie Reviews

1447,Matthew D,"Jul 10, 2020","A return to form for this piracy centered franchise. Rob Marshall breathes life into a dead series with his swashbuckling adventure picture Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides (2011). Borrowing heavily from the previous installments and Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade, Marshall takes us on a curious sea voyage seeking The Fountain of Youth and eternal life. Gore Verbinski's original Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy was much darker and more distinct, but Rob Marshall makes pretty well made films with a sleekness that's comforting. Johnny Depp is hilarious as the bumbling Captain Jack Sparrow, who improvises his way to victory with some clever wordplay and devious cunning. Geoffrey Rush's Captain Hector Barbossa is still fiercely entertaining with a raging vengeance sailing him towards Blackbeard. The gorgeous Penélope Cruz is cool as a sword fighting love interest for Sparrow as the voluptuous and vexing Angelica Teach. She's a wonderful addition to On Stranger Tides and adds a formidable foil element to bounce comedy, romance, and swashbuckling off of Sparrow. Ian McShane has a gravitas as Blackbeard, but I wish he got more screen time. If his crew were not focused on so much, he could have fought and killed more as Blackbeard to make him more intimidating and scary into the dread pirate Blackbeard. Kevin McNally is still steadfast and funny as first mate Joshamee Gibbs. Sam Claflin is nice and charming as priest Philip Swift. His romantic affair with the enchanting French mermaid, played by the hauntingly lovely Astrid Bergès-Frisbey, is a nice side plot for On Stranger Tides. Richard Griffiths has a hilarious cameo as King George II. Keith Richards kills it again as Jack's father Captain Teague Sparrow. He's mysterious and entertaining, while providing a serious presence in his scenes. Dame Judi Dench gets a funny quick cameo as High Society Lady. Marshall knows how to direct interesting action sequences like the double duel or the mermaid encounter with intricate timing. Marshall is also competent at directing sincere drama, but he leans too heavily here into the hectic near improvised humor. I wanted more romance drama between Captain Jack Sparrow and Angelica as well as more character development for Blackbeard. Marshall's direction is engaging and slick enough to keep me easily entertained by On Stranger Tides' 136 minutes. It's more compact than previous movies with David Brenner and Wyatt Smith's editing is more forward thinking and efficient than the bloated jump cut riddled At World's End. Hans Zimmer returns to cascade us with epic classical music for his Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides score. Heavy strings and intense percussion mark his sonic style with beautiful compositions throughout On Stranger Tides. Penny Rose's period costumes continue to amaze me with realistic pirate outfits down to the floppy hats and boots. Ve Neill's make-up is still excellent as I still like his use of black eye liner and dirty looks for all the pirates. It's not perfect with Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio rely too much on past in jokes instead of new bits, plus Blackbeard's crew being zombies is dumb and has essentially already been done in The Curse of the Black Pearl. Elliott and Rossio create a mysterious atmosphere with their intriguing writing with plenty of fun humor and lighthearted action. Dariusz Wolski's cinematography features heavenly fountain wide shots to intense mermaids attacking from dark waters with striking shots. Wolski is a creative cinematography with a stalwart style for Pirates of the Caribbean. In conclusion, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is a refreshing splash of cold water to the face after the wayward and bloated At World's End.",Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides,Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides - Movie Reviews

1455,Puroo R,"Jul 27, 2021","I had watched Despicable Me only so that I could finally understand what the whole deal with the minions was. But I ended up liking the movie and all the characters in that. As a result I decided to watch the sequel as well, which I ended up liking even more than the first one. So I thought why not just go all out and watch every single movie? And so I watched this one, and I really I think it was not something really great, although it did manage to do what it was meant to do: give us the laughs and have a good time. Despicable Me 3 is about Gru finding out about his estranged brother Dru who is living a very rich life but does not have the evil nature of Gru and thus is not liked as much by his family. And so grew is forced to take his brother along with him to stop the evil villain Balthazar Bratt, a child actor from the 80s who has faded away with time. Although the minions in this movie are way less than the previous two I don't mind this at all. In fact I kind of found them annoying and I wanted more of the human characters than those yellow Facebook meme sources. Balthazar is my favourite villain from this franchise. All his acts are very funny. Whenever he is on the screen you know you are in for some good time. There are often callbacks to his show which is very campy and has barred CGI according to today's times, which is just like how we see shows from the 80s today. He always dances and plays songs whenever he is out on the heist. It is fun to watch Gru and Balthazar fight in the opening scene and also the way Baltasar dances as he defeats all the guards on the ship. The animation of this movie is way better than the previous two, especially when it comes to the action scenes and car chasing. What this movie lacks in however, is the amount of campiness and cliched moments of having an amateur person come out on a secret mission along with the professional friend/family member. In fact the whole idea of the protagonist having an estranged twin brother is a cliched idea which has been used many times in Bollywood films. Although this isn't a very memorable movie, it does exactly what all the other movies from this franchise do. It is able to create a fantasy world with fun and loving characters who do goofy things and we enjoy them while it lasts. And this is the reason why I don't think this franchise should have more movies. By the time one movie comes we have already forgotten what happened in the previous one. Although I wouldn't say that this is a bad movie, I would definitely say that you would not remember anything other than the good parts once the movie ends, and this is the reason why this movie is so much fun to remember since I don't exactly remember what I didn't like about it.",Despicable Me 3,Despicable Me 3 - Movie Reviews

The movie has only two major weaknesses that are easy to get past being that there is too many plots and that it relies on juvenile humor and toilet humor more than the last two. However, these are just small flaws and are easy to look past once you see the plots mesh together in a really satisfying way. This movie had some pretty good highlights, like when Gru said his mother told him that his father died of disappointment when he was born as well.

1506,Jacob R,"Jul 02, 2021","I behold to you…..the best Pixar sequel that isn't a Toy Story film! So I liked this movie a lot….and that's pretty much it. I guess I could dive into all the things they changed. For example, because Dory is now the main character, Marlin and Nemo are sidelined. I don't see that as a problem with Nemo, because that's what happened in the first film. It's more Marlin that I'm disappointed in. He became just a meaner version of his character from the original sometimes, so I started to kind of dread when he came on screen. Next, all the new characters. Except for probably Hank, I don't think I'm going to remember them the same way I remember the side characters from the original film. Oh, and just to get it out of the way, voice acting and animation is once again spectacular. The setting feels like a new breath of fresh air too, with it being an aquarium. The story is pretty simple, but besides the two 5 out of 5 Pixar films this decade so far (Toy Story 3 and Inside Out), all of them have been pretty simple stories. I guess the one big problem that I have is that Dory's flashbacks are important and nice, but a little too convenient for the plot, and by the end, way too repetitive. Speaking of the ending, it's absolutely bonkers that a fish and a septopus can drive a truck, but I kind of love how crazy it is. Oh yeah…and this film has a big emotional moment, which the original, in my opinion, does not have. This is of course being when Dory is reunited with her parents. It's a chefs kiss of an emotional scene. So, is this film better than the original? No, I don't really think it's that close to be honest. But, is this a good film that I think everyone should watch! Hell ya! It has its problems, but they in no way ruin the film, at least for me.

I thought the story was touching of how Dory was finally able to see her actual family was pretty charming and heartwarming at times. However the only issue that I have with this movie is that it does feel long like the first one and some scenes could be cut out mostly some of the scenes between Nemo and Marlin because to me they felt like they were here just because they were here in the first movie. However with that being said though the movie is actually pretty interesting. I find it nice that for Dory we're getting more on her character than the first movie and this film does do a good job of making you care about the new characters that are in this movie.

It's a nice role-reverse on the ‘Finding' premise and the voice acting is top-notch from the characters old and new alike. The new characters, by the way, are easy to warm up to and easily fit into this world. The pacing of the movie is great end-to-end, and the intentions of each character are clear which makes the story easy to follow.

The inclusion of some characters felt unnecessary to the plot, and the humor in this film is miles away from the witty humor that the previous films had. The CGI and action is a significant improvement in this film, with much more spectacle to the fights. There were some odd lines said in the movie, and I think some of the acting is extremely flawed. However, the villains are great and the vast number of Jedi introduced is not done in a way where its hard to remember the names. Overall, while the film does have its good parts, there are quite a number of bad parts when compared to the previous films and I can see why die-hard fans of the original trilogy continue to hate on this film, though I don't personally think its as bad as most people will say.",Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace - Movie Reviews

1577,Dale R,"Nov 15, 2021","This film is an amalgamation of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll with a tiny bit of the 1951 Disney film thrown into the filter of Tim Burton's direction. While I was excited to see Burton's version of Wonderland, the movie changed so much of the characters from the source material that it was not a movie about Wonderland. So much so that they changed the name of Wonderland to Underland. This film looks terrific, from the costumes Alice wears to the CGI. I also enjoy the story arc of Alice and the new character of Bayard. The rest of the characters are reduced to delivering exposition or short gags. If you would like to see a totally unique version of Lewis Carroll's works then check this movie out, otherwise skip it.",Alice in Wonderland,Alice in Wonderland - Movie Reviews
1578,Latifa P,"Oct 26, 2021",This movie was visually entertaining but that was it for me. Just a lot of the same tired old hollywood tropes. The storyline didn't really make sense and so many lines that attempted to be heartfelt made me cringe. Although it attempted to be a feminist piece the narrative is so unbelievable in terms of gender norms of the period that this fantasy take feels like a mocking joke. I guess a period piece loosely based on Alice in Wonderland is another great excuse to employ an all-white cast and another skinny blond lead. Overall a shallow shiny package that failed to present anything genuinely meaningful or thought-provoking.,Alice in Wonderland,Alice in Wonderland - Movie Reviews
1579,Nathan D,"Jul 19, 2021","First off, I want to state how boring this movie is. It has serious pacing issues with it moving so slow. Some of the scenes were stretched out for too long and include unnecessary dialogue and weird visual elements. For instance, the Futterwacken scene at the end of the movie is not funny and wastes time. I appreciate the call back to the actual book, but it's just not amusing to watch. This wasted time could have easily been put to good use in the final battle scene which is so anti-climatic. It's such a shame that we went on such a long journey through Wonderland just for the final battle to be only around 10 minutes with 2-3 minutes of that being the Jabberwocky battle. The story is also very poorly written. It all just falls apart after Alice makes her way into the Red Queen's castle. The whole ""Um"" bit is not funny whatsoever and is stretched out way too long. I know that Alice has grown and that whole aspect does make some sense. However, the Knaves of Hearts not noticing it sooner or pointing it out sooner made no sense and felt like just a lazy way to create the heist scene. A lot of the Red Queen's story is very poorly written which is such a shame because Helena Bonham Carter does a good job in the role. Speaking of the cast, it's a mixed bag. The voice cast does a nice job, but the on-screen talent is a little off. Both Johnny Depp and Mia Wasikowska have some nice moments, but their line delivery is off most of the time. As I said before, Helena Bonham Carter does a nice job as the Red Queen. Crispin Glover and Anne Hathaway do a decent job, but their roles feel more like parodies of the characters rather than them actually embodying the roles they were placed in. The world around these characters is really bad. The visuals are so bland and dark that it doesn't even feel like Wonderland. I get why Tim Burton would have made that choice as their lives are all kind of miserable at the moment, but even the flashback scenes look dull and unimaginative. I would have loved to have seen some more color pop off the screen when Alice defeated the Jabberwocky. I think it would have made the film's final scenes in Wonderland be more at a decent level rather than just outright bad. Overall, this film is just a big mess with poor editing, a below-average story, and a cast that doesn't quite shine. Tim Burton doesn't do anything outstanding and just feels like lazy directing and storytelling. When Tim Burton said he had never felt any emotional tie-in to the book, that should've been some major red flags that this film would not be good in any shape or form.

What are common traits of Mercury Poisoning? Depression. Anxiety. Clumsiness. Hallucinations. Who was Mercury in mythology? The God of Thieves, and a messenger to Gods. What does Mercury hold in his hand? That is the Caduceus. That is Kundalini. That is the ancient brother-sister duo battling themselves; Fuxi and Nuwa. If we are all sitting at the table of the Mad Hatter, we are bound to have consumed his poison.

The plot is drastically changed from the original book, but it still have charm and uniqueness of story. Alice the protagonist of the story have grown up to a woman and forgotten Wonderland, she was expected to be someone she's not and still can't find her way. She is brought to Wonderland again by white rabbit according to the prophecy that ‘Alice' will slay Jabberwocky save but there's a question that ‘Is she the right Alice, the same one in the prophecy' and Alice also doubt that. Life of Alice is not smooth and Wonderland become a place full of danger but that's what make this movie interesting. Some characters are threaten, kidnapped, prisoned, and nearly executed but it's still in safe zone that people every age can watch together. In climax, Alice enter the war and slay Jabberwocky, fighting scene is not exciting and quite predictable for fantasy adventure movie with no fight experience woman protagonist but the war end beautifully. When back to her world, she returns as an elegant, brave and confident woman who walk in her own way. The background is mysterious but powerful and beautiful.

1598,Jonathan K,"Jan 15, 2021","Despite how serene the lead actress is and how competent the CGI is constructed, this might be one of the most unpleasant looking movies I have ever seen. Yes, it's Tim Burton so it's meant to be at least semi-repellent visually, but Tim Burton also relies almost entirely on his visual aesthetic, which makes this unpleasant aspect of the movie the central focus. What's unfortunate is that this was originally sold to many audiences as an Adaptation of the American McGee version, which already looks like a Tim Burton version, just better, with far, far better writing, so this would've been better. Instead, we're left with the kind of poor-to-abysmal quality script that seems to accompany most Tim Burton films, not only giving us wonky and sometimes incoherent storytelling, but even manages to mold the movie with almost every current-day Cinematic Fantasy Cliche, resulting in an Army vs Army battle with Alice as some kind of makeshift Valkyrie with a magic sword. There is good to be found -- Burton's usual use of slightly over-the-top performances complements this world as it's over the top in itself, Elfman turns in a surprisingly pleasant and epic score (considering all of his past scores for Burton films have just been off-key strings to make you feel icky and uncomfortable), and the art, while inherently repellent, is actually of solid quality for the most part; like, if I saw many of these on some place like DeviantArt I would think ""That's pretty interesting"" - the problem is that the movie never stops with it. It was a miscalculation to have the Evil Queen get so much screen-time as she is far and away the most visually unpleasant aspect of the movie, and the fact that the movie was made during the 3D boom means that she is commonly in ultra-closeup. And frankly, it just feels like Tim Burton isn't fitted to make a movie that is >90% CGI - he does have some talent with the tangible, physical world, and this movie makes me feel happy that he has opted to stay away from this kind of filmmaking since.",Alice in Wonderland,Alice in Wonderland - Movie Reviews

1604,Meydiana R,"Oct 31, 2020","I went into this film without high expectations. I saw so many ways it could go wrong, and many of Burton's more recent films have left me feeling somewhat indifferent. However, all my fears were for naught. I adored the film, without reservation. Indeed, this is not only one of Burton's best films, it is probably the best screen adaptation of Lewis Carroll ever (with the possible exception of Jan Svankmajer's Neco z Alenky from 1988). It isn't often that a film ends and I immediately want to see it again, but that's how Burton's Alice in Wonderland affected me. The cast is flawless, top to bottom. The film's vision comes the closest anyone has come to capturing the frenetic, nonsensical impossibility of Wonderland (and I loved the whole ""Underland"" thing). I'm hearing all sorts of bizarre negative criticisms, though none with merit. This is a bold and triumphant film, one that finally addresses, without holding back, the darkness and complexity and maturity of Carroll's writing. I will add that I saw it in 2-D, and was pleased that Burton avoided letting the 3-D thing ruin the movie, as is so often the case with that sadly popular gimmick. The film is a giddy, hallucinatory, unrelenting dance of shadow and light, hilarious and heartbreaking, brash and underscored, possessed of all the marvelously contradictory oppositions that characterize the source material. For the first time, I think, it felt as though Alice were truly an integral part of the landscape, and not just some baffled Victorian tourist passing through. And the climactic battle with the Jabberwocky...just wow. I cannot recommend this film strongly enough. (--Caitlín R. Kiernan)",Alice in Wonderland,Alice in Wonderland - Movie Reviews

I've seen it at least 5 times, but each time it remains a perfectly aimed film. The animations are spectacular and from 10 and praise: the hairs are treated in detail and the areas of the city are memorable. Even in the characters sector we only have iconic characters: Nick is my favorite, well characterized and with a poignant background. Judy is a great protagonist and with a beautiful story arc. The sheep is a nice twist villain that the first time I wouldn't have bet a cent on her, and good motivation too. The story is deeply inspired, unpredictable and manages to entertain. The jokes are genuine and very funny. Zootopia is a great film that makes perfection its philosophy: there is nothing negative to mention and I'm really trying to find something!

There's a modicum of comedy, a dose of mystery and an underdog component but no facet of the movie is fantastic.

Despite how much time is spent on action scenes they accomplish very little narratively.

I rewatched it with my wife and managed to enjoy it, but the decision to shoot in 48fps was even more jarring at home since we watched it only a couple days after finishing the LOTR trilogy. I actually loved the changes Peter made to flesh out the story into a trilogy; it did cause the runtime to bloat more than seemed necessary, but The Hobbit is actually one of the worst-written books I have ever read in my life and I've held that opinion since the first time I read it at age 12. If I hadn't read it myself I would have never believed that anyone, let alone a vaunted GOAT writer like Tolkien, had ever written a book whose entire purpose is building toward the excitement of the Dwarves' showdown with the dragon at the end, only to hastily cram in a different character in a single chapter and have him be the one to kill the dragon. My hatred of Bard the Bowman has colored my entire life since then, as I have a heightened sensitivity to perceived deus ex machina and I dislike Luke Evans as an actor because he played him. The only other gripe I have here is that Thorin was portrayed as rude, entitled and aggressive from the very beginning here, making his eventual heel turn completely unsurprising and his redemption arc ineffective at making me like the guy.

Devoted fans of the book will not enjoy the departures and inclusions, but for movie fans who did not ingest JRR Tolkien's dense and sometimes slow-moving children's story in their pre-teenage years, this film version will entertain more than adequately for its entire (long) length.",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - Movie Reviews
1687,Mohammed A,"Mar 28, 2021","A solid prequel to Lord of the Rings. It's nowhere near as good but that doesn't mean it's bad and expecting a movie as good as LOTR is basically you setting yourself up for disappointment. Every actor is amazing, especially Ian McKellen, Andy Serkis and I prefer Martin Freeman's Bilbo Baggin over Elijah Wood's Frodo Baggins. It has some well-choreographed action that makes creative use of the environment, it's visually dazzling and I know people have a problem with the overuse of CGI in these movies but this movie is innocent in that complaint and it's great seeing old locations like Rivendell and new locations as well as new creatures like goblins and it was a joy being back in middle earth, which is what I wanted. It can be funny and supenseful and a lot of amazing character moments like when Bilbo rescues Thorin and Howard Shore delivers an excellent score again. There's a lot of filler like the stuff with trolls and stone giants and it does drag in lots of places. There's no need for this to be nearly 3 hours long and it also lacks the suspense and stakes of the original series we're not 100% invested in the dwarves's journey as the consequences of failing won't be big. Plus, it has some tonal inconsistencies and a lot of moments where apparently physics doesn't exist but regardless, it's an enjoyable time and I'd definitely rewatch it.",The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - Movie Reviews

Yes, it does a great job with world building and cinematography. Even the acting and plot is well done. But the fatal flaw here is it is trying to set up something that has already happened (Star Wars prequels, anyone?) LoTR was an expansive world-ending extravaganza, whereas the Hobbit (at least the book) was supposed to be one quiet hobbit's experience with the outside world. The movie flips that all around and makes the Hobbit quite a big more expansive (and longer) than maybe it should have been.

Aunque no sea una gran película, esta película logra ser entrañable en pocos minutos, con personajes muy originales y muy bien construidos, en pocos minutos te enamoras del mundo de Harry Potter. Me parece que los efectos especiales de esta película envejecieron muy mal. Muchos quedando al día de hoy en pañales, aunque los efectos prácticos de esta película siguen estando igual de frescos e impactantes. Otra cosa que no me encantó de la película fue que en muchos momentos la trama se siente estirada, creo que la película tiene muchas escenas que no aportan mucho a la película y eso la hace tediosa en algunos momentos.

The main plot of the movie does not get introduced until well into the movie, and even then the main plot doesn't get much screen time at all. It's interesting to see the characters behave in the situations they are put in, but not as interesting as if these situations actually had some relevance to the plot. I feel like if this movie was released in modern times, it would not have had any sequels, much like many other movies that focused too much on setting up a sequel and forgot to be a good movie itself.

This a clearly a big budget film, and the quality shows through in all areas.

1714,ANDERSON G,"Aug 17, 2021","""Hary Potter"" is the beginning of everything, the beginning of a saga that would become one of the greatest anthologies of cinema that garners many merits, being a good adaptation of the book, a remarkable creation of characters, costumes and aesthetics, the last being its greatest merit. The script adapted by Steve Kloves manages to synthesize the most important elements of the book, of course, the book is more tense and complete, but steve manages to bring the spirit to the screen just like its director, Chris Columbus, who gives a really magical touch to the film, whether in its details, in its dark photography, the magical elements in the compositions of gothic and bizarre backdrops to even its perfect soundtrack, adding that to a great cast that perfectly matches its characters, the biggest merit here is the feeling that we are watching something really wizard, the displacement with reality is very well constructed. Far from being perfect but extremely competent, ""Hary Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" sums up the books well, has great characters, although not yet performative, has a beautiful direction, good effects for the time and a timeless art direction.

The CGI was a bit not smooth at times, but it was still good considering the technology at the time. The main trio was also introduced, and their dynamic was also entertaining. I especially liked Emma Watson's character the most. She was clever, talkative, and quirky. And because of her confidence she didn't get too many friends, which was sad, but she's in the trio now. Since I enjoyed the magical world a lot, I honestly didn't care much about the main story of this movie. Even though there's a twist that was unexpected, I still didn't feel much about it. This movie's primary objective was clearly to introduce Harry Potter and the world he just stepped into, so the main story wasn't focused on as much. Overall, an entertaining and fun movie.

1750,Tom R,"Oct 31, 2021","Firstly, it was a great idea to split the final book into 2 parts. They should have done that with other books as well. Secondly, even though alot of this film is ""build up"" - it's still entertaining the whole way through - gives us some of the darkest trials and tribulations our trio has faced - and includes the saddest death in the series of all time. It's an emotional roller coaster and prepares the setup for an incredible ending. This film is still a must see affair for all those watching Potter - and it's best to play very close attention, you'll have nearly zero questions at the end of the series.

1751,Karina A,"Sep 29, 2021","One of my favorite movies is Harry Potter. This is a whole series of films directed by Chris Columbus. The first film was released in 2001 in the UK. The films are based on books by Joan Rowling. The story tells the story of an orphan boy living with his uncle and aunt. On his 11th birthday, Harry suddenly learns that he owns magic and goes to Hogwarts. There he meets Hermione Ron, and the main events of the films take place with them. The scenery of the film simply fascinates with its beauty, delightful landscapes, flying on brooms, everything immerses you in this magical world.

Instead the audience are stuck watching their favourite characters brooding in a variety of forests, causing the audience member to become quite bored.

The opening scene of this movie was the best so far. The long chase through the Muggle's world was fast and riveting. The camera angles were creative with many cuts. They were a little bit disorienting, but still entertaining. What I liked the most was in this one, the trio spent most of their time together. Everywhere they went, the dark order was there and ready to ambush them. Even worse, the danger was so great that it affected the friendship. Also the romance, not as big of a part in this one, was still there. I enjoyed the focus on the trio quite a bit. In addition to the trio trying to run away from the dark order, they learned more about the history of you-know-who, as well as other important characters. There was a lot of mystery being explored, and it got me invested throughout the runtime. Overall, a dark and grim continuation of the story that is nearly coming to an end.

1774,Jordan M,"Apr 09, 2021","While still great, this was the least-best movie of the series for me. Not only was it by far the least-entertaining, the section of the book this covers was rather poorly written, and them splitting it in two left far too much time for scenes that weren't as good as the second-act scenes of the rest of the series had been. Without the structure of Hogwarts a lot of the scenes felt written for the sole purpose of tying up character arcs -- it would've been illogical to hold a big wedding when there were practically still warm corpses laying about and it didn't make sense for Voldemort not to be in Malfoy Manor or quickly summoned there when they identified Harry's friends. That scene and the finding of Gryffindor's sword felt like deus ex machina in that their way out of the mess was far too convenient and unlikely. Dumbledore obfuscating the clues Harry would use to locate Horcruxes to the point he risks them not being found at all doesn't withstand scrutiny either; obviously he needed to keep the information secure, but he would've thought of a more practical way... in the very first movie he bewitched a mirror so that only a person with good intentions would get the stone by looking at it, for example. Nearly all the character development in this half is dark & they spent a little too much time visually flirting with ruining Ron & Hermione's budding romance. Also, they could've chosen a more cinematic way to interpret the book stranding the trio in the woods multiple times and the film score was unmemorable, though not as poorly done as HP5's. They at least did a good job setting up the finale by getting all of the boring parts out of the way, and I cannot dislike any movie with this much emotional investment, no matter how poorly it pays off in this particular instance.",Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1,Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 - Movie Reviews
1775,Hayden P,"Apr 09, 2021","So...I'd still say that the first half of the Deathly Hallows book is better than this movie.

It's not exactly perfect, but it is a good build-up to Part 2, and I'd still recommend Part 2 over this one any day.

1781,Smith T,"Mar 04, 2021","Well here we are... at the end of it all. I would like to first point out that the first 45 minutes of this film are a 10/10. They are truly some of the best minutes you'll watch in this entire saga. Now with all of that out of the way, I'm going to say what's on my heart. THE REST OF THE MOVIE IS BORING! Like wtf happened to the pacing? It's like it just gave up. One minute you're riding on the back of a dragon and then the next you're listening to someone talk about someone... talk about someone. This movie had a lot of great things going for it and then waste it as soon as they get out of act 1. And don't even get me started on the whole conflict between Harry, Hermoine and Ron. It feels so useless and unearned. It's literally a conflict for the sake of conflict. It isn't growth for anyone and it's on the boarders of character assassination for Ron. Like when they aren't all acting like assholes, the movie is actually able to move forward. The plot begins to progress and everything feels right again. But damn it if that feeling doesn't take a long time to appear. But yeah, as you can probably tell, that ""conflict"" is my biggest problem with the story. Well, that and pacing, but at least that doesn't make you gag. Other than those two things, the movie actually quite good. It's what I wanted in teh Half-Blood Prince that I didn't get. I definitely think if stopped watching it after HBP (like I almost did) then you should reconsider.

1808,Dale R,"Nov 15, 2021","A boy raised by wolves takes a walk through the jungle and happens upon animals with differing opinions on his well being. To the film's credit, it is wonderful to look at. Knowing that the only real thing we are looking at is Neel Sethi, who plays Mowgli, is truly a wonder for the time. All the animal characters look photo realistic. Casting Bill Murray as Baloo was a terrific idea. Ben Kingsley is great as Bagheera, Idris Elba plays a menacing Shere Khan and I love Scarlett Johansson's take on Kaa. Now here is the problem: they tried to keep the musical aspect of the original animated feature. I love the music from the original, I believe the music made that movie great. But here it is gutted from its intended purpose and is only included for nostalgic reasons. Scarlett Johansson's version of ""Trust In Me"" is great, but they only used it during the end credits because they needed her character to be an exposition dump. That is a terrible use of Johansson's talent and the money they spent for her studio time to voice Kaa.

Disney has remade its classic Jungle Book (1967) and turned it into a visual feast for the eyes. This movies special effects are so realistic, it’s hard to believe that nothing was shot on a set and it was all computer generated. The cast is complied of Hollywood’s finest actors and actresses, all lending their voices to these beautifully rendered computer generated animals. This film in my opinion delivers more emotion than the cartoon and also I think is a better movie than the original as well. This movie would suffer completely if the animals didn’t breathe and come to life the way they do.

1840,Cris K,"Jul 17, 2020","Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend. I'll honestly go as far as to recommend this over the original 1967 version. I don't think is quite as charming as the original, and it has a very different animation style, both with great quality of detail in it. From the individual strains of fur, to the types of animals included (I've done so much research on Indian wildlife today), you can really see the details of the cg effects. Just watch the end credit sequence alone, and it'll prove it. There are 3 huge improvements to this versus others: Sher Khan's face, King Louie, and the intensity of the animal fight scenes. The movie isn't free of problems: I imagine someone will have issues with talking animals vs non-talking animals, that he'd have to learn the language (so how would he ever understand Sher Khan or Baloo?). If anything, I think the writing took a hit. Where the original had a subtle but strong fables sequencing to it (sort of modular moral stories with shifting focus on characters), this is structured much closer to how many video game stories are structured, serialized chapters with some level of power creep and shifting focus of environment and goals but all focused on Mowgli. And I don't think the writing is bad, but this Jungle kid (never actually reveals his backstory, somewhat of a relief honestly) is performing clean engineering using vines and pulleys and armor (that wouldn't work) with calculated positioning. I understand that some people just have talent for some things, but I had to question whether or not I could do the same thing. I could, but I'd have to do it different ways. And in all fairness some of the stupid /inconsistent things he gets up too, even though he's a ""take charge"" Mowgli in this version really got to me: I was literally cheering for Sher Khan at certain points. Ultimately I had a good time with it, and I think most people and possibly their pets will too (my cats were interested for a while).",The Jungle Book,The Jungle Book - Movie Reviews

The voice cast is incredible, who bring plenty of charisma and energy to their roles, with the standouts being Bill Murray as Baloo and Idris Elba as Shere Kha.

I liked Jumanji when it came out in 1995 so, you can imagine my hesitation when I heard about this film. Expectations went up upon hearing Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson was going to be the lead. I love me some Dwayne Johnson man! This movie is an absolute blast to watch. It is entertainment first and foremost and yet it does add some much-needed characterization to some of these kids. I will admit that I wasn't a huge fan of the extreme stereotyped version of the kids at the beginning but, once the movie got going I understood why they did that. Overall, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a extremely fun movie that you can watch over and over again.

1852,Stephy S,"Sep 21, 2021","A short but sweet coming of age movie. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a solid action movie that plays it safe which is both its biggest strength and weakness. Most stuff in here is solid but nothing special, that being said, the cast is one of the best ensembles of A-list actors I've ever seen. From Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson to Karen Gillian to Kevin Hart and even Jack Black, every actor is a recognizable face and delivers on a phenomenal performance. Their chemistry is nothing to scoff at either as they all seem like high school students who only recently got to know one another. The special effects are also top-notch with some of the most gorgeous landscapes, intricate designs that translate beautifully into a 3D environment and some entrancing particle effects. One thing I don't like is the pacing, it felt like they had an actual plan for it but it fails miserably. The story structure is supposed to represent an action videogame but it just doesn't work on film in the slightest. The slower-paced, more emotionally driven scenes feel rushed and the action sequences feel rushed. Another thing this movie kinda misses the mark on is the tension. They wrote themselves into a corner with the life system they wrote so to get out of it, they just start taking them away for the sole of comic relief and having dire stakes. These things could've definitely benefitted from a revision or two. On the contrary, the soundtrack is an absolute blast! From the orchestral themes to the licensed songs, they're all excellent. It would've been a crime if they made a movie called ""Welcome to the Jungle"" and not have the infamous Guns 'n Roses in it!

In my opinion, though the battles and fantastical plot lines spark much excitement through the films, the real magic is between the characters throughout the franchise. You get the best of both worlds; a great fantasy plot, with queer relationships with depth and growth. Queer viewers rarely get both of those things, so the Hobbit is extremely rare in that respect. The Hobbit makes it clear that romance is not all about kissing, and that queerness travels between worlds.

While this movie has an amazing final 30 minutes the movie is quite hard to get through for the first 1 hour. This movie has the biggest struggle with the tone, as people are cracking jokes during the war... This movie is a fun final conclusion but it is never even close to becoming a fun final chapter. This movie also deals with a terribly paced movie, having extended scenes for no reason, and having a bland dialogue.

1927,Ryan S,"Feb 22, 2021","Exactly what it says on the tin - to a fault. Don't get me wrong, I like it. However, towards the end 'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies' definitely begins to drag quite heavily - the impact of what eventually happens did not, to be honest, hit as strongly as it could've/should've. The pure action is good, but there's not much to remember about everything else. None of the characters, with the exception of Richard Armitage (Thorin) and Luke Evans (Bard) I guess, stand out amidst the wall-to-wall battle. Martin Freeman (Bilb), Ian McKellen (Gandalf) & Co. are are of little importance really, which is a shame. 'The Hobbit' series, unfortunately, gets inferior as it goes by. Loved the first film, enjoyed the second but this third installment - while passable - leaves me with a feeling of wanting something else from it.

Once again Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Bill Nighy deliver outstanding performances. Tom Hollander as Cutler Beckett also deserves props, as does Keira Knightley who was allowed to shine more in this film. The final action sequence, while long, does provide excellent action and a very satisfying ending for all the characters. The special effects were well done and hold up to age well.

I am planning on buying the whole saga on bluray, but for now I saw the first on vhs and then the third on dvd and I had a very hard time believing it was a sequel to the excellent, enjoyable flick that is The Curse of the Black Pearl.

Elizabeth: A badass, portrayed beautifully by Keira Knightley. Barbossa: An extremely welcome addition. Davy Jones: A more interesting villain. Worldbuilding: Really interesting and creative. Story: A good follow up to Dead Man's Chest and I love the scale of the movie and I don't get why people say it's convolutef or confusing. It makes perfect pense and the movie really feels epic. Emotional weight: It lands with many deaths and a heartwarming finale for Elizabeth and Will. Beckett: More of a threat. Shch an underrated villain. Creativity: Through the roof. Entertaining: Definitely. There's a lot to like in this movie but there's also stuff I disliked. Length: Too long. Did not need to be 168 minutes long. Orlando Boom: Generally stiff performance and I'm not a fan of how Willmwas written. Pacing: not very good.

Finally, the effects and use of Smaug in this movie is something that surprised me with how well it was done.

It's much better paced with barely any boring moments, better choreographed action sequences especially the barrel sequences, it was cool seeing the ring having an influence on Bilbo and he once again has many great moments, Benedict Cumberbatch was an amazing Smaug (and that CGI is remarkable) and the scenes with him and Bilbo were so suspenseful, we got to see brand new locations in this movie, Tauriel was pretty awesome and once again, it absorbs you into the story of Middle Earth with great character moments and the stakes and suspense are higher and you feel that throughout the movie, this time for the actual world as we see Sauron's forces gathering and Suaron himself. Not to mention it's visually stunning. It's not perfect though. The romance with Tauriel and Killi is so forced and just weird (an elf and a dwarf?), it was annoying that we did not get to see much Gandalf and it's really convenient that Tauriel and Legolas arrived at LakeTown at the perfect time. Most of the dwarves are still forgettable The weakest part is the cliffhanger and it's not an Empire Strikes Back or Infinity War cliffhanger where it still felt like a complete story.

While an Unexpected Journey suffered from a slow pace, that had an uneven tone, this movie thrives off of the faster pacing, and better mixing of tone. The only downgrade is the script which does go down in quality in favor of the faster pacing and more thrilling sequences. As a sequel it does its job exceptionally well, building up characters, and raising the stakes. Only if this movie had a sharper script, I think this could have been an amazing watch.

The conclusion is what affects it the most, in my opinion. It isn't anything bad, but it goes on for too long - yet the ending itself comes out of nowhere a little. It's iffily crafted, with the entertainment value not enough to cover it up. Again, nothing anywhere near terrible... just not as great as I wanted/expected. I also kinda wanted more scenes with Martin Freeman (Bilbo) across the midway point. I like the focus on Richard Armitage (Thorin) & Co. but I felt there needed to be more with the lead - and with Ian McKellen (Gandalf), for that matter. I've led with my negatives first, but I have many positives too. I enjoyed the scenes in Esgaroth with Luke Evans (Bard), all of the stuff there looks awesome. The character of Tauriel, played by Evangeline Lilly, is cool. Orlando Bloom (Legolas) remains fun to watch. Everything else, including the score, is very nicely done - as anticipated.

Most notable by far were the film score, arguably the most memorable of the three movies, followed by the introduction of Gollum and the revolutionary CGI quality that came with him. The flaws in this one have the benefit of being made much worse by their expansion in the third movie, that being the deus ex machina and Frodo's transformation into a burdensome wuss, and even those could be considered more a gripe with the source material than the actual filmmakers.

As the Fellowship is broken, the remaining former members are separated into smaller groups which actually allows for some development for characters, whether they are important like Aragorn or more of a side character like Pippin. The Two Towers (2002) actually offers a lot more greater things than The Fellowship of the Ring (2001) with diving deeper into themes about the hypnosis the Ring provides as well as some huge scale battles, however the pace is a lot slower and more dialogue heavy than its predecessor, which at points can be really long to sit through.

2043,Puroo R,"Jun 21, 2021","The Lord of the Rings is one long story divided among three movies, which is the reason why it is hard to review this movie in itself. I have already written a review for The Fellowship of the Ring, in which I talked about how awesome the visuals of the story are, the philosophy behind the ring and the pop culture icon that it became. That is why I won't talk about those things in this review. Rather I will talk about the characters of the movie and why it has such a huge impact in the pop culture in spite of being nearly 20 years old book adaptation. Percy Jackson has done a really great job. The story picks up from the part where Gandalf was attacked, except this time it happens from the other point of view. This not only helps the viewer remember an incident that was important from the previous movie, but also makes it interesting by not showing the exact same shots again. While previously we believed Gandalf to be just a weak old man, over here he turned out to be a strong wizard. This is the reason why it paid off to see him return as Gandalf the White. The thing I really like aobut Gandalf is that he is a perfect balance of powerful and emotional character. In one moment he is being spun around by Saruman where he is crying like a frail old man, and in the very next scene he is fighting a fire dragon. In the first movie he scared Bilbo for a second by threatening him with magic if he dared to wear the ring, but immediately after he joined the Hobbits in the party. This is the trait which adds character depth to him, preventing him from being a two dimensional person. This way we get to see him from multiple perspectives. The second character I'd talk about here would be Gollum. The first time I saw him I thought he's just another one of those cringy skinny characters every fantasy movie needs to have (Jar Jar from Star Wars prequels, Dobby from Harry Potter etc). But he's very different. Earlier he was just a normal person like the rest of us. However, it was the temptation of the ring that completely ruined him, not just emotionally but physically too. Now in spite of his immortality he wastes himself searching for an addiction he has never been able to get away from. This is the reason why in spite of not actually wanting to hurt Frodo, he is unable to convince himself that what he is doing is actually wrong. This message is very clear in the scene where he is talking to himself. Speaking of the scene where Gollum talks to himself, that scene is one of the many scenes which is able to show the emotions that the characters wanted to express. This is something that can be done only by a good cinematography, which is something Peter Jackson was able to handle. Even though that scene is ridiculed, the point behind the scene was to show how Gollum was feeling while planning to kill Frodo and not how he was actually looking like. There have been plenty of scenes where the characters have conversations, but I don't want to spoil the movie for you. And that scene was interrupted by Sam, who is the next character I'd speak about. Sam is Frodo's best friend and he can go to any limits to make sure Frodo is safe. He is absolutely pure of mind, which was shown in the first movie when he stopped Frodo from wearing the ring. Sam had heard that Gollum wanted to kill Frodo and even though Gollum was the only one character who could actually help them reach the Mountain of Doom, Sam was ready to take the risk even if it meant having to get lost. Frodo didn't trust him or rather should I say, didn't WANT to trust him. And in spite of being abandoned by his best friend, Sam never wasted any time to get back to saving Frodo. The movie also has many battle scenes, cool CGI, shows the Fellowship of the Ring fight alongside other kingdoms while Gandalf is not there to protect them. The action, the comic timings, the CGI, the acting, everything about this movie is absolutely great. The only mistake I made watching this was that I watched the theatrical cut of this movie. Because of this I missed a very important (and cool) scene from the story, which I was thinking would be answered in Return of the King. It has something to do with Saruman. So don't make that mistake. I'd say you should watch the long one, no matter how much more you have to watch. The Two Towers is the most underrated movie of the trilogy and I really wish it was talked about more. Only those people know about it who have watched the trilogy. That doesn't mean it's bad. That just means this trilogy should be watched more. Since The Fellowship of the Ring is the beginning of the adventures and The Return of the King is the conclusion, The Two Towers never gets any appreciation as it is sandwiched between the two. But in reality it is the movie which bridges the two. It is an essential part of the movie since this is where the maximum amount of character development takes place.",The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers - Movie Reviews

The Uruk-Hai are menacing in this movie along with Saruman, he actually feels like a real threat along with his foot soldiers and you get the sense that anyone can die in all 3 of these movies, with the stakes being set at the end of Fellowship. But the bar is raised as King Theoden and the people of Rohan retreat to Helm's Deep where they fight what is undeniably one of the greatest battles in cinematic history.

2047,Will C,"Jun 06, 2021","(Extended edition) This one is always better than I remember it being. Definitely the black sheep of the trilogy. The extended cut isn't as good as Fellowship's in my opinion as there are too many extraneous scenes in this cut that only serve to stifle the pacing. The worst offenders are the additional scenes of Merry & Pippin which were already the slowest parts of the theatrical cut. In this cut we get entire scenes that are utterly pointless and barely add anything, as well as some more comedically focussed scenes that seem awkward and out of place in the overall film. There are other scenes that help flesh out and develop characters which I feel should have been included in the theatrical version. For example, we get a much better explanation of Aragorn's lineage and history in this cut which is very important given the key role he plays in the plot of The Return of the King. Overall, I feel the theatrical cut of this film is the superior, especially for a more casual viewer. It may gloss over some aspects, but the pacing is much better.

It's a pretty difficult feat to have a good character that everyone genuinely hates, not for being a badly written character, but because of how well she is written, and Umbridge was done perfectly - I'd say Umbridge is the best example of a well-written character made for everyone to genuinely loathe.

This time, the school got ransacked by the Ministry of Magic, and the students weren't allowed to practice magic. I knew that after the fourth one, this movie series would get more interesting and investing. And I was right. Now, Harry Potter got into deeper danger as his mentality started to decay as the movie went on. The school ransacking plot was pretty alright. It did make me want to see Harry Potter and his squad succeed and bring down the faculties. Most importantly, I appreciated that Harry was able to bond more with the other students, not just with the trio. They used a lot more magic, which was always fun to see. The best part of the movie was near the end, it was the first time that we saw a full-out battle between the wizards. The atmosphere was intense, and I enjoyed the lot of it. Overall, another thoroughly fun display of wizardry.

2073,Jordan M,"Apr 07, 2021","I found it very difficult to separate this viewing experience from reading the source material -- they had so much plot to condense that it ends up being nearly all that we're left with. There's a distinct lack of joy de vivre as it's a rather solemn, darkly-toned book and they minimized parts in the movie that were bright points in the novel, like excising Quidditch and spending very little time at Grimmauld place. The composer basically just being some guy the director knew was a shockingly poor decision as he was clearly unprepared for so important a movie, producing the worst film score in the entire franchise. The acting from Imelda and Bonham Carter was very impressive but particularly with the former it wasn't so magnificent that it had me enjoying scenes with her character in them; my nostalgia for this series is rooted in the very first movie where there's a thick air of whimsy and wonder, and thus I generally dislike most of the deviations from that atmosphere, with Umbridge being the prime example. The third act of this is still a sight to behold and the whole thing is thoroughly enjoyable to watch, but for me this rates among the bottom of the franchise in terms of entertainment value.",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - Movie Reviews

By far this fifth instalment is the weakest out of the bunch and I know that a lot of content from the original was cut out. Some of my biggest issues with the film are the first and second parts that drag, the characters actually getting annoying and the overall theme of the film not making sense. However, the last third of the film gets much better as the character dynamics have more development and the climatic wizard duel was really well done which saves this film a lot.

2083,Brady K,"Jan 05, 2021","This movie has one main issue but for me it's doesn't take away from the movie that much. This movie feels rushed, it has moments where it's jumping from one story lane to the next and it's poorly set up. As I've said many times I wish rotten tomatoes was out of 10 instead of 5 because for me it's a 8.5/10 but since it's out of 5 I have to give it a 4.5/5 because I don't feel it's as low as a 4/5. This movie has a lot going for it a very well written protagonist, Harry takes a leadership role and thrives, but my favourite is the big wizard fight it's was ver very entertaining. One of my big issues with the Goblet of fire is how they tried to dive further into the personal lives of the characters and it didn't work this time they found the sweet spot.

Non terribile in quanto sono del parere che nessun film di Harry Potter sia totalmente orripilante, ma questo è stato onestamente il film della saga che ho apprezzato meno (sia come trasposizione del libro che come film a sè stante).",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - Movie Reviews
2087,Luke J,"Dec 29, 2020","Order of the Phoenix makes a big jump forward in terms of increasing the stakes and taking the story into darker, more serious territory. Whereas Goblet of Fire primarily focused on the school experience of Hogwarts- this one makes it clear that the focus is more on the beginnings of the wizarding war. This movie is great because the consequences are real and lasting- unlike most of the previous Potter stories where all of our main characters emerge unscathed. The adult characters play a much larger role- Gary Oldman as Sirius Black is a standout performance, and the younger cast are now closer to being adults than children. The themes are also maturing, touching on politics with the failures and corruption in the ministry. Poor leadership, abuse of authority, and the necessity of a questioning, rebellious spirit is a strong thread throughout the entire movie. The last 30 minutes of this movie have some of the high points in the entire HP franchise. The fights between the Order & Death eaters are exciting and tense. The battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore is the best one on one fight in the entire series.",Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix - Movie Reviews

As Marlin goes on his journey and develops his character, the characters he meets are all memorable and iconic. The aquarium crew are all memorable as well.

I have come up with the concept of normie long before it was created. Other than that it was also because I came from a very conservative family. I was not allowed to watch movies in theatre, especially not a Hollywood one. So as all the kids used to talk about it I grew into hating it. And when this movie came on TV I only watched it with a critical point of view. It was only years after when I watched it and truly appreciated it. Finding Nemo is a very colourful movie filled with many sea creatures. It is an excellent movie that can teach children about the different types of marine life. I have heard about how everyone started hunting for clownfish after this movie came up. Although this is a bit sad and very cruel thing to do it also shows the impact that this movie was able to create and how much people enjoyed watching it. The fishes were shown in a very cute manner, especially the pufferfish. The only problem I have with this movie is the lack of a story. It's just a fish going from point A to point B. Although this does make for a good story since it helps in character development and world building, but these things should not be done while completely sacrificing a good story. I think I really like this movie and I will watch that once again to truly appreciate it.",Finding Nemo,Finding Nemo - Movie Reviews

But I feel like this movie has something stronger than those two movies combine: comedy. This might be the funniest movie that Pixar has ever made, it's definitely the one I quote the most by a good bit. Dory alone is good for at least 7 quality jokes.

Rupper and Daniel's performance looks very strange, I don't remember if it was like that in the book but it doesn't look good in my opinion. Finally, it is a very interesting story since we know a lot about the background of the story and if it is not the first time you see the saga, there are things that make a lot of sense.

The story takes away a large percentage of what made the novel so interesting, in order to shoehorn in a bloat to the romance plot-line between Harry and Ginny. However, even with this change, said romance is abysmal, and considering it's the main focus of the movie, there's bound to be issues. With color pallets seem to swap with every scene, a cast of characters with some of the most annoying performances in the series, this movie falls flat on its face. This is incredibly ironic considering that the director previously did Order of the Phoenix, and then went on to film both Deathly Hallows parts, and both Fantastic Beasts movies, all of which were great.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - Movie Reviews

2133,Sarvesh A,"Oct 04, 2021","This is my least favorite of the movies. Both because it is unfaithful to the book and just because its a bad movie. Now I'll admit, if I hadn't read the books first, I might not have hated it as much. But even by itself: its not a good movie. I first want to disclaim: I understand the filmmakers have to cut out stuff to make the movie. My favorite book of the series is Order of the Phoenix and thats a damn good movie as well, event though they did cut out a ton of stuff. Why? They knew what to cut and what to focus on. That isn't the case here. Firstly, Voldemort's backstory is one of the best parts of the entire series. The detail, the buildup and the rhyming between the young boy in the orphanage, the charming student, and the terrifying Dark Lord is brilliant. So what do they do? Cut out all of the memories of his past except the orphanage one. I can understand cutting some of the stuff but at least give us the Gaunt memories. That is crucial to the story of Voldemort and his Horcruxes. But nope. All that great stuff is cut out in exchange for completely unnecessary and downright cringeworthy stuff (I'll get to this later. Secondly, the freaking Half-Blood Prince? Y'know the title of this damn movie? He's basically an afterthought. How many times is the Half-Blood Prince ever brought up in the movie? Barely, and even when he is, he barely factors into the story and Harry doesnt develop any sort of connection with him. The reveal that its Snape is completely tacked on in the movie unlike the book where it was a gut punch. In the book, Harry starts to relate to the Prince, even seeing him as a friend, and defending him against Hermione's suspicions. He helped Harry through the entire thing and is what gave Harry the knowledge to save Ron's life. And then it turns out that the Prince was actually the man who he hated, that sold out his parents and got them murdered (another important thing cut from the movie), in Harry's eyes, got Sirius killed, and now murdered the greatest man he ever knew. But in the movie, its just like, oh wait, is that supposed to be important? Lets add that in here even though the Prince isn't important for 90% of the movie. I swear, it feels lie this movie was just in its own land and then at the end they realized ""oh wait we want to make a ton of money off the next movie so we have to set that up."" Thirdly, Harry and Dumbledore's relationship. Both actors gave a fantastic performance. Hell in this movie, all of them did. Its the writing thats on the wall here. Dumbledore feels more like a plot device than a character. In the book, we see Harry and Dumbledore's relationship strengthening following the conversation at the end of the 5th book where all the feelings were let out. Dumbledore basically replaces Sirius as his guardians and we really get to see how close they are especially with Harry telling the Minister of Magic he was ""Dumbledore's man through and through."" But we dont get to any of that here. Nope, instead we get a cringy romance drama. Now, you might be noticing a core problem with these issues: cut out in exchange for nonsense. The stuff above is what should've been in the movie and half the stuff in the movie should've been cut out. Instead of delving into Voldemort's backstory, and advancing the character of Snape, they decided to make this movie a romance drama. Its all over the place. They also added in completely out of nowhere scenes like the Burrow burning which should've been serious but had no consequences... because it wasn't in the book at all and they realized they had to set up the seventh chapter. Thats a good chunk of screen time. Cut out all the unnecessary teenager drama, for God's sake. Was there drama in the book? Absolutely. But it was the subplot not the main plot. And it was handled a lot more seriously and/or better than it was in the movie. The drama serves the story, not the other way around, which is what the movie did. And thats the main problem with this movie. It focuses on the wrong stuff. All the melodrama, that sound be the stuff brought up here and there rather than being the main plot, the Half-Blood Prince and Voldemort's origins should be the main story. The screenwriters had this completely backwards. Yes, they would have to cut some of the good drama from the book... but thats okay. Like I said, I get that they have to cut stuff. They just cut the wrong stuff. But even then, if they handled the stuff they wanted to focus on well, I could call it a day and say its disappointing but overall a good movie. But they didnt. They even failed on all the drama they wanted to get across. If you want to make feelings and conflicts of interest the main story, at least do it well. But they even failed at that. Thee biggest example of this is Ginny and Ron. Now its pretty clear David Yates was someone who shipped Harry and Hermione from both the 6th and 7th movies. That doesnt mean you ruin other characters to get that done. I do think overall they did Ron worse than Ginny, but thats more in the 7th one. In this movie, it was Ginny that was ruined. In the books, Ginny was a sassy, confident, powerful girl who could stand up for herself and had a lot of nerve. Harry's feelings for her are built up throughout most of the book. Starting with a brief mention on the Hogwarts Express when he's unhappy that Ginny is sitting with Dean alone on the train and kicking off the plot with the scene after Quidditch practice. The drama between all the characters is very well handled in the book. In one scene, Rowling sets up grudges and building anxiety that really develop the main characters for the rest of the book. I'm of course talking about the scene where Ron and Harry run into Ginny and Dean kissing, which is where Ron's inner self-hate and jealousy as well as his insecurities are triggered by his younger sister and he finds out about Krum & Hermione, which sets up his story for the book, as well as the first time Harry realizes he likes Ginny. Unlike in the movie, they do care about Ron in the book, and Harry's inner conflict is between his feelings for Ginny and how his best friend would react if he was in Dean's place that day. Harry's feelings keep building, and later in the book, they start dropping hints that Ginny likes him as well. Ron also has a great journey where his core problem is observed: lack of self-confidence. Finding out about Hermione and Krum only made him hate himself worse, and when the Quidditch match came around and he won, he finally for the first time in his life could be proud of himself. Especially when he found out that he did it all himself, there was no Felix Felicis in his drink. He became confident, and that caused him to start becoming a jerk. Take somebody who has lacked power all their life, hated themselves for their weakness, and felt every time they were bullied, it was deserved because of weakness. And if you give them power, you'll create a greater monster than you ever could've imagined. Power in this case is self-confidence. His entire life, Ron's been overshadowed by his brothers, teased for his poorness, living in the shadow of his best friend, and now for the first time in his life, he's the one with all the attention, everyone loves him, he gets a self-confidence boost and THATS what causes him to be so horrible to Hermione. It takes a near death experience to break him out of this arrogant streak and ultimately, he becomes better as a person because of the experience. Both of these journeys come to a climax in this passage: ""We won!!"" yelled Ron, bounding into sight and brandishing the Silver Cup at Harry. ""We won! Four Hundred and Fifty to a Hundred and Forty! We won!"" Harry looked around; there was Ginny running towards him; she had a hard blazing look on her face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her. After several long moments — or it might have been half an hour — or possibly several sunlit days — they broke apart. The room had gone very quiet. Then several people wolf whistled and there was an outbreak of nervous giggling. Harry looked over the top of Ginny's head to see Dean Thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand and Romilda Vane looking as though she might throw something. Hermione was beaming, but Harry's eyes sought Ron. At last he found him, still clutching the cup and wearing an expression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head. For a fraction of a second they looked at each other, then Ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that Harry understood to mean, ""well — if you must."" This is the culmination of both their journeys. Harry finally acts on his feelings and Ron, who would've been angry if this happened at the beginning, after everything he's gone through, gives Harry his approval. THATS how you do drama well. And here's where I talk about why its just a bad movie. Instead of following the wonderful example set by the book, the writers of the movie decided to rush the relationships, remove any inch of explanation of Ron's inner journey and just have him be a terrible person in general that the perfect Hermione forgives immediately, and completely butchers Ginny's character. Ginny is for some reason in the movie still a shy little girl with a crush on Harry not having ever developed since the second book. The relationship between Harry and Ginny is rushed, and has some of the most cringeworthy scenes in any movie. The shoelace scene for one or pretty much any interaction they have. Its unwatchable. They rush the journey to get there, and do nothing afterwards. Seriously, there's nothing between them getting together and the end of the movie. All the added stuff with McLaggen & Hermione was pointless and stupid. I was actually okay with the Lavender stuff because Ron & Lavender were supposed to be portrayed as toxic. But I think they over exaggerated some of the scenes. In addition, if you need any more evidence, the moviemakers hate Ron, they gave his two best moments to Hermione. When he gives Harry his approval, and when he tells him they're coming with him wherever he's going to find the Horcruxes. Other things I didnt like: Dumbledore's funeral was not as impactful as it should've been. They did do something creative but they failed to describe how much Dumbledore meant to Harry and what it meant for Harry and the Wizarding World now that he was gone. They also cut out the fantastic scene where Harry is forced to push Ginny away from getting close to him, but at that point, they buried ship that so far there wouldnt have been any point. But two things they should've definitely kept: One, The Battle of the Hogwarts. The first one to be specific. In the book, when Harry ran down the Astronomy tower, cursing Death Eaters after Dumbledores death, he ran into a massive battle between the Death Eaters and the combined forces of Dumbledores Army and the Order of the Phoenix. Every character has a role, and afterwards, all the threads of the magnificent conspiracy by Malfoy and the Death Eaters are revealed, brilliantly tying up every plot point in the book. The Battle would've been so cool to see. Instead... we get nothing except Bellatrix laughing maniacally (I do have to say though, Bellatrix's actress is freaking fantastic, she has so much fun in the role and plays the woman that enjoys being evil so well that I understand them adding her into scenes she wasn't originally in and have no complaints there). Additionally, I hated how Harry kind of liked the fame he got in this movie. That is quintessentially against Harry's character. He HATES being famous, he hates being swarmed by people wanting to get near him all the time. Thats why its so meaningful when he uses that on Slughorn. Thats the only time he ever uses fame to his advantage, and he did it so that his mothers sacrifice wasnt in vain. But in the movie, he kinda likes being famous. The biggest example of this is when Hermione is trying to protect him from people trying to slip him love potions and tells him ""they only care about you know because you're the Chosen One."" And Harry says ""But I am the Chosen One."" That too, very pompously. That isn't Harry, its James. Harry would never say that. The real Harry would've been annoyed that Hermione didnt do more to stop the potions from being snuck and Hermione would never have needed to tell him that Harry wouldve either said or thought that himself. Oh wait, hold on. That is what happened in the book. They also completely cut Tonks from the movie, which was kinda annoying. Finally, Sirius's death had practically no repercussions. In the book, Harry is heavily hit by Sirius's death and spends all summer alone and refusing to eat, barely talking to anyone. So much of the first act includes the impact of losing his godfather on Harry. But in the movie, its almost as if Sirius's death never happened. He was there and now he's not. This movie is a dumpster fire. I didnt like the Goblet of Fire movie but at least they did the Graveyard Scene, the most important part of the movie right. It was so well adapted and shot faithfully to the epicness of the original scene that it nearly made me forgive them for completely dropping the ball on the Barty Crouch twist and a lot of other parts of the movie. At least the Goblet of Fire got the characters right, and while I dont think they did a good job with the mystery at all and ruined one of the best twists in the series, they knew what to cut for the most part and didnt sideline the main plot of the book. This movie fails to meet the very low standard of that movie. It hits very few good beats, fails with 3/4 of the main plots of the book, treats the darkest chapter of the series like a complete romantic comedy, and inserts stupid scenes that were never in the book which were either out of character, cringeworthy, or unnecessary with no repercussions. However, there are a few redeeming factors. Firstly, the acting. But sadly, not even great acting can save a bad script. Secondly, the plot with Malfoy was very well done and easily the best part of the movie. Thirdly, the effects are fantastic. And finally, they at least did the cave scene well.",Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - Movie Reviews

I don't have as much nostalgia for it as I do some of the others but it's inarguably the most complete movie of the lot, with absolutely perfect pacing (allusions toward the cabinet-related finale sprinkled in from near the very beginning), highly likeable new characters, a series-best level of comedy and a heavy focus on the three best side characters of the series with Snape & Dumbledore's parts expanded and Draco suddenly made at least 4x cooler than he was in the previous movies. Rickman, he of the dulcet intonations, is at his absolute peak with this one. They brought back Quidditch when it'd been sorely lacking from the previous two movies and they kept a healthy running time that allowed important scenes to breathe and be taken in by the audience. Most surprising of all was that the same man who'd put forth the worst film score of the franchise with HP5 returned and gave us a score that I felt was arguably on par or even superior to Williams's score for HP1; it was heavily bolstered by his use of Williams's themes, of course, but Hooper's felt more distinctive and it seemed to better match the atmosphere of each scene. My sole knock is that I wasn't quite as impressed by the cinematography as AMPAS was; I'm not a big fan of tinting an entire scene one color or the other and they do a ton of that here.

I had read the books and thought my disappointment with the movies was because there'd just be no way for a movie to live up to the books. Now I'm in the process of reading the books to my own children. They also want to see the movies, and so I'm treating myself to another round of the Harry Potter series to get a better handle on they will be able to handle the visual re-imagining of the story. I realise I can now better summarise why I think the movies fail. Although in this instance I'm talking about the Half-Blood Prince, the main problem seems to more or less affect all the movies. The heart of the matter is poor adaptation and screenwriting. Instead of wholesome stories, the movies feel like quick visual summaries of events that take place in the books on fast-forward. The Half-Blood Prince rockets along from one location and key event to the next without providing the due context for what is taking place. It's as if the writers of the movie knew that people would fill in what was missing from their memory of the book ...but that's not how a movie is supposed to work! A movie is supposed be able to stand on its own. It really is an art form to be able to condense a large story into one and a half-hours or maybe two. At two hours and thirty minutes, this monster still somehow feels poorly paced and rushed. The movie is like a malnourished overweight person. Plenty of mass, but little substance.

Ya la película al inicio tiene un excelente montaje musical con Accidentally In Love y ya para el final tiene la inolvidable escena con I Need a Hero; aunque también en general la película tiene un soundtrack increíble. El humor es muy inteligente y gracias a eso la película puede resultar muy entretenida también para los adultos y para todo el público en general. Los personajes son los mejores, desde el primer momento te encariñas con ellos y los personajes nuevos hacen que la película sea mucho mejor, son muy memorables todos; entre ellos el mejor villano de la saga que es el hada madrina. Por otro lado, el doblaje sigue siendo demasiado bueno sobretodo en español latino, creo que uno de los mejores doblajes que se hicieron. La animación sigue siendo excelente y obviamente supera a su antecesora. En conclusión, una muy buena secuela y mejor que su antecesora, me sorprende realmente que no haya ganado el Oscar como lo hizo la primera ya que para mi es la mejor de la franquicia, pero eso no le saca el puesto de una de las mejores películas de animación de la historia.

2184,Puroo R,"Jul 11, 2021","As a kid I hated Shrek. But after seeing it for the first time a few years ago, I decided that I really liked Shrek. I had to go on a vacation soon after finishing the first movie, so right after coming back I proceeded to watch the next one. And I think it's probably because of the trip or something, but I actually liked Shrek 2 more. There are many reasons why I feel this one is clearly superior to the first one, and why this is my favourite sequel among any movie (other than Lord of the Rings and The Dark Knight trilogies of course). The movie begins with the part where Shrek 1 ended. Shrek and Fiona are happily married and live their ogre lives in peace. The reason why this movie works so well is because unlike regular sequels, this one actually expanded on what could happen in future. If this was a conventional sequel it would have shown that Lord Farquaad has come back somehow and now he has joined forces with some other villain to beat them. Also some random characters would have been introduced while others would have been killed. The movie simply begins with the feeling of an adventure. Shrek, Donkey and Fiona going to Far, Far Away to meet Fiona's parents who have never seen her in the last 20 years, that's a perfect story. Remember how we thought about Shrek and Fiona before the first movie? We changed our minds for the better after we watched the movie and learnt a lesson. Fiona's parents, however, have still not seen that happen. And this is something Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming take the advantage of. The reason why this movie worked but the next two didn't was because this movie never dragged any concept. Shrek and the fairy tale characters became friends, Shrek and Donkey saved Fiona, they fell in love and married. Period. This was never 'revised' upon. Rather either the consequences of those actions or the other aspects of life were shown. Every scene looked interesting for some reason. It's almost like the creators poured all their love in every scene. No scene feels like they were just trying to get over it. Every moment is cherished: Fiona crying, Shrek meeting Puss, Shrek's friends watching TV - everything is memorable. Shrek 2 is how a sequel should be. It should give us exactly what we wish to know. It does not force any character, it does not force any scene. Everything that is introduced in this movie, every joke that takes place happens within the audience's interest. I really wish if a new Shrek movie is made, they make it like this. Shrek is meant to be something that is remembered for all time, not a meme. It's one of the most iconic 3D animated movies I've ever seen.",Shrek 2,Shrek 2 - Movie Reviews

2212,Billy R,"Nov 07, 2021","The story of Freddie Mercury is a tragic and hard-edged story about a immigrant gay man who did drugs and died of AIDS. The way this movie tells this story comes off as hollow and sanitised, there is so much inaccurate stuff in this movie like the fact that Queen broke up as a band because they were upset that Freddie Mercury got a deal for a solo album which upsets the band in the movie which never happened in real life because Roger Taylor released a solo album in the late 70s early 80s and in the movie Freddie Mercury tells the band he has AIDS a week before Live Aid in 1985 although he wasn't diagnosed until 1987.

Are we supposed to feel sympathy with the band who need to comply with his antics? Or take inspiration for how energised and on-board they are with his creative direction? The film flirts with the underlying tragedy of his private life and the illness that inevitably claims his life, but keeps it at arm's length to prevent the audience from getting sad when there's rock music to enjoy. So it's a good film but not an excellent one. Rami Malek is astonishing though, without question.",Bohemian Rhapsody,Bohemian Rhapsody - Movie Reviews

2231,Parker E,"Jul 02, 2021","It isn't terrible, I guess. I like Queen's music. Why does this movie have auto tune and lip syncing over the original recordings and not new recordings by Rami Malek unlike Taron Edgerton in Rocketman. I think it is really funny that the members of Queen get mad because they have to lip sync on tv but then they lip synced all the singing in this movie. The editing in this movie is terrible. How did this movie win an Oscar for best editing? I do not understand. They always say that Freddie is drunk or high but they never show him getting drunk or high, unlike Rocketman. The best way to describe it is that this movie is very sanitized and safe. The movie doesn't go into the real side of Freddie at all. The movie is also not factually accurate. Freddie got diagnosed with AIDS in 1987 but in the movie he gets diagnosed before the Live Aid concert which was in 1985. Rami Malek's performance is pretty good though. I liked the lawyer/manager character. The music is great but that has nothing to do with this movie. I do really like the Live Aid scenes though. The Live Aid scenes are definitely the best part of the movie hands down. I just find the Live Aid concert really cool and fascinating. I also believe Live Aid was probably the best concert ever. The story, being a true story is pretty interesting so I liked the story told in the movie. In conclusion, John Reid is a terrible person, lip syncing is bad, this movie is disappointing and mediocre but not the worst movie ever by any means and Rocketman is way better. I will say Rocketman is so much better, it's not even a competition. Bohemian Rhapsody wishes it was even near as good as Rocketman.",Bohemian Rhapsody,Bohemian Rhapsody - Movie Reviews

Maybe some scenes are created to move the story along. This is not a biopic. Most of the movie is simply invented by the writers and director. For example, Freddie didn't meet the other band members behind a van after their show; they were already roommates. There was no backlash against the Bohemian Rhapsody song; everyone loved it at the start. The band wasn't inspired to perform at Live Aid by Freddie's courage in the face of AIDS; he wasn't diagnosed with that until two years after that show. The movie at all times is heading towards that Live Aid performance, which was recreated shot for shot with the original footage.

2273,ANDERSON G,"Aug 22, 2021","Peter jackson is one of the best directors in terms of good budget use, the director probably learned that in his early career directing great trahs movies, and in ""The Lord of the Rings"" it's no different, peter makes a film of almost 4 hours grand, with impeccable costumes and makeup, great visual effects for the time and a wide range of magnificent backdrops and screen compositions, by comparison, the same year also came out Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone which cost 38 million more, although ""The Lord of the Rings"" seems much more expensive. I didn't read the classic JRR Tolkien book to know how it was transposed to the screen, but even with a long film time, we have zero waste, we have a story that constantly grows, full of arcs and a past that transports mythology, all of this combined with a classic and very well constructed hero arc that unfolds in a great intro drama, the film has four acts and a short last act that already leaves a plot for the sequel. The entire art direction of the film is exquisite, the feature film, which is already over 20 years old, leaves some special effects dated, it's true, but at the time it was very surprising and still convinces today, especially in its costumes and makeup, which are still great today. , photography and the use of the green background still work reasonably well, and the soundtrack is a show on its own, showing the inner emotion of each nucleus through its melodies. Peter Jackson works well not only the visual and script factor, but also works the small layers, such as obsession, fear and overcoming, and also knew how to squeeze the most out of his cast of actors, taking magnificent performances, such as de Ian McKellen for example. The film is very well worked in its most diverse layers, every shot is very well executed and formidable, the weakest point perhaps is the lack of coherence, violence and the sobriety tone of the work, which changes its state of mind constantly, but these are details that do not bother this work at all, which amuses, entertains and enchants to this day.

Hasn't that already happened I hear you ask. Well, yes, and here's the proof; Peter Jackson's first instalment of his staggering trilogy, and arguably the best of the three (although my opinion on that changes daily).

2285,Cameron K,"Aug 12, 2021","Well... I'm afraid that this movie is by far the most disappointing film that I've ever sat down to watch. I came in with the greatest of expectations, as I've seen countless amazing reviews, articles, and even been directly told of the praise that this movie ""deserves"". How it's ""better than the book"", ""truly riveting"", ""the greatest action movie to date"", and so on. However, I simply cannot agree with any of those claims. I think Peter cheapened much of the story, even beyond that of what's expected from compressing 423 pages down to 178 minutes worth of film *I watched the theatrical version*. Since this review is already getting very long I'm going to list out the changes that Peter made that I think were for the worse. -Merry was re-written to become a Pippin part 2, which is especially terrible since in the original story they were quite different. Merry starts out responsible and leader-like then has to deal with feelings of loneliness and usefulness. While Pippin starts out naive and mistake-ridden then learns to become responsible and valiant. -Elrond and Galadriel are very dislikeable. I could smell their superiority complex through my screen. -Gandalfs already 'not perfectly' written pre-fellowship journey becomes even worse. Like why go to Saruman before safely escorting the Hobbit to Rivendell? Why not go help the Hobbit directly after getting to Rivendell? What happened to the letter? -Aragorn and Gandalfs relationship is too mysterious. You don't see them interact with each other much, Gandalfs speaks of no importance with Aragon, and all that makes Aragorn's presence at the prancing pony even more convenient. Furthermore, why weren't the Hobbits more suspicious of him when they met? -Nazgul nerfed? Why was Aragorn able to solo 5 of the Nazgul with nothing but a sword and torch? In the book, they quickly fled because they thought that Frodo had no chance at surviving the wound, but in the movie, they stayed to fight with Aragorn for a bit before getting chased out because Aragorn was destroying them. -The Gandalf v Saruman fight was maybe the worst fight scene I've ever seen from such a big movie. Force pushing each other around with sticks, how exciting. -Elves were just cringy, with the blurring filter and ugly language, it was just too much. -Legolas, Gimli, and Boromir were less explained. In the books Legolas comes to tell about Golums escape, Gimli comes to discuss Saurons offer to the Dwarves on the lonely mountain, and Boromir comes to find counsel on his and Faramir's dreams. But in the movie, they are just there because they are important figures in their kingdoms. Although I have plenty of gripes with the movie I think it still did a fine job. I thought the production quality was outstanding, even for 2021's standards. I also like that Arwen became more prevalent in the story, although her being the one sent to help Aragorn and the Hobbits makes no sense but exploring her and Aragorn's relationship early on was a definite plus to the story. So overall I don't think it's bad but it stacks nowhere near the original story and I can't believe that anyone can say otherwise, but I seem to be in the minority so maybe I'm just wrong.",The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring - Movie Reviews

2292,Jonathan K,"Oct 07, 2021","There are a lot of neat concepts on display in this movie, and as such, it's a real shame that more aren't done with them. This movie is 157 minutes long, and only the last 10 minutes actually amounted to anything. The rest of it is a self-contained story that has very little in the ways of actual plot, and the big reveal at the end ultimately negates half of what came before, as it turns out that a good chunk of it was a ruse (but not in the ultra-satisfying way as something like Hot Fuzz or the first Saw). Throw in the fact that the movie is also darker and murkier than the other entries, before and since, and the very mediocre performance by Robert Pattinson (already one of the most over-valued people in the industry). The mystery element involving David Tennant's character, Harry Crouch Junior, is really the only thing of real interest beyond the end, but it never actually amounts to anything either, as the audience already knows that he's evil, and once he's found out, his story ends literally seconds later.. All in all, the movie isn't 'bad' by any means - it's just almost entirely meaningless in the grand scheme of things, and honestly, it's just self-indulgence that this movie was a solid hour longer than it needed to be.",Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Movie Reviews

The plot is about the Triwizard tournament, where each school's representative battled for the glory. But somehow Potter was chosen as the fourth contestant, and we have ourselves a fun and intense story. I was surprised and happy that I wasn't bored through another two and a half hours of this franchise. This is the first one that kept my interest throughout. Again, there were more unique wizard stuff that further expanded the universe. This was always fun to watch, and this movie still kept that tradition going. The first half actually was teen drama where the students went to a ball. The romance was more prominent, and even became naughty in some scenes. What drove the plot was the tournament, and the looming danger that hid beneath it throughout the runtime. When the imminent doom hit at around the last round of the tournament, the movie became vastly more intense. For the first time, I felt that Harry's life was in actual danger. As for problems, the runtime was still a tad bit long. Also, some of the rounds in the tournament were pretty weak an could have been more fun.

2321,Jordan M,"Apr 05, 2021","Newell did more things right here than Cuaron did with the third movie and it's not even close. He makes the most out of the lengthy runtime here by excising a lot of the subplots in the novel in an extremely successful way as it allowed more time to be spent on the climactic finale than had been allotted in any of the previous 3 movies. There was more interaction between the characters and a highly appreciable increase in comedy. The actors had grown up quite a lot and were doing better in each iteration at showing their acting range, with Hermione a particular highlight in this one. Doyle acquitted himself remarkably well, with his film score on par with Williams's previous three and the CGI had improved drastically even with only a year's time passing. Best of all was the source material itself as the underdog sports genre is probably my #1 favorite and the finale here is probably the best in the entire series, both the graveyard part and the quasi-epilogue reveal. I think Cuaron misunderstood the intended audience for these as his priorities seemed rooted solely in quality filmmaking instead of entertaining a mostly-teenaged audience, a concept Newell is apparently an expert at. The only criticism I have is that I think they could've found a few minutes to devote to the Quidditch World Cup instead of skipping the entire thing as that was one of the best chapters in the book!",Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Movie Reviews

2324,Swetha G,"Mar 18, 2021","The non-so magical review from a muggle. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a fantasy/adventure film directed by Mike Newell. It is based on J.K.Rowling's novel which was written in 2000 and carries the same name as the novel. It was released on November 23, 2005. It is as well the fourth part in the Harry Potter film series. Last Christmas, I saw this film and it was definitely one to remember. Just like past Harry Potter films this one didn't fail to amuse me. You could tell that this was filmed on a big-budget compared to the previous films of the series. To my mind I think this one offers a lot more than fantasy or adventure, it also gives you a lot of headspace to imagination. This piece of art surely left me astonished and filled with questions, wanting to watch the next part. As for the plot of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, it includes the three main characters to be grown up, as they enter their fourth year of the School of Wizardry and Witchcraft: Hogwarts. It holds a fair amount of violence, since Harry Potter, the main character has to enter the prestigious Triwizard Tournament as a minor and face some dreadful challenges along the way of becoming a champion. Throughout the film, new characters came to light. Some added a romantic aspect to the film, whereas others did not. For the 14-year-old Harry Potter, he endures pressure a normal teenager cannot handle to confront his biggest nightmare. With the help of his dearest friends, Hermione and Ron, he doesn't fail to succeed in the period of the tournament. After all, this is the year students prepare for the Yule Ball and dare to ask female students as their date to the ball. Yet, the charming part of the film quickly ends there, as Harry Potter will live up to his title as ‘The Boy Who Lived'. The Harry Potter series is known to leave every person astounded who is into fiction and/or fantasy. As for me, it was always a surprising experience watching through these films, as you notice the characters growing up from a young child to an adult. There is no doubt that J.K. Rowling is by far one of the most influential writers in our century. Not only, did she write several successful books but stands as a role model for young children and women. With the apparent cliffhanger at the end of the first film, it will leave you wanting more and you will end up watching the next films that follows up on the previous one. Personally, I am a lover of anything fictional, which is obvious why I am a fan of Harry Potter. Behind the success of these series, I suppose that watchers admire the films as they are not predicable as much as you think it would be. For instance, in this film, it gets quite dark quickly once you watch Harry get involved into life-or-death situations. Another example, is that Harry experiences tons of emotions in this film. As he goes through happy moments with his friends, he goes through the same amount of unknown moments and feelings. However, I must say that this is perhaps the most significant Harry Potter film so far. Mainly because, while I was watching this part of the series it felt like a mix of genres. Also, another example to why this film doesn't have a sole boring moment since it will keep introducing new characters throughout. For the Triwizard Tournament I mentioned earlier, there will be a ton of new, yet interesting characters added who bring a value to these films, which also was an enjoyable aspect. Lastly, this film was not excessively long but definitely long enough to tell the story. But there is one negative detail, that the films don't fully cover every single detail like the books do. So if you want to have a full understanding experience, I suggest you to also read the books so that you don't miss out on other details. Clearly, this masterpiece will be a hard one to forget, as it will stick to you for a longer time. It is not something that you will be able to forget soon, as it so famous. I would recommend this film to anyone who might be interest in fantasy and fictional characters. Furthermore, it is important to watch them in chronological order, since every film leaves a cliffhanger at the end which follows up on the next one. Lastly, I hope you get lost into the imagination of the magical world of Harry Potter, just like I did.",Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Movie Reviews

Something that this tape owed me was a better participation of Ron, since the appearance of Voldemort and Cedric totally overshadowed him, and they also made his character a bit like a crybaby and gossip, and I did not like that much.",Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Movie Reviews
2327,Hoan D,"Mar 06, 2021","Summary: This movie marks an important cornerstone in the development of the Harry Potter universe with the return of the Dark Lord Voldemort. It is set in Hogwarts during the fourth year of school, when the Triwizard Tournament takes place. It is a traditionally a competition between the three prominent schools of magic including Hogwarts, Durmstrang and Beauxbatons. Prior to the competition, the Goblet of Fire selects three students from each school to participate in the contest. Harry is unexpectedly selected and forced to enter the competition by the Goblet of Fire with three other students even though he never put his in the cup and he is also underage. Later, it is found out that one of the Voldemort's underlings cast an advanced spell on the Goblet to deceive it of Harry's age. During the first three rounds of the contest, Harry and the other students have to complete many difficult tasks such as rescuing underwater and fighting dragons. The climax of this movie comes when the four students compete to get out of the maze, the last round of the contest. However, Voldemort, still in his feeble from between dead and alive, and his underlings are in there waiting for the four, eventually killing Cedric from Hogwarts. Harry, after that, is capture, and his blood extracted and used to rebuild Voldemort into a strong physical form. Harry then duels against the Dark Lord for his life. He barely escapes Voldemort and eventually brings Cedric's body back to campus with the knowledge that Voldemort has returned. Analysis: The important turn of events in this movie heralds major change development of the storyline and the journey of Harry Potter as the main hero in this series. Harry is now no longer inherently safe from Voldemort like before when Harry's blood was has the magic against the Dark Lord. Now, both share the same blood as he used his Voldemort used Harry's blood to revive himself. Harry no longer is protected and now susceptible. He is now more representative of real-life heroes, who actually have vulnerabilities, not inherently indestructible by enemies as Harry used to be earlier in the series. This sharing of blood between Harry and Voldemort is also symbolistic of the struggles that real-life heroes have. It is like a connection across the dichotomy of good and evil, signaling the heroes also have their own evil side that they struggle against. Furthermore, when Harry's friend Ron turns against him, it further depicts Harry as a misunderstood hero. Ron estranged himself from Harry because Ron thinks that Harry intentionally enters himself into the contest for fame. However, later in the movie, Ron actually helps Harry to get through one of the dangerous rounds of the contest where the four students had to compete underwater. Ron's actions actually saved Harry's life. This part of the stories highlights the resilience of true friendship. No matter how significant the misunderstanding is, true friends will still help each other when in need and resolve the problem between them. Then when the four enter the last round of the tournament, the maze, Cedric encounters a minion of Voldemort, he is murdered by the killing curse. Then, Harry is captured by the other underlings of Voldemort. His arm is cut, and his blood collected to revive Voldemort. Harry has to duel against him for his life. He almost loses against the newly rejuvenated and strengthened Dark Lord. However, the souls of Harry's loved ones who were murdered by Voldemort appear from Voldemort's wand and give Harry's time to get to the Portkey to escape the maze. This scene demonstrates the theme of love's triumph over hate and evil. Critique: I love this movie and the whole Harry Potter series as a whole. There are, nonetheless, certain details that I think can be improved upon. The first one is rather a minor detail. It is when Dumbledore finds out the Goblet of Fire has chosen Harry as the fourth selectee to enter the tournament. The book says that Dumbledore ‘calmly' asks Harry if he actually put his name into the Goblet. However, the corresponding scene in the movie portraits Dumbledore's asking as aggressive and intimidating when he grabs Harry's arms and shakes them while questioning him. This minor detail, although does not affect the structural integrity of the storyline, somehow momentarily breaks the usual portrayal of Dumbledore as a gathered and calm man without serving any significant purpose. The second detail is when Harry is forced to enter the Tournament. J.K Rowling here could have better explained why it is that way, because the audience may have questions such as the following: Why is an underage forced to enter such a perilous contest even when he does not want to? Or Why can't/doesn't the administration do anything to keep Harry from the having to enter? Explanations to these questions can further strengthen the integral structure of the storyline. Overall, despite these small details that may be improved, I still give the movie 5 out of 5 stars.",Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire - Movie Reviews

2329,Leobardo V,4d ago,"The worst movie out of the trilogy, but really over hated. The reasons why people hate this movie is understandable, Peter Parker seems to have regressed on his love life which was developed and was seemed to be great as how the second movie ended, but in this film Peter Parker makes some decisions that make him a bad person when it comes to love and makes Mary Jane Watson feel not feel appreciated. Mary Jane Watson story is really not that good in this film they make her really dependent of a guy which in the comics, video-games, and TV shows/cartoons Mary Jane has always been an independent woman that takes care of herself most of the time. Villain wise this movie is also mid, out of the 3 villains, we only had one going into detail of why he was bad and why he took some decisions that made him a villain but only one had great character development and that was Sandman, for the other villain (New Green Goblin) we have had a background story of why he became a villain since the first film but to be fair they did do a good gob towards the end when it comes to that character. The main villain and the worst one is Venom, man came out of nowhere and managed to get into Peter Parker's apartment so easily without him realizing. Venom was a rushed character in this film, no background, man just landed on Earth from space and he only turned Peter Parker more into an anti-hero when Peter was his host but no interactions between Peter and Venom, also something to add, Venom turned into a suit which Peter easily took off and when Peter realized what was happening to him with Venom he struggles to take off his suit, makes no sense to me unless Venom realized Peter wanted him away so he just tried to stay with him. Once Venom reached Eddie Brook, it was more comic accurate but still a wasted villain nothing compared to the new Venom movies we have today. This movie is enjoyable but it is average at best compared to the other films.",Spider-Man 3,Spider-Man 3 - Movie Reviews
2330,Aidan B,5d ago,"A massive disappointment compared to the classic first two, ""Spiderman 3"" has a much shakier and convoluted story that tries to cram too much into its short runtime. The action is still pleasant, though the CGI somehow feels worse than the previous films. The villains are still good and memorable, though there are just too many to give any of them their time to shine. The direction that this film heads in is also very confusing, rewriting some important plot points and actions of the previous two films. Maguire, Dunst, and Franco are still very well in this movie though, and the acting of the villains is also on point. There are also a number of entertaining sequences, though most get overshadowed by the large amount of cringey and unnecessarily bad moments that make no sense. Overall, just a bad film that fails to conclude the ending that the previous installments deserved.",Spider-Man 3,Spider-Man 3 - Movie Reviews
2331,Martin F,6d ago,"The trilogy ends on a confusing note. It's a really hard film to follow, there is so many stories here and all of them seems underdeveloped. The characters development which was what I preferred in the first two movies, doesn't feel relatable anymore outside few moments (most of the time during the scenes with Aunt Jay, the voice of reason). The big point of the movie was adapting the Venom arc, and the movie fails in every way. Venom feels very secondary, I would even say that if you remove everything about him the movie would be as ""coherent"" that it is. I know it's ""iconic"" now in a too bad is good kind of way, but for me the Peter Parker/Venom scenes was a secondhand embarrassment. I felt bad for the characters and I even felt bad for Tobey Maguire having to play these scenes. It's simply cringe. The special effects sometimes feel too ambitious for the time, they go overboard with the action scenes giving you tense moment but very noticeable green screens or CGI. It was a time where we qualify action movies as CGI messes and Spider-man 3 is the perfect example. The end is a little too cheesy and too easy.",Spider-Man 3,Spider-Man 3 - Movie Reviews

2333,Liam B,"Nov 15, 2021","I don't think there is a person out there that believes this is the best film in the trilogy. While it turns Spider-Man in a direction that I don't particularly like, I still find that this film shows some of the charm of the first two. I can tell this film was made with care and love, but I can also tell that the studio got their hands on it and turned, what I'm sure was a great plan from Sam Raimi, into a mess of too many villains and plots. I would have love to have seen a movie with Just Harry as the Green Goblin or Just the Sandman. I don't like the inclusion of Venom in the slightest, to me, Toby's Spider-Man is supposed to be a great lighthearted guy, the ultimate nice/good guy, and I loved that. But, the symbiote turns Toby into a dark individual that I don't think fits the series. For example, The Spider-Man from the 90's animated series was a great Spider-Man to use the symbiote with. While he was a great guy, and one of my favorite Spider-Men ever, he wasn't the ultimate nice guy that Toby's Spider-Man was on the big screen. They used the symbiote much earlier in his arc, season 1 of a 5 season show, at a time when he was still arrogant and immature, as opposed to a Spider-Man who had already progressed through 2 films. The version of Spider-Man in the animated series was much more self-centered and was a much better match for the symbiote. Overall, I like this movie, but I don't like Peter for some of it, and a can't help to think what could have been.",Spider-Man 3,Spider-Man 3 - Movie Reviews

2341,Jonathan K,"Oct 09, 2021","Honestly this movie isn't nearly as terrible as a lot of people claim - it's just a movie where the desires of the talented filmmakers were overridden by those of an executive. Primarily, Sam Raimi, the brilliant filmmaker who made the first two (in addition to the wonderful Evil Dead trilogy) did not want to make a Venom movie, as he considered Venom a boring villain, but the studio forced his hand to do it anyway. And as such, this is a movie made by instruction, made be a director that made the preceding entries out of passion. Combine this with some numerous production complications and self-proclaimed genius Danny Elfman refusing to write the music because he felt Raimi didn't appreciate his unbridled genius, and you've got a movie with massive, massive problems just due to happenstance. And it's actually rather sad, as much about the movie actually works very well -- The climax is hugely entertaining and ends with a moment of resolve, rather than defeat, the way Peter finally stands against Harry are actually quite cathartic, and the new Composer's musical score is much better than the forgettable-at-best fluff that we got from the previous two movies (as let's be real - the wonderful main theme was the only piece of music from the first two movies worth listening to). There's some efficient (yet widely misunderstood) comedy bits in this movie, and it is interesting to see not only Parker himself becoming increasingly violent, but one of the main villains increasingly, of his own accord, becomes a more and more volatile person, making him a good villain. If you loved the first two I'd ultimately recommend this one - the only real reason I hesitate is that there are some depressing ""my dreams never came true"" beats that come up during the story, but so long as you acknowledge that it's not nearly as good.",Spider-Man 3,Spider-Man 3 - Movie Reviews

Despite the cast (the only good actors are Rosemary Harris, JK Simmons and James Franco), the villains are good. There is more action in this movie than in the other two combined, and I loved it because Peter Parker's arc was something I always felt bored watching. And this film is more than an emo Peter Parker. This emo Peter makes sense, I finally managed to have empathy for the protagonist, and the conclusion is perfect and touching. I ended the film proud of Peter. Finally, if I said the first film isn't that good, and the second one is good but overrated, this third one is underrated and deserves more than a ""cult"" status.",Spider-Man 3,Spider-Man 3 - Movie Reviews

2351,Sean L,"Sep 21, 2021","At the onset of his third big-picture treatment, we find young Peter Parker in an unfamiliar predicament: he's genuinely happy! Almost annoyingly so, in fact. Even his longtime love interest, Mary Jane Watson, seems to think he's laying it on too thick and tries to tell him as much in a series of awkward, abbreviated conversations between crime-fighting bouts. Parker pays no mind, of course, produces a string of awful motivational speeches when she needs emotional support and swiftly swings himself straight back onto the singles scene. Well, that didn't take long. Now Spidey is sad again! Just in time to tangle with three(!) competing super-villains, a rival in the workplace and a major league identity crisis. Not unlike its predecessors, Spider-Man 3 has way too much going on, a problem that's ballooned with each subsequent installment. The first two films manage to succeed in spite of this weakness, persevering with a great shared cast, strong character moments and well-earned payoffs. In those films, Pete's best pal Harry Osborn slowly works his way through a patient, simmering villainous turn. Here, he's abruptly hot-shotted in the opening action scene, carelessly reset and cast aside until the finale. Venom is birthed and dispensed in less than an act. Sandman's arc has enough emotional heft to single-handedly carry the counter narrative, but he always feels like a third wheel. Gwen Stacey pops in and out of the frame at random. There's just no room for these subplots to breathe amidst all the frantic competition, the race to grab every last thread and hurriedly weave them into something loosely resembling a story. Maybe with a touch of nuance and panache, a skilled director could have worked a little magic and turned this troubled script into an acceptable early-period superhero flick. Sam Raimi is anything but a nuanced director. At best, he's capable but limited, habitually caught in the act of winking at his own shortcomings in uniquely entertaining ways. No wonder he's best regarded for his gleefully deranged horror movies, where over-stressed people behave irrationally (and a little comically) in high-pressure situations. Under ideal circumstances, he can incorporate his eccentricities into the fabric of a film without negatively affecting its story, but not with so many other jobs on his plate. I'm not sure if the hammy over-acting is his fault or the stars', but I tend to lean toward the former because it's so hopelessly widespread. Nothing feels natural in this film, from the janky dialogue and clumsy delivery to the rushed primary character arc and dated special effects. I can still remember how this felt in the theater, bad enough that I avoided revisiting it for nearly fifteen years, and it hasn't improved with time. I can see bits and pieces of promise dotted here and there, hints that the overachieving Spider-Man 2 wasn't just a fluke, but they're drowned by the hurry to expand an already-crowded universe and get everything back to an unconvincing status quo in time for the closing credits.

2364,Cailan D,"Aug 06, 2021","In many ways, Spider-Man 3 is structurally the same as its two predecessors: Peter starts out the movie as Spider-Man and the villains, who aren't inherently villains, become so as the movie progresses. The biggest difference this time is that there are two villains rather than one and Peter plays a big part in why the villains are fighting him. In many ways, this same structure works to the film's benefit and gives us some interesting characters and nice action sequences. It's another example of if a system isn't broken, don't fix it. SM 3 also adds a lot of depth to Peter's relationships with those around him, which becomes especially important as Peter changes throughout the film in pretty drastic ways that have big consequences for him. SM 3 is a movie that exemplifies that concept that you can be your own worst enemy. The acting is pretty good overall, although there is a casting choice that to this day I'm not a big fan of. The effects in the movie have slightly raised the bar from the previous films, making this a slight improvement from SM and SM 2. All that said, SM 3 is a bit of a letdown and isn't as good as the other two. Many scenes lack the directorial and written finesse than they had in the first two which causes some scenes to feel really awkward and a bit disruptive to the flow of the film. The dialogue is a bit cheesy at times and there are some scenes that don't make a lot of sense. Sandman and Venom are decent villains but they aren't quite as good as Green Goblin and Doc Ock were, which is partially because they come from different plotlines so there isn't as much time to develop their characters as there would optimally be. One of the biggest issues of SM 3 is exactly that: there are a bunch of storylines going on at once so the movie doesn't have a clear and direct focus for a lot of its runtime, so certain things don't get the development they deserve. The film balances all these stories as well as it can and overall does a decent job, but there are things that could've been explored a bit more. The ending has an emotional punch to it to nicely caps off the trilogy and should leave viewers satisfied enough as the credits roll. SM 3 is undoubtedly a letdown from its two predecessors but is a decent enough movie to be watchable and enjoyable at times.",Spider-Man 3,Spider-Man 3 - Movie Reviews

I recommend Casino Royale, Skyfall and No Time To Die when it comes to a typical binge on the Daniel Craig Bond movies and recommend Quantum Of Solace and SPECTRE just once.

2414,Patrick D,"Nov 20, 2021",So overall I like the movie but it could have been so much better. I just think they try to tie things in way too much with this.

2415,Luke J,"Nov 17, 2021","Spectre is an entertaining and overlong spy thriller. Although it fails to reach the heights of Casino Royal or Skyfall- Spectre is a watchable, and often quite fun Bond movie. The action is great, cinematography is beautiful, performances are generally good, but the writing is fairly sloppy. Trying to have Blofeld become the one behind all of Bond's previous troubles is clearly retconning- and doesn't work great. Having Blofeld be Bond's jealous step-brother is just plain stupid- how would Bond not recognize someone he grew up with? The pacing is also a big problem. The opening is great with an amazing tracking shot followed by great action. In the middle act things slow down considerably, and the story isn't engaging enough to warrant it. Then the final act tries to squeeze in too much, and despite some great action it is jarring the way things jump from one event to the next so abruptly. It waits until the last 40 minutes to finally reveal the villain and have him interact with Bond- then we get an extended monologue, torture scene, and escape scene within a less than 20 minutes or less. The way Bond goes from having his brain scrambled to moments later being a deadeye shot, blowing up the entire base and escaping- is just silly and shows how carelessly some of the sequences were put together. There are a handful of other times where the logic just doesn't add up. Walken delivers a very hammy performance as Blofeld, a totally cartoonish villain when compared against previous Craig- Bond villains. All that said- this is a Bond movie with lots of style, great action, exotic locals, beautiful women, wonderful camera work, and a solid central performance by Craig (who is easily my favorite Bond).",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

2418,Toby H,"Nov 14, 2021","Spectre is another entertaining and engaging Craig outing, even if a slight step back from Skyfall. Watch it for Waltz, he's as masterful as ever. We're glad Craig opted to avoid any ghosts and do one more.",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews
2419,Stefan Z,"Nov 13, 2021","Ah yes, the one that thinks it's Captain America: The Winter Soldier, but is actually Austin Powers in Goldmember. This is definitely a goofy Bond movie masquerading as serious one. I actually watched this twice in the theatres when it came out. That's how much I loved it at the time. I now know I was forcing myself to accept the glaring awful writing. I never particularly liked the writing even back then, but justified liking it for other aspects like directing, cinematography, musical score, action set pieces, and having the best costume design in the series. That last one I still believe. Just like how the jarring editing in tandem with poor blocking weighs the overall quality of Quantum of Solace down, so too does the writing of Spectre. Skyfall had some ridiculous plot holes as well but there were other aspects of the writing keeping it from being a totally trash script unlike this one. Thomas Newman's score is even better than I remember. I think I might even prefer it to his Skyfall score. However, the cinematography is way worse. For some reason I thought the super saturated sepia filter was present only in the cold open in Mexico, which would be bad enough, but it's like that throughout the film. Not a fan ever usually of sepia and here its at a whole other tier. I do really like Bautista's character. One of my favourite henchman honestly. The Austin Martin DB10 is one of my favourite Bond cars ever. It's number one of the modern cars (modern equals Brosnan and Craig eras). The car chase in Rome is decent, not as bad as some die hard fans say it is. I liked it. I would have preferred Rome be in winter to somewhat try to justify the lack of traffic. There definitely were some vehicles in the way, but perhaps not enough. Back to the writing. The C stuff that M is dealing with makes no sense. Dont they already have information on everyone? What exactly is going to change with having more of it? The Blofeld stuff makes absolutely no sense. Brothers? Seriously? not only is that bad by itself, it makes the world of of the entire series so much smaller. Bond also has to deal with him on his own by the end. Where is the rest of all his minions? and why in the old MI6 building? How did Bond shoot down a plane with a pistol (ok that one I always had a problem with, but now with everything else, it just feels even worse. When were they (Bond and Madeline) falling in love exactly? Because it wasn't in this movie. Speaking of which, never in this series have I seen more nonsensical reasons for having sex since The Man with the Golden Gun. Neither times did it feel appropriate. One of them was done for laughs and I wasn't laughing. some jokes actually do work though, the writing isn't absolute garbage. I like Q and a lot of his lines, most of the time. I like the Sam Smith theme song less and less every time I hear it. When it first came out, I loved it, was in my top 5 of all Bond themes. By now it's somewhere close to the bottom 5 for me if not already there. The graphic of the theme song is probably even worse honestly. Some weird shadows over people's faces going on. The cold open isn't even as great as I remember. No only is the sepia filter so overbearingly distracting, the first cut from the long take happens at a pretty random and awkward moment.",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

2422,Jean L,"Oct 30, 2021",Spectre continues the story of Daniel Craig as James Bond and unfortunately is not one of the strongest instalments of this franchise. In here James Bond is tested by one of its toughest opponents yet Ernst Blofeld played by Christoph Waltz who is set to take over all the intelligence agencies of the world and make the world bow to him through an organization called Spectre. Craig here continues to kick ass and in here is struggling with the passing of M as played by Judy Dench. Now the mantle is taken over by the great Ralph Fiennes who is not as caring as Dench's M but is more stern and direct and gets in more sparring moments with Bond. The meat of the story though is the '' Bond Female'' played by the great French actress Lea Seydoux of Blue is the Warmest color fame. This is the best female character for this franchise since Casino Royale and establishes a romance that has great consequences for the story. Unfortunately even with Sam Mendes back as director this movie pales in comparison to Skyfall. Is convoluted with a very long dull pace and despite the great performance by Waltz this villain is quite disappointing with a very disappointing climax. This film could have been so much better,Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

Blofeld, played by Christoph Waltz, is kinda wasted in the movie, which is disappointing because Waltz is such a masterful actor and he could have had a much larger presence in the movie.

2429,Nathan D,"Oct 10, 2021","Spectre is satisfactory with a lot of elements that hold up throughout the whole film. Yet, several components get lost in the story that is not to the capacity it should be at. The story is flawed and does not flow right. This problem is apparent in the character arc of the villain. Just like Quantum of Solace, Spectre handles its villain terribly. Ernst Stavro Blofeld's story is so muddled with very little explanation. There is a lot of verbal exposition, but never any visual storytelling. Blofeld's storyline is a victim of this problem as the film had a near 150-minute screen duration yet can not show any relevant information. However, the film can get one of the Bond girls right and not just have Léa Seydoux be the sexual one-off that Monica Bellucci is. Speaking of Bellucci, she is part of a weak opening. Bellucci should have never been in the movie since her character is a misfire. Spectre is the fourth film in this version of the franchise, and the filmmakers should know that they need to treat their characters better. The film also has a mixed bag in the technical aspects of the film. The cinematography is bland, with hardly any shots that are visually appealing. The film uses the hand-held camera too much and focuses on the wrong details. One of those two problems is more at the fault of Sam Mendes as his directing is a step-down from Skyfall. Mendes does not fulfill the concept and story of this movie in an orderly fashion. There are various moments in the film where it feels like a parody of a Bond movie that you would see on a sketch show. The cast is at fault here with some weak performances from multiple actors. Daniel Craig is at his lowest point in Spectre with a very emotionless performance. Craig delivered this fun cockiness in the other films, but here he exhibits a bland personality. Christoph Waltz is solid, yet it is hard to see the range of his character when Waltz has very little screen time. Léa Seydoux is also a decent actor in the ensemble, and it was nice to see that she had a strong sense of emotion in times of uncertainty. Dave Bautista is a prominent addition to the cast and adds some much-needed variety to the film. Ben Whishaw is a delight in the role Q, yet he was missing that spark that he had in Skyfall. Lastly, there is Ralph Fiennes. Fiennes is excellent as M, and it was nice to see M expanded on with Fiennes making him a more likable character. Spectre is a misfire in the James Bond franchise, yet does have a few redeeming qualities in some of its departments. The story has a few bumps, and Sam Mendes is not doing the best work he can. However, Spectre is watchable as that is one highlighting aspect with any of these James Bond movies. Read more reviews like this at postcreditreviews.com",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

2435,David M,"Oct 08, 2021","Like Quantum Of Solace, this is a film that is destined to suffer by virtue of being a sequel to its predecessor; in this film's sake, to possibly the best Bond film of them all. Once again like Quantum of Solace, this film benefits from revisiting long after initial release; though the action sequences and the over-arching plot are closer to the entertainingly over-the-top traditions of much earlier in the series, this is never over-egged. The balance is in fact just about right, and there are moments of direction and design that provide a visual impact that's quite unlike much I can remember in any other film in the series. It is too long - when Bond says 'this isn't over yet just' before we cut to the film's denouement from what we all expected to be the denouement when we saw it first time around, it's tempting to find yourself saying 'Really?'. The 4 (or will it be 5?) film arc of the plot requires this extra ending and whilst it does mean the film outstays its welcome a little, it's an undeniably well-executed final finale. That there are at least 2 Daniel Craig Bond films better than this (I'm writing this before seeing No Time To Die) could sound like a criticism, but on its own terms and with the benefit of time, this is a comfortable success.",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

It's not a great film, but I'd argue better than this one. Worse yet, this film is overlong and slow as sin. There's a couple of good action sequences, the cast is good, and treating it's female lead as more than it's male leads disposable condom are all great. The cinematography is decent too, but all this is wasted with the stupid twist done decades earlier and better in the film mentioned earlier, as well as a tendency to become formulaic, which HORRIFIES me. I HATE what this movie does to this movie's villain. It's too nostalgia-baity and pandering. I give this a 4/10. I'm scared No Time To Die might be just as unoriginally stupid from what I've heard.

2443,Lequisha S,"Oct 05, 2021","They legitimately borrowed an Austin Powers Goldmember plot point with their hackneyed attempt at creating emotional resonance between Bond and Christoph Waltz' blofeld. This movie recycled so much from previous films in the Craig era. It tried to give 007 a Bond girl that he truly cared for, but there was none of the chemistry and flair Casino Royale had in the Bond-Vesper relationship. It tried to do the secret organization pulling the strings bit that Quantum of Solace did with Mr. White and the Quantum organization. It tried to do the villain-has-personal-attachment-to-Bond thing that Skyfall did. And on all three fronts, it failed miserably. Worst of all, there were so many dull points in the movie. If you won't have the depth or subversiveness of the better Bond entries, at least have interesting action.",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

I thought the action, as in pretty much all Bond films, was the standout for me. The train sequence was brilliantly choreographed and the climatic scene added some spectacular set piece action that will be etched into the Bond archives. Performance wise all good as expected once more, however Christoph Waltz as the films leading antagonist provided his usual demonic demeanour and his appreance weaves nicely into the narrative that had been building through the films prior to Spectre. This certainly does no harm to a group of films that has built itself up, especially since Craig has been at the helm, as one of the best action franchises of all time.",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

2447,MSBReviews .,"Sep 29, 2021","Rating: B ""Spectre fails to reach the tremendous potential of its intriguing narrative and fascinating antagonist, but Sam Mendes still pulls off a decent James Bond flick. The screenplay raises significant issues with an incredibly dull subplot that deeply affects the pacing of a bloated runtime. In addition to this, Christoph Waltz's lack of impactful screentime is disappointing, to say the least, despite a brilliant performance from the actor. Fortunately, the jaw-dropping action set pieces elevate the overall film, which also benefits from gorgeous cinematography (Hoyte van Hoytema) and exceptional acting across the board. Daniel Craig and Léa Seydoux's characters relationship is emotionally compelling, making Bond's mission feel more like an interesting personal journey. One of the best movies of the franchise is buried somewhere under the messy screenplay, but what can be found at the surface has much to appreciate.""",Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

The pacing was atrocious, especially because I feel like they could have ended it at the two hour mark, with slight modifications, if any, and called it there. Hey, they brought back other Bond tropes I didn't like, such as storylines just being dropped and never brought back up again. The characters are also a bit flat this time around, the soundtrack's kind of generic, and Daniel Craig is as mumbly as ever, but he does deliver on the actions scenes, so he's done a solid job overall making this his Bond. The visual effects were well done, with neither distracting CGI of most modern blockbusters, nor the awkward mistakes of the 60s/70s/80s. The comic relief is good, and at the end of the day, this is still more interesting than some of the worst ones of the 70s and 80s. I'm really hoping the quality of Skyfall returns, like Bond has 24 times now. I will say, however, the surveillance stuff was timely commentary for 2015 the way Tomorrow Never Dies' was in 1997, and to this day for both, so they were at least trying.",SHOW MORE,Spectre,Spectre - Movie Reviews

Tom Holland does very well in his portrayal of both Spiderman and Peter Parker, and the villain, played by Michael Keaton, is one of the more memorable villains in the MCU. However, the main issue I have with this film is that Spiderman never feels like his own hero, just like Tony Stark's shadow, up until the end of course. Even the villain, however, doesn't even have any conflict with Peter, he just feels like a villain that would fight against the Avengers, or more specifically, Tony Stark. I feel like the film relied too much on Tony Stark and never came out of his shadow. The film in general, however, was still fun to watch and it's one that I've seen several times, it's just that there are a few issues that I have with it.",Spider-Man: Homecoming,Spider-Man: Homecoming - Movie Reviews

2464,Rafael R,"Oct 28, 2021","My favourite Spider-Man movie. Tom Holland's version of the hero is the most human between the main trio (him, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield). He's a real teenager: anxious, acts by impulse, he's the Spider-Man who most want to be a hero. Most people complain that Tony Stark replaced Uncle Ben in MCU. I completely disagree. When Peter met Tony he already was Spider-Man by around six months. Uncle Ben has already died and Stark was someone who gave Peter a purpose. His turnaround sentence is the best I saw in a Spider-Man movie. But a Spider-Man movie isn't only made of Spider-Man. We have Peter Parker's arc outside the suit as well. And it's excellent. The high school environment looks like a high school environment (the best friend, the bully, the crush, the cynical, everyone is here and they're great characters) and Tom Holland is the most charismatic and trustworthy Peter Parker (as a teenager, he looks and acts like one) and his chemistry with Laura Harrier (Liz) is undeniably cute. Finally, Vulture is an excellent villain: he's imposing, has a motivation that makes sense, and despite not having Spider-Man as a direct enemy, is a person who is next to Peter and had the superhero interfering in his plans. My only issue with this movie is Aunt May, who is constantly treated like a MILF, and that joke is the only one that is repetitive and never works. It's sad because Marisa Tomei is a good actress and has the perfect age-looking for the role.",Spider-Man: Homecoming,Spider-Man: Homecoming - Movie Reviews

2472,Marco B,"Sep 16, 2021","Spider-Man finally gets a full length MCU treatment in this (sort-of) reboot to the franchise. Tom Holland is probably the most accurate portrayal of our young hero, Peter Parker, as he deals with the after math of working with Iron Man's Avengers (see Civil War). Peter is an easy-going fun loving kid who wants the girl, to impress Tony Stark, and to be popular. The positive in this film is that it is a real coming of age tale with a kid trying to deal with being a kid. Even our villain, The Vulture, is excellently played by (my favourite Batman) Michael Keaton, who has less of a plan and is just plain greedy. This film suffered from a lack of consequences as Peter has nothing really to lose, only his potential position in the Avengers, which isn't that big a deal. The other problem with this film is it can't decide whether it's a teen flick, action movie, coming of age tale or an origin story. Because of this, the plot and pacing can be off at times, but the acting makes up for this as Spidey really shines through.",Spider-Man: Homecoming,Spider-Man: Homecoming - Movie Reviews

Of course that's not putting down the brilliant Spider-Man 2 from Sam Rami, however this movie is the one I gravitate towards when wanting to put on a Spider-Man film. The Amazing cast really helps push the movie to a higher level with 'Tom Holland' playing Peter Parker/Spider-Man this is the first time I actually believed the actor could actually be in high school whereas former iterations who looked in there mid 20s. Tom Holland to me plays both Spider-Man & Peter brilliantly with Michael Keaton also doing a superb job as the movies villain 'The Vulture' Michael manages to make you feel bad and understand the character one moment then makes you fear him the next, You have to give props to the actor when his powerless character is threatening a superhuman and you are actually worried for the latter.

2475,Stephy S,"Sep 04, 2021","An action-packed coming of age story full of laughs and engaging fight sequences, Spider-Man Homecoming is a cheesy story that doesn't take itself too seriously but still makes time for heartfelt scenes that show who Peter Parker is as a person. The CGI from Marvel is phenomenal, as to be expected. The plot is your average light hearted Marvel plot and it works about as well as you'd expect, the writing isn't some magnum opus but it's decent enough for it to be forgiven. The cast is however a bit hit or miss, Robert Downey Jr is charismatic and a blast as always and Michael Keaton is insidious and one of the better Marvel villains, but we can't speak about the cast without talking about its rendition of Spider-man aka Peter Parker. Tom Holland is truly fantastic, he's cheesy, he's quippy, he's charming, he's everything you could ever want out of a Spider-Man, and most importantly, he's having fun in the role. Unfortunately, outside of these three, the rest of the cast is pretty forgettable. The pacing while at times too fast is never terrible.

It became more complicated with more mystery and unpredictable twists. The threat was more alarming and prominent to the whole school. There was also a bigger danger to Harry and his trio, which made me more invested in them. Even though I was more interested in the story, the run time was a big issue.

2529,Puroo R,"May 08, 2021","After watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone I had gotten really high hopes for the Harry Potter franchise. I was expecting all of them to be as simplistic and visually appealing as that movie. With that in mind I watched the second movie today and sadly, it doesn't live up to the mark on almost any of the parameters. That's not to say that it's a bad movie. It's not. But it's not a good Harry Potter movie. To begin with, the movie's CGI hasn't aged pretty well. And that's actually really surprising because the first one was so good so this one should have had a higher budget and thus more advanced VFX. But other than the Basilisk, most of the CGI hasn't aged so well. Especially that of Dobby. When he was banging his head in the drawer in the beginning of the movie, the shelves of the drawer were shaking in the opposite direction of where they should shake. And when Harry puts Dobby in the wardrobe it looked more like the wind is opening the door instead of Dobby. There are plenty of examples of bad CGI in the movie but I don't want to take it too far. Speaking of Dobby, he's had a very bad introduction. The way he is behaving is annoying. If I were to behave like that my mom would have slapped me all across the face. Sure he does get a wholesome ending, but that's yet to see how he turns out. Draco also became more annoying now, with constantly trying to bully Harry even though he can't do a thing. Myrtle spoke like a nerd Harley Quinn. I get this movie is trying to be campy, but that goes way too far. The story is a good part here. Although it's not as easy as Sorcerer's Stone, it is still very nicely detailed. Too many incidents happen in it, but yet it does not feel bloated. It feels absolutely to the point, with none of that ""side quest"" things movies often use to pad the runtime. Everything happens for a reason and it all pays off in the end. The scenes with Ron, particularly in the beginning, are always funny and memorable. Though Hermione doesn't play as huge part in this movie as Harry and Ron do, she also gets a decent screen time, although without any character arc. I'm still on the second movie of this franchise, so I can't exactly say if this is among the good movies or the bad ones. But I really hope the rest of the movies are more leaning towards the first one in terms of tone. I remember every scene right now, but I can see myself forgetting most of the parts in the next few months.",Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets - Movie Reviews

2577,Jacob J D,"Jun 28, 2021","""The Secret Life of Pets 2"" was made to teach new parents a lesson Sometimes I feel like Max, the Jack Russell Terrier. As much as I want to be like Rooster, the cool and collective sheepdog, sometimes my nervous and over-protective energy can get the best of me as most new parents have realize in the beginning years. As if Illumination was thinking of me when producing the script, they decided to name the baby Max is zealously protecting over as Liam my own toddler's name. I was only expecting childish fun gags and witty observations about the animals that rule our lives. Never thought the film's moral compass was to make me feel less alone with Max complaining ""why is the world so dangerous"" as I try to prevent my little ones from hitting themselves into pesky edges in our household. True, this theme is a minor element in this entertaining, energetic, and humorous sequel that should satisfy fans of the original. However, being present in the most important subplot reminded me that the most important lessons can come from unexpected places. As Rooster (perfect voice casting portraying the gruff, aloof, grit, and authenticity of Harrison Ford) said to Max after he reflected paranoia of Liam possibly falling, ""so what if he falls? He will just get back up."" It's a perfect metaphor that we can't protect our kids at all times forever, to let them go to grow experimenting as Max put it in the end this ""complex, scary and beautiful world."" Following the model example of Rooster, Max learns to face his own fears giving an example of bravery and courage as a result to Liam. Of course, most people are not going in seeking out these themes in this animated feature rather a visual vibrant, well-pace, and fun time that doesn't outstay its welcome. This film hit that mark overall even feeling more so like an episodic Saturday cartoon. I say that because the structure is unusual considering there is three subplots that feels like three separate episodes that in the end interconnect for a finale. This lack of lasered focus linear structured plot results in a thin story that questions if a sequel only exits simply because its predecessor was a box office success. Nevertheless, at least the themes and lessons learned mentioned earlier intertwines with the three main characters in the final act. At times it seems a bit mature for the younger audience with multiple suspenseful tense scenes however even my toddler son took it well as if he were inspired to become Rooster himself. The voice cast is pitch perfect and strong all around that brings relevance and charm to these characters that will support a healthy fan base looking forward to the next entry. Thank you for the lesson Harrison Ford.",The Secret Life of Pets,The Secret Life of Pets 2 - Movie Reviews

Anyone who knows psychology or who has suffered recovering from mental illness knows that kind all-to-common action gets people killed. I can't help but remember a friend who introduced me to that movie who during that exact scene and said, ""I like that dog."" ... as he refused to awknowledge or respect a mental illness his daughter was struggling with; and was just exacerbating her condition. It could have been a decent feel-good movie if it hadn't had that scene. But that scene turned it from a potential tool for healing and recovery to slipping glass shards in the medicine bottle.

2611,Late R,"May 24, 2020","‘The Secret Life of Pets' was a pretty average animated film whose ""what do our pets get up to when we're not around"" premise made it relatable, funny and charming to pet owners/lovers. The sequel has practically nothing to do with its title anymore (you can only pull that trick once, after all) and loses anything that made it somewhat original. Now we're into very familiar animated-animal territory that we've all seen many times before. Sure, there are some good messages (albeit very standard stuff) and a few things that'll probably make you smile, but for the most part, as with its predecessor, it's not particularly memorable and, in fact, the most stand-out thing is the colourful animation (the backgrounds are lovely) and character design. In short, kids might enjoy it and there are a few moments that might catch your attention, but for most adults, there's not much here.",The Secret Life of Pets,The Secret Life of Pets 2 - Movie Reviews

2648,V T,"Oct 01, 2021","I've watched the movie for a total of 4 times and let me tell you something (two times on HBO and 2 second more on a pirate site): The movie is utterly garbage and unbearable to watch, even with the Utimate Cut. Till now, i still don't know why people are praising a poorly-written movie with extremely low pacing and dogshit performances, maybe because everyone can have diferrent opinions about a subjective subject i guess. Nonetheless, the movie is still something worth to be buried somewhere else outside of this world, far from our reach. There are many problems with the movie, but the biggest problem of all was the plot. It was just unbelievably stupid and corny, left the Martha scene alone. Don't get me wrong, i don't have any personal hate on Snyder but this movie is just something else beyond the conception of intelligence. I refuse to think that this was made by a decent human being. It's like watching a Neil Breen movie for Christ sake, everything is completely a trainwrecking mess. None of the details in it made sense in a way that a nornal mind can conprehend; how can a hateful, violent, gruesome vilgilante somehow found a immigrant alien to be hostile and then spare him the moment he knew that they had the same mother's name? Oh yeah, i know why, because the movie didn't bother to consider the logical thinking of the plot or the self-development of the characters that involved in it so they just did what they thought that be the (least) logical thing to ease the discord between the two. To summarise all of it in one sentence: it's a plain stupid movie.",Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice - Movie Reviews

Surely there has to be more to it than that for such big names as Affleck, Fishburne, Adams. Et Al. The directing is amongst the most hopelessly muddled that I've ever seen in my 65+ years of cinema involvement. (My father was a cinema manager, so that had a bearing on me seeing far, far more movies all through my youth than my contemporaries who had to buy their seats.). But this thing would have had me desirous of a rebate, especially bearing in mind the price of cinema tickets these days, (my days of freebie tickets ended - unfortunately - about thirty years back) The screenplay and dialogue is poor, poor stuff indeed. And - Superman as, effective,y, - a villain? What? I'm reduced to using terms not unrelated to those of abuse in another circumstance. It is crap, it is junk, it is unwatchable dross. Don't buy the DVD, but by all means if you're curious to see how bad a flick Hollywood is capable of turning out despite a vast budget, check it on Amazon Video.

The action scenes sometimes work (the underwater opener and the man v tank showdown) but some are just over the top craziness.

2657,Taekwondo Life M,"Mar 18, 2021","Everything about this sequel to Wolf Warrior exceeds the first. The acting, the special effects, the story- all an improvement over the original installment. Wu Jing returns in this sequel. He also wrote, produced, and directed the film. The film surrounds Wu Jing's attempt to live a peaceful life in Africa when he his peace is disrupted by a mercenary army and a deadly disease outbreak. One of my criticisms of the first film was that I did not feel Wu Jing commanded the screen as the lead. Nothing could be further from the truth in this one. Rather than playing a Jackie Chan-esq character, Wu King finds his own as a compelling, interesting, and exciting action star in this one. He is very good. As for the supporting cast- Frank Grillo is always fun to watch. He appears to be the hardest working action star/character in the world. His fight with Jing in the finale of the film is well choreographed. Celina Jade is commanding as the love interest. Nwachukwu Kennedy Chukwuebuka steals every scene he is in as Jing's ""Godson"". This movie was one of the highest grossing pictures of all time. Sam Hargrave, martial artist, stuntman, and Director of the highly successful ""Extraction, stunt choreographed the underwater fight as well as many of the action scenes. This explains a lot about its success. This one is worth watching. The ending foreshadows a ""Part 3"" and I hope it is at least as good as the sequel.",Wolf Warrior 2,Wolf Warrior II - Movie Reviews
2658,Jonathan K,"Jan 19, 2021","In terms of production and narrative machinations, this is a far more complicated movie than its predecessor, so props to Wu Jing on his Directing of this film to have it work; it's not some of the best Directing you'll see by any stretch (the acting is mediocre and some of the cinematography is really rather bland), but it flows and it functions without any actual structural problems, which most certainly isn't nothing. People came to watch Action, and this movie Stars and is Directed by one of the most underappreciated Action stars working today. As such, the action is almost always from Good to Excellent, and the story-beats, while somewhat thread-bare, are enough to keep the momentum up. I was also shocked as to how much had actually happened by the end of the movie, as the amount crammed into the movie feels like it was a full hour longer (not a complaint, just an observation), as it ends with a prolonged fight scene that ends up with him battling a tank. The movie does often times come off as a bit pretentious at times, as it features heroes protecting unarmed citizens from trigger-happy killers, but it really just boils down to being an excuse to have some really cool action sequences; the movie does make you empathize for the refugees, but their part in the movie is really just a trick to generate a sense of empathy from the viewer. There is also a very, very strong Chinese Military Patriotism element in this movie, making it also feel like a Chinese Michael Bay film, but I don't count this against the movie because it makes sense (being a film made in China) and because it's actually purely a positive message - It uses heroism to bestow Patriotic Propaganda but doesn't use it to justify any morally grey misdeeds on the part of the heroes (I mean, it's literally about soldiers protecting unarmed civilians under fire). If you want a fun time you will find it in this movie, which is explosive, full of stunts, and works well on a technical level as well.",Wolf Warrior 2,Wolf Warrior II - Movie Reviews

Beaucoup plus sympathique en mercenaire au grand coeur qu'en soldat de l'armée chinoise, Wu Jing est aussi accompagné de Celina Jade et surtout de Frank Grillo, qui se délecte à jouer les salopards. Tout ceci serait une bonne nouvelle si Wolf Warrior II n'était pas un film aussi abject au niveau idéologique, considérant que l'Afrique est un continent inférieur, une zone de non-droit avec une population gentille mais ne servant que de chair à canon pour les bienfaits de l'action (on ne compte pas moins de 6 massacres filmés avec délectation).

2692,4d ago,"You can tell they put a good deal of thought into making this one maybe if for no other reason than to give the viewer connections to the original trilogy story. I have to nick the film for a few reasons. It tries so hard in the first half to try and be a drama with Anakin unsure of what he should do. The movie then segways into him completely changing course mentally almost immediately with one scene in particular seeming unbelievable by any stretch - he was conflicted before this scene but he does a complete 180 in seconds and it just seems haphazardly written here. The movie also does a disservice to our prequel heroine, Padme. She is reduced to a stand by your man 'til it kills you 50s style house wife; it's sad because she was a cool woman who could fend for herself in the first two films. She's turned into a prop here and it's only her acting that saves it from being a wash. Last ding is that it's hard to believe the Jedi didn't know the Sith Lord was right in front of them the whole time; they're supposed to be wise and have prophetic abilities. All that to say this: there are some great battle sequences including the best lightsaber battle in the series. The back and forth storytelling works well here to keep the viewer engaged. I can't say the film is easy to watch in the middle - Anakin's transition into Vader is not only convoluted but disturbing. It's especially hard to watch in juxtaposition to the rest of the series' tone. We can assume things about good and evil but to see Vader's fall from grace is very depressing. It is easily the least enjoyable 40ish minutes to watch in the whole saga. The first 40 and last 40 minutes however are enough to make it not only good but the best in the prequels. As a standalone story it is well done but not a movie you'll want to rewatch for fun - it's essential to the overarching story and that's it.",SHOW MORE,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith - Movie Reviews
2693,Aidan B,"Nov 20, 2021","Though the film can get a bit uneven at parts, the conclusion is ultimately satisfying and heartbreaking to watch as it wraps up this mediocre trilogy with spectacular fashion. ""Revenge of the Sith"" has the best story, CGI, and action of any of the prequel films made, and the film perfectly sets the stage for ""A New Hope."" I think that George Lucas had a perfect plan with this trilogy, though ended up failing in the process to get to this film. This third installment in the prequel trilogy is absolutely gorgeous to watch, and due to its very memorable and emotional moments throughout, ""Revenge of the Sith"" remains as one of the best ""Star Wars"" movie to date, despite its several flaws.",Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith - Movie Reviews

It explains Anakin's tragedy very well and the morality of the Jedi Order too. Great movie, i would suggest to Star Wars The Clone Wars Season 7 after the movie.

Also the plot itself is very epic and central for Star Wars itself. The focus in on emotions, imo the genre Space Opera gets a positive view by this movie, because it's theatralic and emotional. Dialogues and scenes might be too much ""set in scene"" for some people because they're classical theatre-like.

2729,Yuri L,"Sep 18, 2021","A very underrated movie. This film accomplished what the prequel trilogy was aiming to do, which was to elaborate on the backstory of Darth Vader and Palpatine's rise to power through the corruption of the republic. We are shown how Palpatine's manipulation of Anakin comes to fruition after years of careful planning. We see the failure of the Anakin Obi Wan relationship and the establishment of Luke and Leia's upbringings. This film also has an amazing score, including some of John William's finest works such as Battle of the Heros and Duel of the Fates. This film also makes excellent parallels with the rise of Hitler and the fall of democracy in post WW1 Germany. I do have some issues with this film, namely some of the acting is a little over the top. I also think the handling of Padme's death was rather cheesy. I think it would have been more fitting if it was eluded that Palpatine killed her instead of heartbreak.

This was my favorite movie growing up and I still have so much nostalgia for it. Anyone born in the 90s that is a star wars fan probably agrees that this was such a fun time to watch as a child. I remember my first time watching it and how amazing it was to see obiwan become ben and Anakin become Darth Vader. This inspired me to love movies the way I do today. Looking back at the movie now I definitely will note the cheesy dialogue here and there but it is still such a solid movie. I LOVE the lightsaber battles in this movie. I thought Ewan McGregor as obiwan was a perfect cast and Ian McDermott as Darth sidious is terrifying. Everyone should agree that this is by far the best of the prequel trilogy.

2737,ANDERSON G,"Sep 06, 2021","""Various Games: In Flames"" is a competent sequel but much less charismatic than its predecessor, shifting the focus to something more political, the transaction is good, the script is less linear but with continuity problems. The continuation of the franchise had more than 50 million in budget than its predecessor, although we don't feel this visually expressive improvement, the cache can have food a lot of the money, as we have a less authorial film that perpetuates what worked in the first one though it lacks a greater depth of the characters. ""Ravenous Games: On Fire"" hasn't aged as well as the first one, we feel a repetition of ideas, we have a climax that should have been built before, but the characters are still great and the performances at a good level such as costumes, makeup and soundtrack, in addition to photography, which improves significantly.

It is everything a sequel should be. This film has such an incredible fast pace and energy to it that makes it so enjoyable to watch. We also meet new characters in this film like Finnick and Johanna, who are also my two favorite characters in the series. My only main complaint is that I do think it feels a little bit too similar to the first film since we do have to go through all the training and interviews and prepping all over again since Katniss has to go back into the games.

These wonderful elements now are more blatant and over the top. Saying this though, this is the Marvel sequel we were all waiting for, incorporating unknown characters without brow-beating us about upcoming films in the MCU, potential spin-offs and sequels and just creating more depth in the Guardians universe.

2796,Nathan D,"Aug 06, 2021","This film is definitely a step-up from the first installment as the story is just so much better. James Gunn really poured a lot into this movie which led to such an amazing film. The overall message of the movie is so beautiful and offers so many iconic moments. The film always has something going on and a lot of the story details never get lost in other plots. Some aspects of the film are a tiny bit complicated, but it doesn't hurt the movie all that much. A large reason why this movie feels a lot more whole is that the characters are way better developed here. Peter's story excels greatly into something really beautiful. I would even say the same about Yondu as in the first film, Yondu didn't feel all that important. This film, however, made me greatly appreciate Yondu and his actions in the first film. Rocket, Gamora, and Nebula also get some more character development that I think benefited them greatly. Even new characters like Ego and Mantis were very easy to attach some type of connection to as they are both very well developed. The only character I would say is poorly written is Drax, which sucks because I really liked Drax in the first film. Drax came off as rude and annoying for a large part of the film and his jokes weren't all that funny this time around. As much as I loved the characters in this film from a story standpoint, the actors weren't all that great. Both Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana do a poor job in their roles. Their line delivery is off some of the time and I never felt the energy their performances had in the first film. Plus, both actors never convinced me that they had a love connection forming. Another actor that struggled was Dave Bautista. He was sometimes trying too hard to sell his joke or line that it came off in a cringeworthy way. However, the rest of the cast was pretty solid. Bradley Cooper did a fantastic job just like in the first film and new additions to the franchise Kurt Rusell and Pom Klementieff do an awesome job with both really nailing down the personalities of their characters. Michael Rooker is the stand-out to me in this film. Rooker had some great line delivery and really made the message of the film feel powerful and impactful. The production design of this film was flawless. Everything looked so stunning and the design of Ego's planet was just so well done. The color choices were great and how the technology on the planet moved was just so cool to watch. However, the cinematography felt a little weaker in this film. It was still very good, but I don't think cinematographer Henry Braham really made any shots look visually breathtaking like Ben Davis did in the first film. Something that did improve was the score. It was better than in the first one with Tyler Bates creating some memorable tracks and more of a balance between songs and the score. Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was definitely a step-up storywise, but somewhat of a step-down when looking at some of the cast. Even though I do like this film better than the first one, I do think the cast was a lot better in the first installment rather than the second. However, the strong, heartfelt story really hides all the casts' flaws and really sets this film over the top.

2797,Jonathan K,"Jul 29, 2021","The first Guardians of the Galaxy was a lot of insanity and a fair amount of heart -- this Sequel has a fair amount of insanity and a lot of heart. And I really mean it - much of the movie does ask that you feel ""this is funny"" or ""this is cool"", but there are numerous parts where the movie make you feel Mortified, Triumphant or even legitimately Sad. The final few minutes of the movie before the credits roll are absolutely spellbinding, and I literally tear-up every time I watch the final act of this movie. The final act is both Inspiring and then Heartbreaking shortly afterwards, and the fact that a Marvel movie has, upon multiple viewings, brought me to tears really shows how outstanding this film is. Like many, I would've liked a bit more insanity, but this is EASILY the Second Most Insane movie of the MCU (part 1 being the #1 spot), and since the trade-off was genuine emotional impact, I am more than happy with the exchange we got. If you love movies that cover a wide spectrum of emotions and does so effectively, then Guardians of the Galaxy 2 might be the best movie to do so in a very long time. You will laugh, you will cheer, your heartrate will occasionally rise and you will end it having had your soul crushed. In terms of pure entertainment and emotional impact and satisfaction, I'd argue this might be the best Space Opera since The Empire Strikes Back - yes, I really mean that.",Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 - Movie Reviews

2800,Cailan D,"Jul 23, 2021","GotG Vol. 2 isn't quite as good as its predecessor, but even though it does fall into the ""sequel is worse"" category, it still remains a solid and entertaining MCU blockbuster and comes close enough to the original to be enjoyable. The script doesn't have the finesse of the first movie causing the humor to drag and be a little over the top at points, but the actors do a fine job of getting around this causing a few of these moments to be genuinely funny. It's nice that this movie takes us deeper into the character of Peter Quill by exploring his family, a route that was set up well at the end of Guardians 1. What's even better about this is watching how Peter learning about and discovering his true family impacts his relationship with his ""new"" family: his fellow Guardians. This impact adds some emotional depth to the film, and makes Peter Quill a surprisingly complex character and takes him through a really nice arc that forces him to truly consider his relationships with those he cares about the most. Pratt supplements this with another great performance as the character, and his fellow Guardians castmates hit the spot as well. The movie makes sure to make good use of Kurt Russell as Ego by giving him plenty of screen time, a backstory, and a few emotional moments of his own. It also kicked ass to see the true power and capabilities of Yondu's flying arrow, something we got a taste of in the first movie but was amplified substantially in this movie. It's also still a relief and breath of fresh air that this film has no connection to the Avengers and the rest of the cinematic universe other than us knowing that it's a part of it. As mentioned before, what really prevents this movie from reaching the heights of GotG 1 for me is the humor, since even with the acting the script hampers this movie's ability to be as funny as GotG 1. GotG 2 is nonetheless still a fun and entertaining movie and is sure to leave viewers satisfied as the credits roll.",Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 - Movie Reviews

2820,Puroo R,"Aug 20, 2021","Pixar has made movies of all kinds - What if toys had feelings, what if insects had feelings, what if monsters had feelings, what if cars had feelings, what if fishes had feelings, what if rats had feelings. And now they have made Inside Out - what if feelings had feelings? Inside Out is probably one of the most underrated movies that Pixar has made. It was the first original Pixar movie which I didn't get to know about when it released (the first such one was a sequel, Monsters University), and I'm really surprised how this movie gets overlooked so easily. The way I see it, this movie is a social commentary about how we perceive life with our emotions. Riley here is a metaphor of us, how we feel when we move to a new place and are unable to handle the new life. In such situations we either feel scared, angry or depressed. When Riley starts crying in class, Joy tries to stop Sadness from ruining her memory with a vacuum but ends up destroying all her other memories. This is another metaphor from our lives, where we end up forgetting all our happy memories in times of desperation. Later on Joy and Sadness are in her memories, where they see Riley's childhood drawing of Bing Bong whom she considered her friend. The plot has been made with a complete sense of nostalgia. When we feel nostalgic, we feel both happiness and sadness at the same time. We are happy because we got to live those times, the time which was better than what we are living at the moment. We are sad because we know that time never stops, and so everyday we are straying further away from when it happened. We will never be able to live the day again, and it shall only stay in our memory. While Joy and Sadness are not present Fear, Anger and Disgust control her. I don't think I need to explain this. Riley has lost all her happiness and does not feel any sadness. Keep in mind she had previously cried in class, which is something very embarrassing for a ten year old child. As a result she does not want to show her sorrow in front of everyone since she fears people will laugh at her, so instead she tries to cover it with anger and disgust. This is just like how we behave when we are depressed but are also too afraid of what others might think if they learn about it. And then there is the memory dump, the place where the old memories are forgotten. This is one of the deepest messages that the movie gave us. To save Joy and Sadness and allow them to get out of the pit, Bing Bong readily sacrifices himself. This is because he had always considered himself and Riley friends, and he was ready to sacrifice his own life for this. It also shows how Riley has now lost the memory of Bing Bong due to her depression and frustration, and it is something she will never remember again. This is a metaphor of how we forget the small details from our childhood which gave us joy once we grow out of the phase. It also symbolises that although Bing Bong has been lost forever, Riley's joy and sadness will always remember him. This is similar to how we get nostalgic whenever we see our childhood writings and drawings. And finally when Joy and Sadness do make it back, then Joy chooses to let Sadness guide Riley. If she wanted she could have guided Riley and make her feel happy about reuniting with her parents. But in that case the moment would have completely lost the impact. So instead Sadness did it, which is why Riley started crying, something she had not done for a long time. This is yet another metaphor of when we are unable to hold our sorrow for too long and burst out crying. As a result her parents are finally able to understand the situation she is in and give her more love. In the end Riley starts feeling happy, since everyone has understood the value of Joy. She was the first emotion that Riley felt, and the one who guided them all in the time of desperation. All the other emotions came to her afterwards, which is why they are not as emotionally attached to Riley as Joy does. Joy knows what is the best for her, just like how we feel the best thing for our life is what makes us happy.",Inside Out,Inside Out - Movie Reviews

2825,Jacob R,"Jul 02, 2021","Just….how? How did Pixar make another flawless film after three films that I would either consider meh or bad? I just don't get it! Let's just make sure Pete Doctor directs every Pixar movie ever and we will be a-ok. I don't want to talk about all the good things with this movie, because let's face it: everyone has done that. Instead, I want to talk about all the things that this Pixar movie does better than all the others. First, I think this is the best voice cast for any Pixar movies prior or after this. The only one that kind of comes close for me is Toy Story 4, but that's for a different review. Biggest highlight is of course the great work of Amy Phoeler as Joy, it was just spot on. Next, comedy. Seeing how the main character is literally the concept of Joy, I would like to think that this movie was going to be funny. And I was right with this being, in my personal opinion, the funniest Pixar movie. Lewis Black as Anger is just a laughing riot to me. He was hilarious! Finally, how can you not talk about this movie without mentioning the ending, with two big emotional parts that really leave a huge impact. The first being the death of Bing Bong, which feels a little like it comes out of nowhere, but you're going to remember it. And, of course, when Riley comes home from running away and the parents also say that they miss the old home….OMG it's so good! The only kind of problem is that Anger is mainly the reason all the islands get destroyed, and no one addresses it at any moment. But that's minor, and no one is going to be thinking that in their first viewing, I only noticed it in my most previous viewing of the movie anyway. I really think someone should do a deeper dive into this movie, cause it really deserves it. However, I can only praise it for so long.

2834,Ethan T,"May 11, 2021","From a few of the same key players that brought Up, Inside Out is another profoundly affective animated drama guaranteed to pry emotion from anyone with a heart. The voice cast and animation all seem to be up to Pixar standard, while the emotion alone makes the film. The story combines the gut-wrenching and the fun, but does require the switching off of brains. Every story needs some logic or rules, even within a fantasy, to really work and have genuine stakes, and this just doesn't. You're introduced to the system, but you receive the feeling that elements and abilities In the moment, the film does more than enough to be positively memorable and pack a top-tier emotional punch, and this alone makes it good despite its numerous problems.",Inside Out,Inside Out - Movie Reviews

2844,Karol C,"Mar 22, 2021","Inside Out review A heartfelt animated movie, ""Inside Out"", takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions with creative imagination and a look back at some nostalgic moments we might have had in our childhood. Unlike any other, Pixar studios created an original movie of the emotions that go behind a person's mind and made them into having their own personalities. Focused on the mind of a little girl ,Riley her life is shown as typically any perfect childhood. With the presence of the emotion joy it shows her story of her two loving parents raising her and living the life with many moments that one child creates. Including the building of humor, friendship and playing your favorite sport. But as all children go through the other emotions such as sadness, fear ,disgust and anger it will include her experiences. However, her life takes a sudden turn when she has to move with her parents from their hometown Minnesota to San Francisco. Her emotions will be put to the test in adapting to a new lifestyle they're typically unused to. To start off , it shows the beginning of the first years in Riley's life. Transitioning from stages to the preteens years of her life. This is where she experiences many emotions and personal likeness and dislikeness. Riley is seen on her journey as she experiences all typical childhood memories. From learning how to walk to talking your first new words. Discovering your least favorite meal to favorite toy to take with you everywhere. The laughter you create and the sad moments you experience. The rewarding moments of receiving a good grade to being upset for losing an important game. As Riley is growing she has experienced majority exciting emotions until a certain news comes to her attention. She will be moving from her childhood home Minnesota, where she was born, raised, and grew up to miles away into the city of San Francisco. Despite the change , her emotion Joy makes Riley see all this in a positive way. Meeting new friends, decorating a new room and many more ideas. Arriving at the new location, Riley is quick to notice the drastic change in seeing her new home. Adapting to the city and less outdoor activity is one of the unfortunate changes making her find new adventures. On her first day of school, she is introduced to her classmates and told to talk a bit more from her time back home. As she recalls some of her favorite memories, the emotion sadness touches her favorite memory, changing Riley's memory to a sad moment and turning it into a sorrowful memory. Joy continues to try and make Riley enjoy the new memories. After they had another similar disagreement Joy and Sadness cause the core memories to be knocked from their containers and accidentally vacuumed along with them into Riley's emotional interior. With this problem, it leaves the other emotions Fear, Disgust and Anger to run the emotions until the others return changing RIleys behavior. Throughout the film it shows the many obstacles and challenges Joy and Sadness must go through to reach the headquarters. Following with revisiting old memories and lifelong imaginary friends. It will take a spin through some future glimpse some being Riley's future boyfriend and many more. Overall this unfortunate event turned out to be a better lesson. The emotions appreciating each other's teamwork to help Riley have the best life she could as she grows up. Enjoying the moments one creates as living life with a positive attitude.",Inside Out,Inside Out - Movie Reviews

2851,Nattapong S,"Mar 10, 2021","Normally, Almost every animation which are made by Disney and Pixar are interesting to most people because they mostly fun, happy to watch, beautiful graphic, etc. , but I think 'Inside out' is more than that. I have remembered that in the time this movie has been released, it was very famous. But I have not seen it yet until two months ago that I watched it. The first time I have seen this movie to the end. I understood to many media why they rated this animated movie very high. First It is about the graphic of the animation. As we have known. Disney and Pixar are one of the best animation studios about graphic, and they have done to this movie very well, such as an appearance of a character. There are lots of details about graphic, sharpness of the video, etc. Second, sound effect. In my opinion. Sound effect are very important to every movie in the scenes that want to show, or express more the feeling to the audiences than only the movie scene. And this movie expresses the feeling to the audiences very well such as happy, sad, scared. The last thing and it is the most interesting point is about feeling. It is what this movie expresses to us. For me, this part is the point that makes this movie different to other animation movies that Disney and Pixar have made. It is more than a movie for entertaining. It teaches us how we can control our feeling , however I will not tell you what feeling that I mean. I want you find it by yourself in the movie. Then after you watch it, you will understand what I have told to you. But there is one inferior point in this movie. It is distribution of the character. Some characters are very notable, but there are few characters have a few of air time, scenes that they act. In my opinion, 'Inside out' is still one of my best animation movie. For me, I give it 1/3 of the best Disney and Pixar movie of all time. If anyone is looking for some full of quality movie. 'Inside out' is the great choice. concluding, very well work for Disney and Pixar making this movie. I give 9 out of 10. I hope you enjoy my review more or less.

My only critique is the film was originally shot to be about two-and-a-half hours and was shortened by the studio and included reshoots. Originally Tessa Thompson's character 142 was to have more backstory, Hela's arrival was completely altered by CGI from what was seen in the trailer BUT what did work in reshoots was the addition of a funny ‘theatrical' performance including an Oscar winning actor.",Thor: Ragnarok,Thor: Ragnarok - Movie Reviews

We can't have economic freedom without bodily autonomy and basic civil liberties as well as a government that enforces those liberties. Kidnapping Fischer was a vicious, cowardly and morally bankrupt and not the work of a hero. I disliked the character so much I didn't care what happened to them so the movie was boring as well. The fact this ham fisted, pedantic and desultory film is supposed to be ""intelligent"" is particularly disturbing. Imagine a future where computer nerds rule the world by forcibly kidnapping us and then implanting ""good"" ideas into our brains and those of our children to make sure we do the ""right"" thing.

Then I watched it again and appreciated the extremely impressive elements of it much more. The directing talent from Christopher Nolan is truly remarkable and the special effects/CGI is great. The action scenes especially in the middle of the film were my favorite parts, plus the ending scene. Not to mention the cast of actors that they were able to have participate in the production, very noteworthy. The film does have some issues though that may alienate some viewers. Much of the phenomenon in the movie is left up to a lot of interpretation and can make your mind too blown while you're still trying to keep up with the plot. It can be a lot to take in all at once and confuse people who aren't used to a movie like this. Plus I think that the romance between Cobb and Mal bogged down the main mission of the team a little too much, but I still see why something like that was included. Overall a pretty good movie! There is a lot to say about this movie and many ways to analyze it and that's why it was popular I guess!",Inception,Inception - Movie Reviews

2960,Stefano D,"Aug 27, 2021","A perfectly paced, written and directed story that will send your mind to an endless pondering and mesmerising journey. Nolan really knows what he's doing when it comes fiction. He knows how to deliberately lose the audience's comprehension to then retrieve it with magnificence. What truly makes Nolan's famous fiction movie Inception a masterpiece of time and reality mayhem, is the way the story is written and developed. It starts with a pretty strenuous concept: the inception of dreams. But then, as the story unwraps, with well-pace actions, embracing dialogues and great characters dissections, we begin to fathom what this concept of infiltrating dreams can serve for, alongside how it actually works – using great insight of true physics and thorough studies upon the very subject of dreams and time. All leading to an ending that wraps into this ""open ways"" notion. The casting is straight up perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio embraced the role of Dom Cobb as a professional, really diving into the trauma of the protagonist and exploiting the pain and adventurous errands that this character went through in his past. Tom Hardy nailed the role of the Eames, a character capable of impersonating others within one's dream, using his seriousness and his passionate sheer acting. Cillian Murphy, managed to play the role of a broken son left with the legacy of his dead father like a boss, using his prowess acting and his bewitching voice. And last, but not least, Eliott Page, who really knows how to do her job and create an emotional and interesting character, Ariadne, ready to help her team as the ingenious architect of dreams. I could spend a day writing about the story and how the cast, the full cast, is perfectly chosen, but I think the points I've given are enough to catch your attention – without spoiling the whole narrative – if you haven't seen the movie yet.",Inception,Inception - Movie Reviews

2973,Jonathan K,"Oct 25, 2021","There are few objectively bad cinematic experiences that I like as much as the Michael Bay Transformers movies, but Part 2: Revenge of the Fallen, is the one I will never rush to defend. It's aggressive, it's loud, it's obnoxious, it's WAY too long, and I never thought I'd say this about a Michael Bay movie, but: It feels Lazy. This last one is the biggest oddity in regards to this movie, as Michael Bay's biggest problem has always been that it feels like he Directs and Edits after drinking a double-dosage of RedBalls Energy Drink (for those that watched Chapelle Show), but half of this movie looks like Bay just Directed it after taking Melatonin, as the cinematography is surprisingly plain, the stunts less intense than his usual work, the action blocking is a lot less intricate than with any other movie of his, and there's so much in this movie that simply did not need to exist that it felt like Bay was shooting most of this out of obligation. Let's throw in the fact that this movie is simultaneously the Most Comedic yet Least Funny entry of his Transformers movies, and you also have a movie that suffers greatly from inconsistent tone (a problem the others suffered from as well but not nearly to the degree here). The one distinctly good moment in this movie is a desperate fight in the forest between Optimus Prime and several Decipticons, as it's one that plays out with genuine stakes, has weighty consequences, ends on a powerful note and feature's excellent cinematography, choreography and sound design. It's a shame as this bit is genuinely great, the sole legitimately shining moment in a movie that balances between low-tier mediocrity and the outright awful.",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen - Movie Reviews

2976,Puroo R,"Aug 18, 2021","When I had heard everyone say that Transformers movies keep getting worse as time moves on I was actually very hesitant to watch this. I really liked the first movie so there was no way I could believe that THIS franchise could possibly be bad (although I did see that later on, I didn't see it here). In my review of the first movie I said how I got interested in the Transformers franchise after watching it, since I didn't know this was actually a toys company and not an anime series. If that movie was just the introduction, this was where the real action takes place. I saw Revenge of the Fallen on Amazon Prime soon after the first one. I only had one week left before my Prime subscription would expire, so I had only decided to dedicate this time to watching all the Transformers movies so that I could understand what this franchise is all about. Unlike the future movie this one actually expanded on what was established at the first movie. Although the human characters were not as interesting as the previous movie and the story was also pretty much empty, the action scenes completely made up for it. As usual the CGI and action was very good. The new characters introduced were fun to watch. I really like to see it when new characters are brought in and given their own character development as they transform into cool cars. However not everything about this movie was good. Like I said above the human characters were not as interesting. The entire blood about Sam going to college and his parents continuously pestering him was very annoying. This was the last time we got to see Mikaela, which is also something very sad IYKWIM. This movie was able to explain very well the entire concept of Transformers, something that the prequel fail to do so. Before I used to think that Autobots and Decepticons are supposed to be cars, but now I know that they are actually robots which can turn themselves into whatever they see in front of them. I would definitely give a rewatch afterwards sometime in the future whenever I have to show this franchise to a new generation.",Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen - Movie Reviews

The movie isn't finished yet, and you can tell; there are some funny awkward jokes strewn around, and there are a few minor narrative holes here and there, but I can see where they're heading, and I LOVE it. The plot is very interesting to explore, including the history of Transformers and the lasting effects of that legacy that transcends time. Also you will not find better action in any other film than in this one; the action is nonstop and visually appealing and it will keep you at the edge of your seat.

While I do think the opening and closing moments of the movie are solid, I think this movie seriously drags in the middle. For a movie that is supposed to be the big finally, this movie is super underwhelming. As usual, the acting and dialogue aren't great, but this movie mercifully doesn't focus much on the unconvincing romance in this series. I just feel the way it ends is kind of a cop-out, happily ever after type of ending, and it makes the whole series feel a bit pointless. I can't speak on behalf of the book but I think this franchise saw an opportunity to make some money and dragged this story into two full-length movies when in reality just one big two and a half hour movie might have been handled more neatly and effectively.

In Part 2, Bella and Edward's love-child brings a conflict between the Cullen family, the pack of werewolves lead by Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) and the Volturi cult led by Aro (Michael Sheen). Having not seen the other films or read the Stephanie Meyer books, I could never follow why being immortal would be a threat to the Volturi vampires or how the vampires inexplicably gain powers like chopping logs like a cheese cracker, superspeed, or super-jump. It also didn't help that the visual effects are far below the standards of a Sci-Fi channel movie, demonstrated by the werewolves, motion blurs, the backdrops, and the baby. Another list of stupidity: Bella learning to act human, the elemental powers that contribute nothing to vampirism, the ethnic stereotypes, and the climactic battle near the end which was all a vision. The only redeeming and entertaining value in the whole series so far is Michael Sheen, who bites the scenery gloriously and even has that silly hammy laugh as an act of threat. While nicely shot and not with some crazy and funny moments, Breaking Dawn Part 2 is still a poorly written, poorly acted and poorly directed mess.

This one is my favorite because Bella becomes less annoying (turns out all this time Kristen Stewart wasn't the worst actress ever- it was just Bella who was the most annoying character). Also I'm just as much of a sucker for a screen full of beautiful faces as the next girl. I cried at the end, when the final song started to play. Sigh. Silliness.

Nothing happens for the entire movie, but, don't worry, it's all building up for the much anticipated finale when. . .nothing happens. For most of the movie, characters stand around, stare at each other and occasionally recite lines. The only eventful part of the story is nothing but a cheap fake-out. Without Rifftrax, I wouldn't have made it through this terrible film. Good riddance, Twilight.",The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 - Movie Reviews

3043,Jacob B,"Aug 21, 2019","The best Twilight film...mostly owing to the fact that it's the last one of these suckers (no pun intended). There's a final battle that's actually quite badass, despite being remarkably gore-free for an all-out massacre...which then leads to probably the cheapest movie cop-out I've ever seen in a movie, though I won't spoil it for you. Michael Sheen has more screen time after being limited to just two scenes in the terrible New Moon movie and only allowed to have a Marvel-style mid-credits scene cameo in the last movie. And, the movie for once isn't boring with some nice cinematography and a decent opening credits sequence. It's still not good despite being the best film but I'd rather take an average fantasy action film than a dull romance anytime. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson's performances aren't any different from what we're used to seeing from them at this point, the ending is probably not as happy as Stephenie Meyer and Bill Condon seem to think it is and it's clear the special effects budget was dedicated to just the final battle because Bella and Edward running looks abysmally fake and the CGI baby is much more creepy here than in Part 1. Did I mention the cheap cop-out? I think I did. Glad to get this franchise over with though I might see the adaptation of The Host, seeing how the book is written by the same author. It is fascinating to see how a series that was always generally considered to be not good still managed to have movies that were all hugely successful at the box office. While there have been good first films followed by a series of crappy sequels such as Transformers and the Resident Evil movie series, Twilight was considered to be a bad film franchise from many detractors since day one yet the sequels still managed to show up amongst the 10 highest-grossing films of the year from 2009 to 2012. We might never get a definitive answer as to just how popular this series ended up being but for the time being, let's all take a moment and feel either relieved or sad that this series has come to an end.",The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 2,The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 - Movie Reviews
